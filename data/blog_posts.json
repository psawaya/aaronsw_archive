But when I\ntell my friends this, they recoil in horror. \u201cThat bastard?\u201d one friend\ncries. \u201cHe [tripled my\nrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle#The_landlord_and_the_city_government)!\u201d\n\u201cOh geebus,\u201d another cries. \u201cThe Chinese Room argument is *awful*.\u201d\n\nI will not profess to have an opinion on whether the fourteenth\namendment requires the City of Berkeley to provide a rational basis for\nonly allowing its landlords to raise rents at forty percent of the\nincrease in the consumer price index, but I must admit I fail to see\nwhat the question has to do with Searle as a philosopher.\n\nThe other complaint seems less *ad hominem*, but I think is\nfundamentally similar. Reading Searle\u2019s published books, it\u2019s striking\nhow little space the Chinese Room Argument takes up. Indeed, his book on\nthe subject of consciousness \u2014 *The Rediscovery of the Mind* \u2014 gives it\nlittle more than a paragraph and notes that his more recent argument\nagainst functionalism is far more powerful.\n\nNonetheless, I will defend the Chinese Room Argument. The basic idea,\nfor those who aren\u2019t familiar with it, is this: imagine yourself being\nplaced in a room and given instructions on how to convert one set of\nChinese symbols to another. To outsiders, if the instructions are good\nenough, it will seem as if you understand Chinese. But you do not\nconsciously understand Chinese \u2014 you are simply following instructions.\nThus, no computer can ever consciously understand Chinese, because no\ncomputer does more than what you\u2019re doing \u2014 it\u2019s simply following a set\nof instructions. (Indeed, being unconscious, it\u2019s doing far less.)\n\nThe Chinese Room Argument works mainly as a forcing maneuver. There are\nonly two ways out of it: you can either claim that no one is conscious\nor that everything is conscious. If you claim that no one is conscious,\nthen there is no problem. Sure, the man doesn\u2019t consciously understand\nChinese, but he doesn\u2019t consciously understand English either. However,\nI don\u2019t think anyone can take this position with a straight face. (Even\nDaniel Dennett is embarrassed to admit it in public.)\n\nThe alternative is to say that while perhaps the man doesn\u2019t consciously\nunderstand Chinese, the *room* does. (This is functionalism.) I think\nit\u2019s pretty patently absurd, but Searle provides a convincing\nrefutation. Functionalists argue that information processes lead to\nconsciousness. Running a certain computer program, whether on a PC or by\na man with a book or by beer cups and ping pong balls, will cause that\nprogram to be conscious. Searle points out that this is impossible;\ninformation processes can\u2019t cause consciousness because they\u2019re not\nbrute facts. We (conscious humans) look at something and decide to\n*interpret* it as an information process; but such processes don\u2019t exist\nin the world and thus can\u2019t have causal powers.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDespite the obvious weakness of the arguments, why do so many of my\nfriends continue to believe in functionalism? The first thing to notice\nis that most of my friends are computer programmers. There\u2019s something\nabout computer programming that gets you thinking that the brain is\nnothing more than a special kind of program.\n\nBut once you do that, you\u2019re stuck. Because one property of computer\nprograms is that they can run on any sort of hardware. The same program\ncan run on your Mac or a PC or a series of gears and pulleys. Which\nmeans it must be the program that\u2019s important; the hardware can\u2019t be\nrelevant. Which is patently absurd.\n\nI used to think that part of the reason my friends believed this was\nbecause they had no good alternatives. But I\u2019ve since explained to them\nSearle\u2019s alternative \u2014 consciousness is a natural phenomenon which\ndeveloped through evolutionary processes and is caused by the actions of\nthe brain in the same way solidity is caused by the actions of atoms \u2014\nand it hasn\u2019t caused them to abandon their position one bit.\n\nSo I tried a different tack. I asked them what they thought was wrong\nwith Searle\u2019s position. And the answer always seems to come down to a\nconfusion between ontology and epistemology. Ontology is a fancy word\nfor the facts of the matter \u2014 what actually exists out in the world. And\nepistemology is the world for the way we know about it. Unless you\nsubscribe to a bizarre philosophical theory, things in the world exist\nirrespective of whether we know them or not. Behind the TV game show\ndoor, there either is a car or there isn\u2019t, even if no one can see in to\ntell which one is the case. Furthermore, things continue to exist even\nif we can\u2019t even know them in principle. There appears to be no way for\nme to ever tell what it feels like for you to taste an orange;\nnonetheless, there is indeed something that it feels like for you.\n\nMy programmer friends\u2019 argument always ends up coming down to this: if a\ncomputer program acted conscious, if it plaintively insisted that it was\nconscious, if it acted in all respects like the conscious people we know\nin the real world, then it must be conscious. How could we possibly tell\nif it was not? In short, they believe in the Turing Test as a test for\nconsciousness \u2014 anything that acts smart enough to make us think it\u2019s\nconscious must be conscious.\n\nThis was the position Ned Block was trying to refute when he postulated\na computer program known as Blockhead. Blockhead is a very simple\n(although very large) computer program. It simply contains a list of all\npossible thirty minute conversations. When you say something, Blockhead\nlooks it up in the list, and says whatever the list says it\u2019s supposed\nto say next. (Obviously such a list would be unreasonably long in\npractice, perhaps even when heavily compressed, but let us play along\ntheoretically.)\n\nHaving a conversation with Blockhead would be just like having a\nconversation with a real person. But nobody could seriously claim the\nprogram was conscious, right? Well, in fact they do.\n\nOne wonders whether these people think their cell phones are conscious.\nAfter all, talking to a properly-enabled cell phone works just like\ntalking to a properly-enabled person! (I asked one friend this and his\nresponse was that the whole system containing the cell phone and the\nwires and the person on the other end was conscious.)\n\nThe point is that we don\u2019t assign consciousness purely based on\nbehavior. Blockhead acts like it\u2019s conscious and a completely paralyzed\nperson acts like they\u2019re not, yet we all know that the first isn\u2019t\nconscious and the second is. Instead, we assign consciousness based on\ncauses. We know dogs are conscious because we know they have brains that\nare very much like ours which cause behavior very much like ours. We\ndon\u2019t make that judgment based on behavior alone.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCriticisms aside, what is the positive argument for John Searle? First,\nhe has done important work in a wide variety of fields. As far as I can\ntell, he began following up the works of his teachers (like J. L.\nAustin) on the topic of speech acts, which he generalized to the subject\nof intentionality, which he solved by saying it was a property of\nconscious beings, which led him to develop a theory of consciousness.\nSecond, all of his points seem quite reasonable to me and (with a few\nexceptions) I agree with them. Third, he writes extremely clearly and\nentertainingly and for a popular audience.\n\nThese three seem like a fairly low bar \u2014 they\u2019re about what I would\nexpect from myself were I a philosopher \u2014 but its shocking how few\nprominent philosophers seem to meet them. Daniel Dennett is a dreadfully\nprolix writer and is insane. Thomas Nagel comes close but is a fairly\ncommitted dualist. Hilary Putnam doesn\u2019t write for a popular audience.\nPeter Singer doesn\u2019t seem to develop any actual theories. So I can\u2019t\nthink of any. Can you?

You can have each\nwithout the other: you can be genuinely mistaken and thereby say\nsomething false without intending to mislead, and you can intentionally\nmislead someone without ever saying anything that\u2019s untrue. (The second\nis generally considered deceit, but not dishonesty.)\n\nHowever, you can be intellectually dishonest without doing *either* of\nthese things. Imagine that you\u2019re conducting an experiment and most of\nthe time it comes out exactly the way you expect but one time it goes\nwrong (you probably just screwed up the measurements). Telling someone\nabout your work, you say: \u201cOh, it works just the way I expected \u2014 seven\ntimes it came out exactly right.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t untrue and it isn\u2019t intentionally misleading \u2014 you really do\nbelieve it works the way you expected. But it is intellectually\ndishonest: intellectual honesty requires bending-over-backwards to\nprovide any evidence that you might be wrong, *even if you\u2019re convinced\nthat you are right*.\n\nThis is an impractical standard to apply to everyday life. A prospective\nemployer asks you in a job interview if you can get to work on time. You\nsay \u201cYes\u201d, not \u201cI think so, but one time in 2003 the power went out and\nso my alarm didn\u2019t go off and I overslept\u201d. I don\u2019t think anyone\nconsiders this dishonesty; indeed, if you were intellectually honest all\nthe time people would think you were pretty weird.\n\nScience has a higher standard. It\u2019s not just between you and your\nemployer, it\u2019s a claim to posterity. And you might be wrong, but what if\nyou\u2019re not around for posterity to call you up and ask you to show your\nwork? That\u2019s why intellectual honesty requires you show your work in\nadvance, so that others can see if you\u2019re missing something.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1323849600.0, "postid": "intellectualdishonesty", "internal_links": []}, "twitview": {"post_title": "My Twitter Viewer", "tags": [], "post_content": "My Twitter Viewer\n=================\n\nJanuary 4, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/twitview)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI published this [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/aaronsw), but here\u2019s a\nblog post as well:\n\nI made a little [Twitter viewer](http://twitter.theinfo.org/) that takes\na Tweet ID (you can find them in the URL of a tweet\u2019s page on\ntwitter.com) and shows you the whole conversation for that tweet.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-   [Glenn Greenwald on the insurance\n    file](http://twitter.theinfo.org/20496113098301440)\n-   [The epic Ptacek-Kaminsky\n    debate](http://twitter.theinfo.org/21994946588319745)\n-   [Kevin Poulsen explains what\u2019s not in the\n    logs](http://twitter.theinfo.org/20293552433004544)\n\nThe idea is to a) make it easier to read these conversations, b) make it\neasier to provide replies, c) provide a permanent link to what\u2019s\nbecoming an increasingly-important conversation space.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/aaronsw", "http://twitter.theinfo.org/", "http://twitter.theinfo.org/20496113098301440", "http://twitter.theinfo.org/21994946588319745", "http://twitter.theinfo.org/20293552433004544"], "time": 1294128000.0, "postid": "twitview", "internal_links": []}, "stanford2sfp": {"post_title": "Stanford/SFP: Leaving on a Jet Plane", "tags": [], "post_content": "Stanford/SFP: Leaving on a Jet Plane\n====================================\n\nJune 11, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/stanford2sfp)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s always odd how extraordinary things are just like their ordinary\ncounterparts.

I decide to go on an exploratory mission with just one\nbag to find my room before carrying everything down. It\u2019s a good thing I\ndid since the elevator is surrounded by three cops. In front of them,\nthe elevator door is open revealing a whole group of kids in an elevator\nstuck halfway between floors. The kids seem resigned to their situation\nand are now sitting on the floor playing games. \u2018I don\u2019t trust these\nf\u2014-ing elevators,\u2019 says one cop. \u2018No way, me neither,\u2019 answers another.\nI decide to back away to give them some space.\n\nAfter a short rest I decide to try the other elevator and it turns out\nit\u2019s much closer, so I laboriously drag my bags up and thru using it. On\nthe way to my room there is a picture window onto a deck with some sort\nof yin-yang sculpture. The kids have filled it up with water and place\nrubber duckies into it. Unfortunately, getting onto the deck requires a\nkeycard, which I don\u2019t have.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSimmons Hall is indeed pretty, if a little warm. (Apparently the\ncomputer lab is the only air conditioned room.) Meeting rooms of various\nsorts are scattered throughout the place, each fitted with a whiteboard\nand prints from Josef Albers\u2019s *Interaction of Color*.\n\nOddly, each print is also accompanied by a note with a number to call\nwith \u201cquestions and concerns\u201d about the artwork. (I imagine the MIT\nstudent who calls and says \u201cI have a concern about print \\#49. Albers\nclearly intended to use a 3,4,5 sequence but on the last square here\nit\u2019s printed as 3,4,6. Do you think you could send someone to take care\nof this?\u201d)\n\nThere are also a series of kitchens and TV rooms, each differently\nshaped and furnished. Each TV room has a DVD player, VCR, and stairs up\nto the next floor where, in a different location, there is another room\nwith a different shape and furnishings.\n\nThe floor plans of the building are printed by the elevator (for use in\ncase of fire, I guess) and they\u2019re rather entertaining.

Inside was a\nstrange-looking device, a switch, and a bunch of wires. Outside was a\nlight (currently off) that said \u201cDIRECT FROM THE FUTURE\u201d. I tried\nfiguring out what the box was, with little success. The whole thing felt\nlike a puzzle out of Myst or something.\n\nThe one thing I couldn\u2019t find, however, was a bathroom on my floor. I\nfound a whole series of locked rooms with interesting labels \u2014\nCounseling, Student Government, Mail, Music, and my personal favorite\n(if only because it was the one with no lock) Meditation \u2014 but no\nbathroom. Finally I tried to open the unmarked door next to my room and\naha! a bathroom. Nice location, too. The only problem is it doesn\u2019t have\nlock.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next day as I walk outside I\u2019m hit in the face by Cambridge\u2019s\ndreadful weather. Unbearably snowy in the winter, it\u2019s unbearably hot\nand muggy in the summer. I guess it wasn\u2019t just because I was carrying\nbags yesterday that I was sweating. I walk the superblock to the student\ncenter where I get some food and buy a fan for my room. It makes things\na little better but it\u2019s still pretty terrible.\n\nAnyone in Cambridge got an air conditioner I could borrow? Maybe I\nshould find someplace to buy one. **UPDATE:** The good folks at Y\nCombinator brought me over an air conditioner which we jammed into one\nof the windows and now it\u2019s awesome. *Thanks!*\n\nFinally, if anyone nearby wants to visit, just drop me an email.", "external_links": [], "time": 1118473200.0, "postid": "stanford2sfp", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/photos/sfp/IMG_2810.JPG/view"]}, "googlife": {"post_title": "The Goog Life: how Google keeps employees by treating them like kids", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Goog Life: how Google keeps employees by treating them like kids\n====================================================================\n\nDecember 13, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/googlife)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI was talking with a friend the other day about that perennial subject\nof conversation in the Valley, Google. And finally she gave me the clue\nthat made the whole place make sense. \u201cIt\u2019s about infantilizing people,\u201d\nshe explained. \u201cGive them free food, do their laundry, let them sit on\nbouncy brightly-colored balls. Do everything so that they never have to\ngrow up and learn how to live life on their own.\u201d\n\nAnd when you look at it that way, everything Google does makes a sick\nsort of sense.\n\nNot a whole lot has changed since the last time I visited Google. The\ncampus is bigger \u2014 the buildings across the street, instead of being\nreserved for lawyers and other lowlifes, are now being used by the\nengineering staff as well, to keep up with Google\u2019s nonstop growth. And\nthe employees seem a little less excited about things than the last time\nI was there. Nobody says \u201cWe\u2019re on a mission to change the world!\u201d\nanymore. Now they say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just going to stick around here\nanother six months until my options vest.\u201d and \u201cI kind of want to\ntransfer out of my group but I worry that all the other groups are\nworse.\u201d\n\nBut the two blatant changes to the campus are a large, terribly\nfake-looking replica of SpaceShipOne hanging in the middle of the main\nbuilding and a replica dinosaur skeleton standing outside. \u201cIt\u2019s as if\nthis place is being decorated by seven-year-olds,\u201d a friend comments. It\nalso reminds me of Robert Reich\u2019s comment about Newt Gingrich: \u201cHis\noffice is adorned with figurines of dinosaurs, as you might find in the\nbedrooms of little boys who dream of one day being huge and powerful.\u201d\n\nThe dinosaurs and spaceships certainly fit in with the infantilizing\ntheme, as does the hot tub-sized ball pit that Googlers can jump into\nand throw ball fights. Everyone I know who works there either acts\nchildish (the army of programmers), enthusiastically adolescent (their\nmanagers and overseers), or else is deeply cynical (the hot-shot\nprogrammers). But as much as they may want to leave Google, the\ninfantilizing tactics have worked: they\u2019re afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able\nto survive anywhere else.\n\nGoogle hires programmers straight out of college and tempts them with\nall the benefits of college life. Indeed, as the hiring brochures\nstress, the place was explicitly modeled upon college. At one point, I\nwondered why Google didn\u2019t just go all the way and build their own\ndormitories. After all, weren\u2019t the late-night dorm-room conversations\nwith others who were smart like you one of the best parts of college\nlife? But as the gleam wears off the Google, I can see why it\u2019s no place\nanyone would want to hang around for that long. Even the suburban desert\nof Mountain View is better.\n\nGoogle\u2019s famed secrecy doesn\u2019t really do a very good job of keeping\ninformation from competitors. Those who are truly curious can pick up\nenough leaks and read enough articles to figure out how mostly\neverything works. But what it does do is create an aura of impossibility\naround the place. People read the airbrushed versions of Google\ntechnologies in talks and academic papers and think that Google has some\namazingly large computer lab with amazingly powerful technology. But\nhang around a Googler long enough and you\u2019ll hear them complain about\nthe unreliability of GFS and how they don\u2019t really have enough computers\nto keep up with the load.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always frightening when you see how the sausage actually gets\nmade,\u201d explains a product manager. And that\u2019s exactly what the secrecy\nis supposed to prevent. The rest of the world sees Google as this\nimpenetrable edifice with all the mysteries of the world inside (\u201cI hear\nonce you\u2019ve worked there for 256 days they teach you the secret\nlevitation,\u201d [explains xkcd](http://xkcd.com/c192.html)) while the\nselect few inside the walls know the truth \u2014 there is no there there \u2014\nand are bound together by this burden.\n\nSuch a strategy may have worked in the early days, when Googlers were a\nselect and special few, but as the company grows larger and employee\u2019s\nidentification with it grows thinner, Google has to step up their\nefforts to acculturate.

I now live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just\ndown the street from where it was stolen. Seth Shulman\u2019s recent book*\n[The Telephone Gambit](http://books.theinfo.org/go/039333368X) *lays out\nthe clearest case yet of how it all happened. Here\u2019s the summary:*\n\nAlexander Graham Bell (or Aleck Bell, as he was then called) was the son\nof Alexander Melville Bell, the inventor of a system of phonic notation\ncalled Visible Speech. The elder Bell would use Aleck as an assistant in\nhis demonstrations: After sending Aleck to wait in another room, Mr.\nBell would ask the audience for a word or strange noise then write it in\nVisible Speech. Aleck would return and reproduce the sound from the\nwriting alone. Voila.\n\nAs a child growing up like this, he played at inventing machines that\ncould talk and telegraphs that could listen. But he found his career in\ntutoring the deaf \u2014 by teaching them to pronounce the phonemes of\nVisible Speech, he eventually succeeded in teaching them to talk and\nread lips.\n\nOne of his students was Mabel Hubbard, daughter of prominent Boston\nlawyer Gardiner Greene Hubbard. Son of a Massachusetts Supreme Court\nJustice, Hubbard established water and gas and trolley utilities for\nCambridge, Mass. \u2014 some of the first in the nation. He also fervently\nlobbied Congress to replace Western Union\u2019s monopoly on the telegraph\nwith a new corporation, the US Postal Telegraph Company, that would\ncontract with the government Post Office.\n\nAt the time, telegraph wires blanketed the skies of Boston, hanging in a\ndense web above the buildings. Many desperately wished for someone to\ndevelop a telegraph that could send multiple messages over the same\nwire, so that many wires could be replaced with just one. The theory was\nthat if one could transmit the messages using different tones, they\nwould \u201charmonize\u201d instead of interfere, leading the idea to be called\nthe \u201charmonic telegraph\u201d. Naturally, Alexander Graham Bell turned his\ntinkering to this problem and persuaded Hubbard (as well as Thomas\nSanders, another father of a Bell student) to finance his research in\nexchange for a share of any future US profits. Further complicating\nmatters, Bell had fallen in love with his student, Mabel Hubbard. Mr.\nHubbard made it clear he did not approve of such a marriage unless Bell\nmade a profitable discovery.\n\nBut Bell was simply a hobbyist, the real research was being done by a\nman named Elisha Gray. Gray ran Western Electric, the leading supplier\nof technical expertise to telegraph monopoly Western Union. From his lab\nin Highland Park, Illinois, he and his assistants worked feverishly at\nnew discoveries. Bell was well aware of this and considered himself to\nbe in a race with Gray to invent the harmonic telegraph first.\n\nIn 1875, Bell made a breakthrough in his work on the harmonic telegraph.\nBut he was a crafty fellow \u2014 his deal with Gardiner and Sanders was only\nabout splitting *US* profits; it said nothing about profits overseas.\nBritish law at the time granted patents only to inventions not patented\nelsewhere first, so Bell drew up several copies of his harmonic\ntelegraph patent and sent some to be filed in Britain first. The rest\nwere sent to DC to be filed as soon as word got back from Britain.\n\nOn February 14, 1876, while the lawyers were waiting in DC to file\nBell\u2019s patent, Gray filed a patent of his own. Bell\u2019s lawyers were close\nto the patent officers and had asked to be tipped off if Gray tried to\nfile something, so they could file Bell\u2019s patent first. When Gray\u2019s\npatent was placed in the patent office\u2019s inbox, Bell\u2019s lawyers\nhand-delivered Bell\u2019s patent to the examiner, so they could claim he\u2019d\nreceived Bell\u2019s first.\n\nThe patent examiner, Zenas Fisk Wilber, had fought in the civil war with\nBell\u2019s attorney, Marcellus Bailey. Wilber was an alcoholic and owed\nBailey money (a serious Patent Office ethics violation). To pay his\nfriend back, he showed him Gray\u2019s application. Bailey was startled to\nfind it wasn\u2019t a patent on a harmonic telegraph at all \u2014 it was a patent\nfor a telephone, capable of transmitting all the sounds of human speech\nand music. He called for Bell to come to DC at once.\n\nBell did, and examiner Wilber showed him Gray\u2019s patent as well, taking\ntime to explain how it worked. Bell thanked him and returned that\nafternoon with \\$100 for his trouble. Bell then quickly scribbled an\naddition to his patent in the margin, adding that it should also cover\n\u201ctransmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\u201d (this addition does\nnot appear in any of the other copies).\n\nContravening much standard practice at the time, Bell\u2019s (modified)\npatent was quickly granted, while Gray\u2019s was denied. It was issued the\nsame day Bell returned home from DC, March 7, 1876. The following day,\nBell drew in his lab notebook a copy of the diagram he had seen in\nElisha Gray\u2019s patent:\n\n![Diagram showing the similarity between Gray's patent and Bell's\nnotebook](image1_truetelephone)\n\nIt took Bell several days of tinkering, but soon he was able to\nreplicate Gray\u2019s device. On March 10, he made that now-famous call:\n\u201cWatson \u2014 come here \u2014 I want to see you.\u201d Both Bell and his assistant\nWatson recorded the event that night in their notebooks.\n\nBut Bell didn\u2019t want to simply duplicate Gray\u2019s work; he wanted to\ninvent a telephone of his own. He spent many months trying to develop a\ntelephone that worked on a different principle, but never succeeded in\ngetting it to clearly transmit audible speech. Bell was always\nextraordinarily reluctant to demonstrate his telephone, for fear that\nGray would learn it was a simple copy. Mabel had to trick him into\nattending the Centennial Exposition, where he was supposed to\ndemonstrate his work to a group of engineers, including Elisha Gray. On\none occasion, Bell\u2019s telephone patent was set to be annulled unless Bell\nwould swear under oath that the invention was truly his. Bell fled the\ncountry, testifying only at the last minute after desperate pleading\nfrom Mabel.\n\nThe legal conniving a success, Bell and Mabel were soon married. Feeling\nguilty, Bell gave all but ten of his shares in the Bell Telephone\nCompany to her and swore to never work in telephony again. The company\nwas operated by Gardiner and others while Bell went back to working with\nthe deaf. He always said he was more proud of his work for the deaf than\nof the telephone.\n\nIt took Gray a long time to realize that Bell\u2019s patent was a fraud. For\none thing, he was still focused on the harmonic telegraph; his customers\nat Western Union couldn\u2019t imagine running telephone wires to every house\nand thus couldn\u2019t see how talking over wires was particularly useful.\nFor another, it took years for the story to leak out, through numerous\ncourt battles and Congressional hearings. [Zenas Fisk Wilber\u2019s\naffidavit](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Zenas-fisk-wilber-affidavit.png)\nconfessing to what he\u2019d done did not appear until 1886, a decade later.\nBell\u2019s notebooks, making clear the blatant copy, were not made public\nuntil the *1990s*.\n\nBell\u2019s biographers have gone to heroic lengths to explain away all the\nevidence. Refusing credit for the telephone just showed Bell\u2019s humility;\nnot being involved in the corporation showed his dedication to pure\nresearch. The fact that both patents were filed on the same day is a\ngrand historic coincidence \u2014 or perhaps *Gray* stole the idea from Bell.\n\nAs a result, Gray is forgotten and Bell is remembered as one of\nhistory\u2019s great inventors \u2014 not as he should be: a hobbyist and a fraud,\nforced by love into stealing one of the greatest inventions of all time.\n\n*Now playing: Regina Spector - \u201cOn The Radio\u201d*\n\n[image1_truetelephone]: image1_truetelephone.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/039333368X", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Zenas-fisk-wilber-affidavit.png"], "time": 1231142400.0, "postid": "truetelephone", "internal_links": []}, "simon": {"post_title": "Simon Arrives", "tags": [], "post_content": "Simon Arrives\n=============\n\nJuly 26, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/simon)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWednesday, June 22\n\nI originally made a short-term reservation at Simmons Hall, both because\nI had to get authorization for a longer-term stay and because I wasn\u2019t\nsure if I\u2019d like it. I\u2019ve already extended it once, but it expires\ntomorrow, when my partner arrives (he also needs a room). I email the\nhouse manager about staying. He says I should stop by. I go to his\noffice. He\u2019s not there. I try back later, he\u2019s talking to someone. And\nso it goes throughout the day until he leaves. Uh oh.\n\nI email him. He gives me a firm appointment in the morning. He can\nextend my room through the end of the summer. \u2018Thanks,\u2019 I say. \u2018Alright\nthen?\u2019 \u2018Actually, I have a friend and I was sort of wondering if he\ncould stay here too\u2026\u2019 \u2018Oh, hmm, well, I need to keep a certain number of\nrooms reserved just in case anything goes wrong, you know. I think we\u2019re\npretty much out.\u2019 \u2018But what about that room next door to me? Nobody\nseems to be living there.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a double, not a single.\u2019 \u2018Oh.\u2019\n\n\u2018Actually, how about this?\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ll let you move into that room\nand you can split it with your friend. How does that sound?\u2019 This\nSolomonic compromise is better than sleeping on the street or something,\nso I agree. He marks me down in his book and gets me the key from the\ndesk. I move all my stuff over to the new room, which is like three\ntimes as big as my old room, and nicely laid out too. I return the key\nto the old room (stupidly, I guess) but I keep the door propped open so\nwe can use it if we need some alone-time. (Which indeed I do until my\npartner gets us all locked out from it forever the first time he uses\nit. Afterwards, I switch to using the time machine.)\n\nAt around 7:30pm there comes a knock at the door \u2014 my first here. I open\nit and there\u2019s a strange man I don\u2019t recognize with a suitcase. \u2018You\nmust be Aaron,\u2019 he says. \u2018Hi,\u2019 I say. \u2018I\u2019ve got some good news and some\nbad news. The good news is I cut our housing costs in half.\u2019 \u2018Wow, how\u2019d\nyou do that?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Well, the bad news is it\u2019s because we\u2019re sharing\none room,\u2019 I say and open the door onto our double. \u2018Oh,\u2019 he says, a\nlittle scared.\n\nDespite this humor routine, I\u2019m a little scared too. Watching this\nstrange person move into my room is more than a little odd. I\u2019ve always\nbeen afraid of sharing space with other people. I almost thought of\ndropping out of college if I had to share a room. At least this is only\nfor the summer. But it still seems odd. What was I thinking when I chose\nto spend the summer with a random person based on little more than an\nemail and a flicker of name recognition. I didn\u2019t even check references,\ndespite knowing one of the references. Why was I so stupid? I make a\nnote to check with that reference (which I never do).\n\nDespite all this, it works amazingly well. Simon likes asking questions\nand I like explaining things. We both enjoy our privacy and end up on\nroughly similar schedules. Simon is a good, if not great programmer and\nvery open to being convinced he\u2019s doing things wrong. In fact, Simon is\nvery open to anything. So open, in fact, that his openness is\npractically the only frustrating bit about him. I can say the meanest\nthings to his face and he\u2019ll just laugh and agree.\n\nOur first big debate is about planning. Simon wonders why we aren\u2019t\ndoing more planning. Shouldn\u2019t we do use cases and draw up screenshots\nand make a list of features and pick milestones and build a mockup\nfirst? \u2018Nah,\u2019 I say. \u2018Let\u2019s just build it.\u2019 This goes against what Simon\nhas been taught. \u2018Planning,\u2019 I say, \u2018makes sense when you\u2019re solving a\npredefined problem or working for somebody who is defining the problem\nfor you. But it doesn\u2019t make sense when you\u2019re hacking. When you\u2019re\nhacking, as Paul Graham likes to note, you\u2019re actually figuring out what\nthe problem is, exploring the problem space. It\u2019s through writing the\ncode that you figure out what the code should do. You can\u2019t plan that.\u2019\nSimon eventually comes to agree, although it takes him a while to get\nrid of his instincts.\n\nEven afterwards, he is still tempted to overbuild things. We needed a\npermissions system, for example, and Simon build a super-advanced,\ncompletely generalized database model for one so complicated that it\ntook up several pages of code. I spent a week trying to fix it up and\nimplement it before finally giving up, saying it was just too\ncomplicated for me to wrap my head around. But he\u2019s working on it.\n\nI, meanwhile, have been struggling with my own demons \u2014 mainly\nprocrastination. Programming is an odd task in that it requires so much\nmental discipline that your mind is often afraid of doing it. Worse\nstill is the fact that it happens at a computer, usually one with an\nInternet connection, so there\u2019s hardly any visible difference between\nactually doing your work and running off to check your email or read the\nnews. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to snap out of a bit of newsreading\nand realize you just wasted a couple of hours.\n\nTo combat this problem, I brought back an old application I wrote:\nminuteminder. minuteminder unobtrusively pops up in the corner of your\nscreen every five minutes. When you get a second you can click on it and\ntell it what you\u2019re doing and it\u2019ll log that with the current time and\ngo back and hide. The idea is that the combination of telling the\ncomputer you\u2019re really surfing the Web and seeing that you\u2019ve been doing\nso for the past 20 minutes will jolt you into waking up and heading back\nto something more productive. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but I think\nit definitely helps a lot.

Since I\u2019ll probably never get around to\nwriting such a book, I figured I\u2019d just write up such examples on my\nblog when I encountered them and maybe someone else would take the idea\nand run with it.\n\nSo here\u2019s the first example:\n\nIt\u2019s 8pm, and you settle down in front of the television to watch\n*American Idol*. Unfortunately, at the very same time your roommate is\nalso settling down in front of the television to play one of his video\ngames. Quickly, the two of you get into a tiff about who will get to use\nthe television first. You both would prefer using the television first\nrather than second, yet, since *American Idol* is a live show, watching\nit now is a rather different experience from watching it later, while\nthe video game will remain the same all night. How can you prove\nmathematically to your roommate that you should get to use the\ntelevision first?\n\nLet U(TV\\_0 = A), which we\u2019ll write AT0, represent the number of\n*utiles* (essentially, a measure of enjoyment) you get from watching the\nTV first, while BT0 represents the number of utiles your roommate gets\nfrom watching the TV first. (AT1 and BT1 represent the utiles from\nwatching it second.) Obviously our goal is to maximize the total number\nof utiles (i.e. enjoyment) in the world, by picking the solution that\nleads to our greatest number.\n\nFirst we write down what we know. Obviously you both would prefer to\nwatch the show first, rather than second:\n\nAT0 \\> AT1\\\n BT0 \\> BT1\n\nBut since *Amereican Idol* is live, we can also say that the benefit you\nget from watching it first is bigger than the benefit your roommate gets\nfrom playing his game first. In other words:\n\nAT0 - AT1 \\> BT0 - BT1\n\nFinally, we want to find out which is bigger: you going first and him\nsecond, or you going second and him first. Let \\>\\< represent \u201cwhich is\nbigger?\u201d\n\nAT0 + BT1 \\>\\< AT1 + BT0\n\nNow, to solve, we take what we know:\n\nAT0 - AT1 \\> BT0 - BT1\n\nAnd we add AT1 to both sides:\n\nAT0 \\> BT0 - BT1 + AT1\n\nAnd then add BT1 to both sides:\n\nAT0 + BT1 \\> BT0 + AT1\n\nWhich precisely answers are question above: it\u2019s better for you to go\nfirst.\n\nBy this time in the proof, however, your roommate should have wandered\noff, leaving you to watch *American Idol* in peace. Unfortunately, not\nhaving seen your proof, he thinks you\u2019re just a selfish ass as opposed\nto trying hard to do what\u2019s best for the whole world.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1219561200.0, "postid": "everydayutil", "internal_links": []}, "backup2009": {"post_title": "A Backup Solution?", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Backup Solution?\n==================\n\nJanuary 3, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/backup2009)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor years I\u2019ve wanted a backup solution that just works.

They give a grab\nbag of peculiar examples such as how people can be arrested for smoking\ndrugs, [not paying\ndebts](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/more-on-debtors-prisons.html),\nand, once in prison, can be [forbidden from reading\nbooks](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/solitary-confinement.html),\nand more.\n\nIn other words, the MRers have discovered that the most basic\ngovernments are sovereign which means that citizens can be put in jail\nfor just about any reason. Simply put, an government can arrest you if\nthey don\u2019t like you. This is a surprise?\n\nThe MRers do not adequately acknowledge that citizens have the same\nrights as politicians. Citizens can leave the country for any reason and\nthey can refuse to enter any country. If you don\u2019t like the politices of\nthe United States, or Australia or Venezuela you don\u2019t have to live\nthere or even visit. Indeed, citizens have more rights than politicians\nsince citizens are not subject to judicial review; that is, politicians\nare typically prohibited from passing laws against certain political\nviewpoints but citizens are not prohibited from only entering countries\nwhere those viewpoints are marginal.\n\nIf you think that the freedom to leave is without value, bear in mind\nthat under dictatorships and totalitarian states governments could\nprevent citizens from leaving and from moving. The freedom to leave was\nhard won. We should not disparage the liberation brought by the right to\nexit.\n\nTurning to the economics, the MRers are so outraged by an government\u2019s\nlegal possibilities that they fail to notice that most governments do\nnot in fact arrest people for smoking drugs or for failing to pay debts.\nWhy not? The reason is that these rights are often more valuable to the\ncitizen than to the politician and thus both citizen and politician can\nbe made better off if the citizen keeps the rights. If the politician\nvalues the right more than the citizen then the politician buys the\nright with lower taxes or less regulation in other areas. If the citizen\nvalues the right more than the politician then the citizen retains the\nright at an otherwise higher tax rate. The politician gets the right\nonly when the politician pays.\n\nThis is not to say that abuses do not occur, they do, as in all\nrelationships and on both sides, but the MRers lump abuses and mutually\nprofitable exchanges together\u2013that\u2019s dangerous because in regulating\nabuses it is very easy to do away with mutually profitable exchanges.\n\nThe greater the productivity of citizens and the higher their incomes\nthe less citizens will be willing to sell rights for lower taxes (i.e.\nthe more willing they will be to pay for better regulatory conditions).\nCitizens gain more autonomy as they and their society become more\nproductive. Thus, the best protector of citizen autonomy is high\nproductivity and economic growth.\n\nTo understand freedom and true coercion let us remember that American\ncitizens have the freedom to leave and visit other countries, a freedom\nthat gun, barbed wire and electrified fence deny to many millions of\nless fortunate citizens from around the world.\n", "external_links": ["http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/libertarianism-and-the-workplace-ii.html", "http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/more-on-debtors-prisons.html", "http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/solitary-confinement.html"], "time": 1341558000.0, "postid": "tabarroklibertarianism", "internal_links": []}, "wassup": {"post_title": "Wassup?", "tags": ["projects"], "post_content": "Wassup?\n=======\n\nMarch 27, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/wassup)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWow, it\u2019s been a long time since we last talked. In fairness, I\u2019ve been\nhard at work. As you probably know, for a long time I\u2019ve been working on\na startup called [infogami](http://infogami.com/). If you\u2019re interested\nin the full story, [I\u2019ve written a long blog post about\nit](http://infogami.com/blog/introduction) but in short, last November I\njoined the amazing team behind [reddit](http://reddit.com/), merging our\ntwo companies.\n\nThen, about a month ago, I quietly released the first version of\n[infogami](http://infogami.com/) to the public. It was a very early\nversion with hardly any features and I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it, but\nwe still got several thousand sites created using the software.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve kept my promise of releasing a new feature every day,\nsteadily improving the site bit by bit. There are a couple things I\u2019m\nparticularly proud of, including our advanced permissions system which\ngives detailed control over exactly who can do what with your site and\n[the blame feature](http://infogami.com/blog/blame) that was put\ntogether by my friends Zack Coburn and Sean B. Palmer which shows\nexactly who wrote what in a document. And of course there\u2019s much more to\ncome.\n\nOf course, working on just one project all the time is a little much, so\nI\u2019ve been taking little breaks to work on new hacks. This weekend I\nbuilt a little site called (for now, at least) [Simple\nAmazon](http://books.theinfo.org/). I was annoyed with how slow it was\nto search Amazon \u2014 first you have to load their complicated front page,\ntype in your search in the tiny hidden box, then click the link to\nfilter it just for books and so on. With Simple Amazon, you just go to a\nURL like:\n\n[http://books.theinfo.org/lisp](http://books.theinfo.org/lisp)\n\nand you get a listing of lisp books superfast with covers and links to\nprice checks. You can also use links like:\n\n[http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262011530](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262011530)\n\nto provide shorter links to Amazon.\n\nAnyway, I guess that\u2019s about it for now. If you\u2019re interested in\nfollowing my more day-to-day work, I\u2019m publishing company-related stuff\nover on the [infogami blog](http://infogami.com/blog/).

Byssinosis, also called Brown Lung Disease, is when\nyour lungs fill up with cotton dust. Eventually your throat closes up\nand you suffocate to death. The company insists the whole thing is a\nstunt made up by Ralph Nader and other liberal do-gooders. But one day\nthey change their tune:\n\n> Weft, as well as all the other large and medium-sized American textile\n> companies, was actually addressing the cotton dust problem, but in a\n> characteristically indirect way. As part of a larger modernization\n> effort, the firm invested \\$20 million in a few plants where\n> executives knew such an investment would make money. \u2026 The investment\n> had the side benefit of reducing cotton dust levels \u2026 One manager who\n> was in charge of the project \u2026 comments on whether dust control was a\n> principal factor in the decision\u2026:\n>\n> > No, definitely not. Would any sane, rational man spend \\$15 million\n> > for a 2 percent return? \u2026 Now it does improve the dust levels, but\n> > it was that if we don\u2019t invest the money now, we would be in a\n> > desperate [competitive] position fifteen years from now. \u2026 It was on\n> > these bases that the decision was made.\n>\n> Publicly, of course, Weft Corporation, as do many other firms, claims\n> that the money was spent entirely to eliminate dust, evidence of its\n> corporate good citizenship. Privately, executives admit that without\n> the productive return, they would not have\u2014indeed, given the\n> constraints under which they operate\u2014could not have spent the money.\n> And they have not done so in several other plants and only with great\n> reluctance, if at all, in sections of otherwise renovated plants where\n> it is more difficult to \u2026 achieve simultaneous cost and dust\n> reduction.\n\n(Robert Jackall, *Moral Mazes*, 158f)\n\nWhat does Jackall mean that the executives \u201ccould not have spent the\nmoney \u2026 given the constraints under which they operate\u201d? Another story\nin the book about the chemical corporation Alchemy illustrates his\npoint:\n\n> Consider, for instance, the case of a large coking plant of the\n> chemical company. [Coking is a chemical process for distilling coal.]\n> Coke making requires a giant battery to cook the coke slowly and\n> evenly for long periods; the battery is the most significant piece of\n> capital equipment in a coking plant. In 1975, the plant\u2019s battery\n> showed signs of weakening and certain managers at corporate\n> headquarters had to decide whether to invest \\$6 million to restore\n> the battery to top form. Clearly, because of the amount of money\n> involved, this was a gut decision.\n>\n> No decision was made. The CEO had sent the word out to defer all the\n> unnecessary capital expenditures to give the corporation cash reserves\n> for other investments. So the managers allocated small amounts of\n> money to patch the battery up until 1979, when it collapsed entirely.\n> This brought the company into breach of contract with a steel producer\n> and into violation of various Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n> pollution regulations. The total bill, including lawsuits and now\n> federally mandated repairs to the battery, exceeded \\$100 million. I\n> have heard figures as high as \\$150 million, but because of \u201ccreative\n> accounting,\u201d no one is sure of the exact amount.\n>\n> This simple but very typical example gets to the heart of how decision\n> making was intertwined with a company\u2019s authority structure and\n> advancement patterns. \u2026 Had they acted decisively in 1975\u2014in\n> hindsight, the only substantively rational choice\u2014they would have\n> salvaged the battery and saved their company millions of dollars in\n> the long run.\n>\n> In the short run, however, \u2026. they would have been taking serious\n> personal risks in restoring the battery. \u2026 their political networks\n> might have unraveled, leaving them vulnerable to attack. \u2026 A manager\n> at Weft Corporation reflects:\n>\n> > People are always calculating how others will see the decisions they\n> > make. \u2026 They know that they have to gauge not just the external \u2026\n> > market consequences of a decision, but the internal political\n> > consequences. And sometimes you can make the right market decision,\n> > but it can be the wrong political decision.\n\n(*Mazes*, 81-84)\n\nHad the manager in charge of the plant with the ailing battery done the\nreplacement, his department would be six million dollars less\nprofitable. When it came time to compare managers for the next\npromotion, he would seem massively less efficient than the guy running\nthe plant next door. He\u2019d be passed by and his corporate ascendency\nwould be over.\n\nCorporate managers simply aren\u2019t allowed to be moral, or even\nreasonable. And those who try are simply weeded out. Not only does the\nmanager who replaced the battery get passed over for the job; the\nmanager who was obedient enough not to gets promoted to a more powerful\nposition.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1165824000.0, "postid": "bizethics", "internal_links": []}, "sevenhabits": {"post_title": "Seven Habits of Highly Successful Websites", "tags": [], "post_content": "Seven Habits of Highly Successful Websites\n==========================================\n\nDecember 12, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/sevenhabits)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI got a phone call from my father the other day. \u201cOh,\u201d I thought\nimmediately, \u201che\u2019s probably calling to finally apologize for failing to\nattend that basketball game I played at in fourth grade.\u201d But no, I was\nonce again wrong. He was calling to pitch his web startup.\n\nThey\u2019re at the racquetball court, the grocery store, the venture\ncapitalists\u2019 offices \u2014 you can\u2019t avoid this new crowd of so-called \u201cWeb\n2.0\u201d startups. And every time they meet you, if they\u2019re not asking for\nangel funding, they\u2019re asking for suggestions on how they should run\ntheir company.\n\nFor a long time, I\u2019d simply tell them they should ask a real expert,\nlike Dr. Paulson Graham of the Institute of Advances Startup Studies,\nbut the number of queries has become so great that I\u2019ve decided to\nconduct some research of my own.\n\nI picked out seven recent extremely popular websites. While perhaps not\nhaving the mindshare of a \u201cBasecamp\u201d or a \u201cNing\u201d, these websites do have\nthe benefit of having tons of actual users. Here they are, ranked\nroughly in order of popularity:\n\n-   MySpace\n-   Wikipedia (basically tied)\n-   Facebook\n-   Flickr (pronounced flick-her)\n-   Digg\n-   Del.icio.us (pronounced dell-dot-icky-oh-dot-you-ess)\n-   Google Maps (no popularity data available but I bet it\u2019s pretty\n    popular)\n\nI looked at all these websites to see what they have in common. Here\u2019s\nwhat I discovered.\n\nBe Ugly\n-------\n\nWith the single exception of Flickr, all these websites are hideous.\nFacebook and Wikipedia redesigned late in the game, upgrading their web\ndesign from \u201chideous\u201d to \u201cbarely tolerable\u201d, but MySpace has continued\non, its name becoming synonymous with design so atrocious it has\nactually been known to induce vomiting in epileptic Japanese children.\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s the most popular site on the list.\n\nUnlike most of Google, Google Maps actually isn\u2019t such a bad looking\nwebsite in itself, but most of its Web 2.0 \u201ccred\u201d comes from its ability\nto make \u201cmashups\u201d in which people stick a Google Map with several\nhundred thousand different little red blurble icons sticking all over it\nonto a webpage whose design sense can best be described as \u201cMySpace\nknockoff\u201d. Normally I don\u2019t go in for guilt by association, but in this\ncase I think it\u2019s deserved.\n\nDel.icio.us and Digg both attempted redesigns at one point but due to a\ntragic mixup in communication, the web design teams they hired misheard\ntheir instructions and thought their job was actually to try to make the\nsite look *worse* instead of better. Having blown several thousand\ndollars of their VC\u2019s money on this enterprise, they had no choice but\nto launch the resulting look.\n\nDon\u2019t Have Features\n-------------------\n\nLet\u2019s start with MySpace. Again, just as it\u2019s a leader in traffic, it\u2019s\na leader in this category. MySpace has so few features, I don\u2019t even\nknow what it does. Neither, apparently, do its users, who in fact create\nMySpace accounts simply to impress their friends and annoy their\nteachers. (Personal communication)\n\nThe last time Wikipedia added a substantive new feature was the addition\nof categories a couple years ago and, frankly, that was a pretty bad\nidea because it was so poorly implemented. Otherwise it\u2019s basically just\nbeen a big box you edit text in with a bunch of kluges on top. That\u2019s\nhow it got to be number two.\n\nFacebook, Flickr, and Digg all add features occasionally, but they\u2019re\nmore than counteracted by Del.icio.us and Google Maps, which in fact\nhave actively taken features away. Del.icio.us decided that tag\nintersections (finding links that are tagged with two words) was just\ntoo hard to get back online after they were purchased by Yahoo! and so\nthey simply took the feature down without notice. The site spiked in\npopularity until they added them back the other day and traffic went\ndown once again.\n\nGoogle Maps, meanwhile, has just removed everything else from the page\nexcept for the map and the search box, ensuring no features get in\nbetween the user and their mapping experience. Like most Google\nsoftware, though, features are definitely not going to be *added*.\n\nLet Users Do Your Job\n---------------------\n\nNone of the content on any of these sites is provided by the people who\nmade the site. In every case, the content is provided by the users. The\nonly exception is Google Maps, where the content is provided NAVTEQ.\n\nCombined with the last principle, you might begin to suspect that this\nis simply because the developers of these sites are extremely lazy. But\nI don\u2019t believe that; I think there\u2019s a more complicated principle at\nwork.\n\nI believe in a theory I\u2019ll call \u201cThe Stupidity of Crowds\u201d. Here\u2019s the\nbasic idea: if just one person or a small group of people builds a\nwebsite, they have to be at least moderately intelligent. Buying servers\nand writing programs is somewhat hard and takes a little bit of\nbrainpower. This means that the content for their site will be similarly\nintelligent and thus it won\u2019t be of interest to the vast majority of\nInternet users.\n\nThe glorious thing about the Internet, however, is that it allows us to\naggregate the combined stupidity of literally *millions* of people. No\nlonger do you have to try to play towards the lowest common denominator\n\u2014 now you can actually have the lowest common denominator build your\nsite for you. No single mortal could possibly come up with the content\nyou find on the average MySpace, let alone the hideous color scheme,\ngarish backgrounds, and awful auto-playing background music. No,\nsomething like that takes The Stupidity of Crowds.\n\nIgnore Standards\n----------------\n\nLike 99.999999% of all websites on the Internet, none of these websites\nsupports web standards, the documents that explain the proper way to use\nthe Web. Enough said.\n\nBuild to Flip\n-------------\n\nMySpace, Flickr, Del.icio.us, and Google Maps all sold out to larger\ncompanies. (Google Maps didn\u2019t even launch until after it was acquired.)\nWikipedia is apparently some sort bizarre legal construction called a\n\u201cdonation-funded non-profit\u201d and this apparently has made it hard to\nsell. (Note to future founders: make sure not to incorporate your\ncompany as one of these as it can severely hamper your options later\non.)\n\nFacebook and Digg haven\u2019t sold out yet, but I bet they want to. (Another\ntip: taking large quantities of VC money also makes it hard to sell your\ncompany, both because it gives you a swelled head but also because it\ngives the VCs control over when you can sell, and their heads are\n*really* big.)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1165910400.0, "postid": "sevenhabits", "internal_links": []}, "thesecretsecret": {"post_title": "The Secret Behind The Secret", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Secret Behind The Secret\n============================\n\nMarch 26, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thesecretsecret)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe \\#1 bestselling book in America is a 216-page volume called *The\nSecret*, based on a DVD of the same title. \u201cTruly life-changing\ninformation,\u201d exclaims the publisher on Amazon.com. \u201cA new era for\nhumankind,\u201d exults the web site. \u201cThis is The Secret to everything \u2014 the\nsecret to unlimited joy, health, money, relationships, love, youth:\neverything you have ever wanted.

Namely, that the universe is governed by\na heretofore unknown Law of Attraction, as yet undiscovered by\nconventional physicists, that the world rearranges itself to conform to\nyour thoughts. Or, as one proponent put it, the universe \u201cis akin to a\nbig mail-order department,\u201d in which you \u201c\u2018order\u2019 what you get by\nsending energetic messages out to the universe.\u201d\n\nThis stuff is so blatantly absurd that it\u2019s not really worth debunking.\nAnd it\u2019s silly enough that [Barbara Ehrenreich has already written the\ndefinitive\nmockery](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DF113CF937A2575BC0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all)\n(\u201cThoughts exert a gravitational-type force on the world, so that\n\u2018whenever you think something, the thought immediately attracts its\nphysical equivalent.\u2019 If you think money \u2014 in a totally urgent, focused\nand positive way, of course \u2014 it will come flying into your pockets.\u201d).\n[Twice](http://ehrenreich.blogs.com/barbaras_blog/2007/02/the_secret_of_m.html)\n(\u201cI don\u2019t have to write this blog, I can simply visualize it already\nwritten \u2014 or could, if I\u2019d bothered to read the whole book and finish\nthe DVD.\u201d)\n\nBut, drawing on some of Ehrenreich\u2019s other work, I\u2019d like to discuss\nthey *why* of this book. The book\u2019s success is easy enough to explain.\nAs [the Canadian publisher put\nit](http://www.thestar.com/article/193263) in an interview with the\n*Toronto Star*, \u201cBasically, human beings are lazy. If you tell them you\ncan get rich just by thinking about it, obviously, they\u2019re going to buy\nit.\u201d\n\nBut these books also have a more insidious effect. As Ehrenreich notes,\nby making your lack of wealth and a good job into personal problems, you\ndiscourage people from looking at the social systems that created and\nsustained those problems. By telling them their thoughts control the\nuniverse, you can persuade them to do things like \u2014 as one\nSecret-endorsing book encouraged \u2014 \u201cPlace your hand on your heart and\nsay \u2026 \u2018I admire rich people!\u2019 \u2018I bless rich people!\u2019 \u2018I love rich\npeople!\u2019 \u2018And I\u2019m going to be one of those rich people too!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd, in reverse, by telling people that bad things are caused by their\nnegative thoughts, you get to persuade them to stop thinking about bad\nthings. \u201cI\u2019m a really big believer in The Secret,\u201d a young black woman\nrecently explained at a Secret-related book reading. \u201cBut I also believe\nthat discrimination and racism are real. How can you harmonize those\nthings?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just said you believe in discrimination,\u201d explained the guru. \u201cYou\nbe-*live* it. I\u2019m going to ask you to stop believing it, because if you\nfocus on the negative, you project it yourself.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 if you stop believing in the existence of discrimination,\nit\u2019ll stop happening to you. No need to fight to end it! Those black\npeople banned from lunch counters in the South? They weren\u2019t simply\nbelieving hard enough. Those studies showing that resumes with\nblack-sounding names on them received far fewer callbacks as identical\nones with white-sounding names? The researchers didn\u2019t take into account\ntheir thoughtwaves.\n\nFollowing this idea goes to some pretty dark places and the authors take\nit all the way. \u201cI really love what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said a young man at\nthe same event. \u201cBut how, for example, was 9/11 attracted to the people\nin those buildings? That\u2019s something I can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, we experience the law of attraction collectively,\u201d explains\nthe guru. \u201cThe US maybe had a fear of being attacked.

For lack of a\nbetter term, let\u2019s call it *the percentage fallacy*. The idea is simple:\n\n> One day I find I need a blender. I see a particularly nice one at the\n> store for \\$40, so I purchase it and head home. But on the way home, I\n> see the exact same blender on sale at a different store for \\$20. Now\n> I feel ripped off, so I drive back to the first store, return the\n> blender, drive back to the second store, and buy it for \\$20.\n>\n> The next day I find I need a laptop. I see a particularly nice one at\n> the store for \\$2500, so I purchase it and head home. But on the way\n> home, I see the exact same laptop for \\$2480. \u201cPff, well, it\u2019s only\n> \\$20,\u201d I say, and continue home with the original laptop.\n\nI\u2019m sure all of you have done something similar \u2014 maybe the issue wasn\u2019t\nhaving to return something, but spending more time looking for a cheaper\nmodel, or fiddling with coupons and rebates, or buying something of\ninferior quality. But the basic point is consistent: we\u2019ll do things to\nsave 50% that we\u2019d never do to save 1%.\n\nAt first this almost seems rational \u2014 of course we\u2019re going to do more\nto save more money! But you *aren\u2019t* saving more money. With both the\nblender and the laptop, you have the chance to save \\$20. Either way,\nyou\u2019re going to have another twenty in your pocket, which you can spend\non exactly the same things later on. Yet we behave differently depending\non whether we got that twenty by skimping on a small purchase or\nskimping on a big one. Rationally, if driving back to the store isn\u2019t\nworth \\$20 when you\u2019re buying a laptop, it isn\u2019t worth \\$20 when you\u2019re\nbuying a blender.\n\nOn the other hand, don\u2019t those small savings tend to add up after a\nwhile? If you start blowing \\$20 every time you buy a trinket, you\u2019re\nsoon going to be out of disposable income. Meanwhile, spending several\nthousand dollars is much rarer, so isn\u2019t it OK to slack off a bit on\nsuch occasions?\n\nIf we work to save 50% on everything, big or small, that\u2019s the\nequivalent of saving 50% of our money altogether. Whereas if we only try\nto save fixed amounts on every purchase, how much we save is dependent\non how many things we buy.\n\nSo which is the real irrationality? I\u2019m not entirely sure of the answer.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1216623600.0, "postid": "percentagefallacy", "internal_links": []}, "saipan": {"post_title": "A Saipan Story", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Saipan Story\n==============\n\nSeptember 14, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/saipan)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*The following is fiction. Violent, explicit fiction. However, while the\ncharacters are fictional, the setting is entirely real.*\n\nJason wakes up in an elegant DC apartment, sunlight streaming in through\nthe picture windows and making the white walls gleam. He brushes his\nteeth and showers, before putting on his customary white-collared shirt.\nOnly today he isn\u2019t going to the office. Instead, a hired car waits\noutside to take him to the airport, where he\u2019ll be travelling (first\nclass, of course) to Saipan, that grand \u201claboratory of liberty\u201d he\u2019s\nknown so much about, and on which he is due to write an article for some\nconservative magazine or other (his employers will place it).\n\nHe begins the piece in the car: a small island off the coast of Japan,\nSaipan was made an American protectorate after World War II. Only its\nunique agreement allows it to ignore many US laws, making it as close to\na free-market paradise as could be imagined: a guest-worker program, low\ntaxes, and no meddlesome industry regulation. A tropical paradise\nindeed. The thrill of the idea sustains him through the day\u2019s journey.\n\nMeeting him at the airport is Jack Abramoff, the conservative hero who\nset up this Saipan tour program, and a bunch of other, mostly older,\nfaces he vaguely recognizes from around the capitol. Abramoff runs such\ntours regularly, helping spread the word among his tribe of this\nall-too-little known conservative success story.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTriana awoke in a Philippines shantytown, ramshackle huts spread amongst\nopen-air markets. She had heard whispers of a better life out there and\nwhen, one day, a man offered to take her to America, she eagerly\naccepted. She was crammed in with a boatload of others for a packed\njourney to the far-off land. But soon enough they arrived and her hosts\nshowed them all to their barracks, accommodations they\u2019d obligingly\nprovided.\n\nAs they were taken to their quarters, she breathed in deep the tropical\nair. \u201cAhh, the smell of America,\u201d she exclaimed. She heard a laugh from\nsomeone behind her. \u201cAmerica?\u201d he chuckled. \u201cWelcome to Saipan.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nJason steps off the plane into a tropical paradise, full of verdant palm\ntrees, golden beaches, and a dazzling sunset. Abramoff shows them to\ntheir elegant hotel ([complete with private\nbeach](http://saipan.regency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/gallery/photos.jsp?hotelId=83&start=1))\nand invites them to meet him back in the lobby for the official tour the\nnext morning. Jason changes into his bathing suit and goes for a quick\nswim, before tucking himself into his lusciously-outfitted bed.\n\nThe next morning, Abramoff begins the tour with eighteen holes of golf,\ncarved into a cliff overseen by the mountains and overlooking a fabulous\nbay. As they play, Abramoff catches up on their stories and dazzles them\nwith tales of Saipan\u2019s splendor.\n\nThat night he provides a special treat \u2014 he takes them to the red-light\ndistrict, where incredibly-thin bikin-wearing girls cast mournful,\nsearching looks at the well-suited group of tourists. Jason smiles, but\nhe is almost taken aback by the hungry gleam in some of the older\nbusinessmen\u2019s eyes. One rotund White House official grabs two girls, one\non each arm, and drags them over to a pay-by-the-hour hotel. The others\nall go off looking for their fancy. \u201cWhat about you Abramoff?\u201d Jason\nasks. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve already got a girlfriend here,\u201d he winks. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll\nsee you guys tomorrow,\u201d he adds before heading off.\n\nJason shrugs his shoulders and heads toward a slender girl, apparently\nin her teens, with a kind smile on his face. The girl smiles widely\nback.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThey were fenced in, Triana and the others, allowed only to shuffle\nbetween the barracks and the windowless, exit-barred factory. If they\ndisobeyed, they would be deported immediately, all their possessions\nconfiscated. If they attempted to escape, the police would chase them\ndown and beat them. From then on, their life was to sew khakis for\nCalifornians, complete with the \u201cMade in the USA\u201d labels that give their\nfuture owners such comfort.\n\nThere were few comforts for Triana. Bathrooms whose access was strictly\ncontrolled and whose condition was so filthy that one was inclined to\navoid them altogether. Rations so tough one had to saw through them with\nthe plastic knife. And, of course, the constant, seething hum of sewing\nmachines in the semi-darkness.\n\nEach night, when they headed back to their barracks after their shift,\nthey were accosted by men, leaning against their cars and flashing\ndollar bills. \u201cCome on, just a little something?\u201d one might call. \u201cLet\nme show you a good time,\u201d another might add. The factory does not pay\ncash, so the only way for Triana to make some money is to crawl under\ntheir steering wheels and extend her tongue.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next day, Abramoff takes to meet the local pwoer-players. Factory\nowners gush about the island\u2019s incredible economic growth, and\npoliticians (many of whom got their start as humble factory owners),\nwarn them about the Federal Government\u2019s imperialist (and racist)\ninterference with their local way of life. \u201cThey want to shut us down,\u201d\none insists. \u201cThe leftists can\u2019t stand to have us proving that the free\nmarket works!\u201d Even the island\u2019s Democrats have seen the light, signing\non to plans for school vouchers, low taxes, and right-to-work laws.\n\nThey close off the day with a tour of a model factory. It is a clean and\nwell-lit place, and the employees he introduces them to all gush with\nthanks for their newfound prosperity in life. Afterwards, Abramoff takes\nthem deeper into the complex and invites them to take a factory girl\nhome for the night.\n\nJason is struck by one girl with dazzling eyes and is immediately\nsmitten. \u201cJason,\u201d he says, extending his hand. \u201cTriana,\u201d she replies.\nShe speaks little English, but Jason is satisfied to spend the whole\ntrip back simply staring into her eyes.\n\nBack in his hotel room, he eagerly tears off her clothes and begins\ncaressing her naked body, slowly removing his garments as well. He flips\nher over and lifts her up onto all fours, slipping on a condom before\nsliding into her from behind. Triana moans with his thrusts and he\nthinks about the power he has here, able to instantly have any girl he\ndesires. His thrusts grow harder and soon he is knocking her skull into\nthe bed\u2019s headboard, which only makes him pump harder still. (Outside, a\ncleaning maid shakes her head at the noise.) Harder and harder he goes\nuntil, with a sickening crack, he comes, and collapses onto her back\nwith a thud.\n\nHe breathes in deep, but there\u2019s a strange smell. He opens his eyes to\nfind a line of blood running thru Triana\u2019s hair and down onto the blood.\n\u201cShit!\u201d he exclaims, and pulls out, his erection fading. He spins the\ngirl over and shakes her violently, but her body feels strangely limp.\nHe feels her pulse and she is gone. \u201cShit!\u201d he says again, only quieter\nthis time.\n\nHe is breathing heavily; he needs to focus, needs to think of a plan. He\nlooks around the room. A window! He wraps he girl up in the sheets, and\nhoists her over to it and tosses her out, making a quiet thud on the\nground below. Turning back to the bed, he notices more sheets stained\nwith blood. He tears them up and tosses them out too, covering the body.\nLuckily, however, the bed is so lusciously appointed that nothing has\ngotten through to the mattress and very little is on the headboard. He\nwipes it clean, showers the blood off himself, and takes a deep breath\nbefore heading for the front desk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to rent a car,\u201d he tells the concierge. \u201cOf course, sir,\u201d he\nreplies. Soon he is loading the bundle of limbs and sheets into the\ntrunk of an SUV and heading off down the coast. He finds a boat rental\nspot and manages to smuggle the body on board the craft. He ties on some\nballast for good measure and then takes it all some ways out into the\nocean, before pitching it overboard.\n\nBack in his hotel room (his bed having been quickly remade), he stares\nat his hands. He has murdered, he has taken a human life. And yet, he\nhas gotten away with it. The women here so eagerly give themselves up to\nbe used here, used and discarded, discarded like just another market\ngood. And nobody cares if they are gone \u2014 nobody cares about them at\nall. What power, to be able to control human life like that. What power,\nto be that kind of man.\n\nThat night, the sex is incredible.\n\n* * * * *\n\nUnfortunately, his island carouse is fast coming to an end. The next day\nAbramoff takes them back to the airport and quickly he finds himself\nback in his DC apartment, showering and putting on his white-collared\nshirt, before heading into the office. He finishes off his story on\nSaipan (\u201cMaybe we on the mainland can learn something about freedom from\nour far-flung island commonwealth,\u201d he\n[writes](http://www.heartland.org/policybot/results.html?artId=940).\n\u201cImagine: an island paradise where newcomers are welcomed and enterprise\nflourishes.\u201d) and sends it to his bosses. But even with the job\nfinished, he can\u2019t shake the island from his mind.\n\nHis life of white apartments and gray offices seems stale now, he longs\nfor a little excitement in his life. He heads to a Adams Morgan bar, but\nthe girls here are all involved in their own scenarios, with none of the\ncome-hither looks of those on the island. He nurses a beer at the bar,\ntrying to put the longing out of his mind. An attractive girl comes to\nthe bar, ordering drinks for her friends. As she scoops up the drinks\nand heads back, Jason calls out at her: \u201cHey there, can I get you\nanything?\u201d She turns around and stares at him, before turning back and\nwalking away.\n\nHe has to get back to Saipan.\n", "external_links": ["http://saipan.regency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/gallery/photos.jsp?hotelId=83&start=1", "http://www.heartland.org/policybot/results.html?artId=940"], "time": 1221375600.0, "postid": "saipan", "internal_links": []}, "socfunc": {"post_title": "Simplistic Sociological Functionalism", "tags": ["sociology"], "post_content": "Simplistic Sociological Functionalism\n=====================================\n\nMay 13, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/socfunc)\n\n* * * * *\n\n(I thought I should talk about the other form of functionalism for a\nchange.)\n\nOften sociologists notice a pattern in which certain attributes of a\nsocial system fits well with a particular social structure. To take an\nexample I have at hand, Rosabeth Moss Kanter notes that because a\nsecretary has access to facts that could embarrass her boss, it\u2019s\nconvenient for the boss that the secretary is entirely dependent upon\nhim for wages and status.\n\nUnfortunately, these claims are often phrased as saying X causes Y.\nHere\u2019s how Kanter does it:\n\n> The possibilities for blackmail inherent in [a secretary\u2019s] access \u2026\n> to the real story behind the boss\u2019s secrets \u2026 made it important that\n> she identify her interest as running with, rather than against, his.\n> Thus, forces were generated for the maintenance of a system in which\n> the secretary \u2026 was to find her status and reward level dependent on\n> the status and, hence, success of her boss. (*Men and Women of the\n> Corporation*, 82)\n\nNote that, although she is unusually careful to hedge her comments\n(\u201cmade it important\u201d, \u201cforces were generated\u201d, \u201cmaintenance of a\nsystem\u201d) Kanter is making a particular historical claim here: the\nsecretary could blackmail, which pushed the boss to tighten control. But\nthis is not the type of claim that Kanter, who\u2019s research consisted\nmostly of direct observation of present-day offices, is likely to have\nany real evidence for.\n\nMaking such claims is problematic, both because most sociologists don\u2019t\nreally know whether they are strictly true, and because they lead Jon\nElster to show up at your house and yell at you for hours. But both\nproblems can be easily avoided: simply rephrase such comments to\ndescribe the phenomena as *effects* rather than *causes*.\n\nInstead of saying a secretary\u2019s ability to blackmail leads bosses to\ntighten their grip, simply note that the boss\u2019s tight grip has the\neffect of weakening the secretary\u2019s ability to blackmail. You get all\nthe same points across and nobody gets hurt. See?

Its lit from\nunderneath, casting it an ominous glow, just the kind of comically-evil\nthing you\u2019d see in a bad movie.\n\nJust across the way is a childlike spaceship standing in front of a\nglowing dome and inside \u2014 well, inside, as a person at the desk put it\nin their thick German accent, \u201ceverything is a little bit chaos\u201d.\n\nThe Chaos Communications Congress has taken over the building. The dome\non the top floor is filled an ongoing series of interesting talks, the\nlounge underneath it is filled with couches and rugs and rocking music\nfor people to hang out, and the floor beneath that is filled with people\nin front of monitors watching the warm glow of computer code scroll by.\nThe place is filled with hackers.\n\nI don\u2019t particularly like computers, but there\u2019s a definite charm to\nthese people\u2019s cast of mind. They like to get stuff done. There are\ntables with soldering irons and pliers and lego blocks and cubes of\nblinking lights and animation software and magnifying glasses and more.\nOne group has built little blinking tags that figure out which room\nyou\u2019re in and report it to a central server. Another has shown everyone\nhow to purchase VOIP phones from the electronics store across the\nstreet, hook them up to a conference network they\u2019ve built, and then\nreturn them when the conference is over. Others are showing off the\nstuff they\u2019ve built, from software that can let you surf the Internet\ncompletely anonymously to laptops that can be distributed to the Third\nWorld for \\$100 a pop.\n\nFor these people, there\u2019s no separation between work and fun. It\u2019s not\nlike other conferences where you sit during the day in quiet seats\ntaking notes on carefully preselected talks and then spend the nights\nout drinking with your buddies. You can spend the days drinking and the\nnights listening to talks, each blending into each other, with games and\nworking and gabbing on the side. Couches next to lectures, couches in\nlectures, lectures from couches.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t like the subject matter, you have to admire the\natmosphere. What other group has a place like this, existing somewhere\nbetween occupation and hobby and subculture, between conference and\nconvention and hangout? It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s educational; it\u2019s occupation,\nit\u2019s friendship; it\u2019s building, it\u2019s destroying.

Our knowledge of how to make and cultivate communities is\nstill at a very early stage, but most agree on their importance.\n\nA magazine, we may imagine, is like a one-way web site. It doesn\u2019t\nreally allow the readers to talk back (with the small exception of the\nletters page), it doesn\u2019t even have any sort of interactivity. But I\nstill think communities are the key for magazines; the difference is\nthat magazines *export* communities.\n\nIn other words, instead of providing a place for a group of like-minded\npeople to come together, magazines provide a sampling of what a group of\nlike-minded people might say in such an instance so that you can pretend\nyou\u2019re part of them. Go down the list and you\u2019ll see.\n\nThe magazines of Cond\u00e9 Nast, for example, export \u201clifestyles\u201d. Most\nreaders probably aren\u2019t the \u201chip scene\u201d the magazines supposedly cover,\nbut by reading these things they learn what to wear and what to buy and\nwhat these people are talking about.

Similarly, the new *SEED*\nmagazine is trying to export the culture of science, so people who\naren\u2019t themselves scientists can get a piece of the lab coat life.\n\nAlumni magazines similarly export college life, so that graying former\ncollege students can relive some of their old glory days, reading pieces\nabout library renovations as they recall having sex in the stacks. And\nhouse organs export a particular kind of politics, telling you what a\nparty or organization\u2019s take is on the issues of the day, giving you a\nsense of the party line.\n\nRun down the list and in pretty much every case you scratch a magazine,\nyou find an exported community.

Counting, by contrast, is easy. This, at least, is the\npremise behind the Nurses Health Study, a multi-decade project by\nHarvard to gather empirical information about nutrition. The idea behind\nthe study is simple: collect a reasonably large group of people all in a\nrather similar situation (nurses) and have them fill out a yearly survey\nwith two questions: \u201cwhat did you eat?\u201d and \u201care you dead yet?\u201d They\u2019ve\nbeen doing this since 1976.\n\nThen you simply punch the information into a computer and figure out\nwhat foods kill people. The results, as described in the associated book\n*Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy* provide some simple tips for living longer.\n\n**Replace white bread with whole wheat.** White bread is simply whole\nwheat bread shorn of all its nutritional value. Whole wheat has more\nnutrients, more protein, etc. Plus, white bread is metabolized quickly\nby your body so it leads to huge spikes in blood sugar which have\nunhealthy effects on your body and make you hungry after you crash;\nwhole wheat bread is digested more evenly.\n\n**Replace burgers with chicken.** Dark meat when grilled can lead to\npotential carcinogens, whereas white meat is overall healthier.

Circulation fees only make up 20% of newspaper revenue,\nso all things considered one wouldn\u2019t think this would be an existential\nthreat to the business.\n\nCraigslist has been a bigger deal; classified ads used to be 40% of\nnewspaper revenue, versus just 30% now. But even magazines, which have\nnever run classifieds, are feeling the pinch.\n\nThe real issue is that online ad prices per reader are far, far lower\nthan offline prices. But why is that?\n\nI\u2019ve heard lots of theories, but I think the real explanation is simple:\nsupply and demand. If you want to buy an offline ad, there are only a\nhandful of places you can buy it. As a result, supply is constrained and\nthe price goes up. But online, ad networks let just about everybody sell\nads on an equal footing. Practically, it doesn\u2019t make that much\ndifference whether your ad appears on nytimes.com or politico.com or\neschatonblog.com, as long as it reaches the same person. So supply goes\nup and the price gets bid down.\n\nMost people don\u2019t seem to like this explanation, so I\u2019ll try phrasing it\nanother way. In the days of paper, to get your ad to people you had to\nget it on a truck and into their hands on something they would read.\nNewspapers and magazines could charge a premium for this.

But over the same period,\ncompensation for actual workers stayed the same or even went down. In\nthis book, Simon Head investigates the other side of technology: the way\nit keeps the average worker down.\n\nHead finds that \u201cscientific management\u201d \u2014 the system that turned\nassembly lines into sweatshops in the 1880s \u2014 has expanded to conquer\nthe service sector as well. Where old management consultants reorganized\nfactories to deskill workers (by making them repeat mindless jobs over\nand over) and regulate behavior (by having overseers and stopwatches\nmaking sure they met their quotas), new management consultants\nreorganize call centers to deskill workers (by having them simply read\nscripts off a computer screen) and regulate behavior (by having their\ncomputers measure how long they spend on the phone and at lunch and in\nthe bathroom).\n\nBut it\u2019s not just call centers: Head finds the same technological\nreengineering of business in everything from factories to doctor\u2019s\noffices, where HMO-enforced policies require doctors to do little more\nthan type symptoms into a computer and prescribe the recommended\ntreatment, with little time to investigate what might actually be wrong\nwith the patient.\n\nHead\u2019s argument is much like that of David Noble in *Forces of\nProduction*: we had a choice about how to use new technology. We could\nuse it to turn employees into ever-more-skilled craftspeople, allowing\nthem to be more effective and creative in their jobs now that they had\nmachines to do their dirty work. Or we could use it to turn employees\ninto faster cogs for a machine, forcing them to follow rigidly-composed\nscripts carefully specifying their role.\n\nWe are once again choosing the second. Only this time it may hurt\ncompanies, not just employees. At least in manufacturing jobs, you can\nkeep some kind of quality control tracking on the final product. A\nToyota may not be very good, but if everyone follows the rules at least\nthey will all be about the same. Service industry jobs require dealing\nwith individual customers in all their messiness. And customers don\u2019t\nmake good components in carefully \u201creengineered\u201d machines.\n\nThe result is things like the infuriating 1-800 numbers we\u2019re all\nfamiliar with: incompetent customer support, useless service, uninformed\nadvice. Which means customers walk away. As management cuts costs by\noutsourcing their call centers to less and less skilled employees, they\nalso cut profits by alienating their customer base. (Head cites powerful\nstudies by Frederick Reichheld finding that tiny increases in customer\nretention can lead to doublings in revenue.)\n\nHead writes clearly and plainly, although the book lacks the concision\nof his brilliant pieces for the *New York Review of Books* (which this\nbook grew out of). And while he does do some on-the-ground reporting,\nespecially from car factories, the book has more of an eye for acronyms\nthan for anecdotes. This is disappointing, because the techniques at the\nheart of the book (the automated systems for monitoring employees) would\nmake for gripping reading, yet Head never gives us a glimpse of what\nthey actually look like in practice.\n\nFor those with only a little time, the key chapter (6) [is available\nonline](http://www.tcf.org/Publications/EconomicsInequality/ch6.pdf)\n[PDF].

When\nI first looked into it, I thought it was just a crackpot theory and I\nwas curious why anyone would believe this,\u201d explains Brian Flemming. \u201cTo\nmy surprise I found the evidence kept stacking up. The more I looked\ninto it, the more that the facts aligned with those who said Jesus was\njust a legendary character. The shaky evidence and the poor reasoning\nwere actually on the side of those who said that Jesus did exist.\u201d\n\nAnd so Flemming (*Bat Boy: The Musical*, *Nothing So Strange*, *Fair &\nBalanced*, and all-around digital rights supporter) decided to make a\nmovie. The result, which is currently being screened across the country\nin theaters and at atheist organizations and will be released on DVD\nsoon, is a shockingly good film.\n\nFlemming begins at the beginning: the popular story of Jesus. In a\nhilarious montage of old footage taken from the Prelinger archives\nunderneath deadpan narration, he tells the story in six minutes. And\nthen it\u2019s on to debunking it. Through interviews with various experts,\nillustrated with entertaining graphics, he tries to reconstruct the\nhistorical evidence for the story\u2026only to find there isn\u2019t much and a\nlot doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nConvinced the story is wrong, Flemming takes aim at the right-wing\nChristian fundamentalists who act based on it, the wishy-washy Christian\nmoderates who enable them, and the rest of the system. He concludes by\nheading back home to the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as\na child to confront the principal about what he\u2019s teaching children.\n\nFlemming\u2019s previous film, *Nothing So Strange* ([which I also\nreviewed](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001102)) was interesting but, in\nfairness, rather amateurish. No such criticism can be made of this film,\nwhich has some of the best graphics I\u2019ve seen in a documentary and a\nbrilliant score composed from the Creative Commons-licensed Wired CD by\nthe hertofore-unknown DJ Madson (a nom-de-plume of Flemming, I\u2019m\nbeginning to suspect) by remixing popular artists. The whole thing, from\nthe interviews down to the promotional posters, hangs together so well\nthat it\u2019s hard to believe Flemming is doing this all himself, but\napparently he is, with no liberal atheist conspiracy to back him.\n\n(Although, in full disclosure, Larry Lessig and former Creative Commons\nexecutive director Glenn Otis Brown receive special thanks in the\ncredits. And in a remote Q&A via iChat after the screening here at\nStanford, Flemming was wearing a Creative Commons shirt. So if you want\nto investigate a conspiracy, that\u2019s where I\u2019d look.)\n\nOn the other hand, Flemming has always had what Bill O\u2019Reilly might call\na \u201cparasitic\u201d sense of self-promotion. His film *Nothing So Strange*\nreceived press largely because it included scenes of Bill Gates being\nassassinated. And during the California Recall, Flemming jumped into the\nfray on the platform \u201cIf elected, I will resign.\u201d (Thus making Lt.\nGovernor Bustamante governor, since at the time he was refusing to run,\nthinking he\u2019d draw support away from the actual governor.) When FOX sued\nAl Franken for using the phrase \u201cFair and Balanced\u201d, Flemming wrote a\nplay with the name. When Arnold Schwarzenegger sued the makers of a\nbobblehead version of him, Flemming posted a photo of Arnold\u2019s penis.\n\nBoth times, he insisted the works were a form of political protest, but\nhe still charged money for the products. He did the same when he\nreleased portions of *Nothing So Strange* under a Creative Commons\nlicense. It\u2019s one thing to support free speech; it\u2019s another to try to\nmake money off of other people\u2019s support for it. What\u2019s unsettling about\nthis film is not how Flemming is using various atheist groups to screen\nand promote it \u2014 that\u2019s perfectly reasonable, especially since he\u2019s\ngiving the DVDs to the groups at outrageously low prices.\n\nNo, what\u2019s unsettling is a hidden feature on Flemming\u2019s site called the\nGrassroots Promotion Team or GPT. In general these things are nothing\nnew \u2014 just personally, I remember volunteering for Apple when the iMac\ncame out and joining a \u201cStreet Team\u201d website to promote a Buffy DVD. The\nidea behind such sites is that your particular group of obsessive lonely\nfans will spend their free time promoting your products on various\nforums and websites in exchange for a chance to win some lame prizes.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when big corporations do this, but when independent political\nfolks like Flemming do it, it becomes a little creepy. It\u2019s also\nproblematic. Take the movie\u2019s soundtrack, which is sold on Amazon.\nNormally such obscure CDs have hardly any reviews. But this one not only\nhad 11, but they were all amazingly glowing. \u201cWow, this CD must be\nreally good,\u201d I thought. But when I saw Flemming was awarding 100\n\u201cpoints\u201d for each Amazon review, it suddenly made sense. If everyone\nplays this game, Amazon reviews will quickly become meaningless, which\nis why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good idea to start.\n\nThe film is valuable and grassroots promotion of it is certainly a good\nthing. I just wish it felt a little less like using well-meaning people\nto make money for Flemming and a little more like a cooperative\ncommunity with the aim of spreading the Real News.\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Brian Flemming responds:*\n\nThanks for the kind words about the movie. I agree with some of your\ncriticism of the street team, but I think your aim is off the mark with\nmuch of it.\n\n1.  AMAZON REVIEWS. There\u2019s an old phrase in publicity, \u201cI don\u2019t care if\n    the review is positive or negative, just put the title in the\n    headline.\u201d As an indie filmmaker always struggling to get the word\n    out against competing messages backed by tens of millions of\n    dollars, I definitely subscribe to this philosophy. It was never the\n    design of the movie\u2019s street team to load up Amazon with praise\n    (frankly, a mix of angry one-star reviews and passionate five-star\n    reviews would be better). It\u2019s no secret that authors and their\n    publishers and friends stack the Amazon book reviews (as has been\n    documented), but I don\u2019t wish to add to that clutter. I\u2019ve never\n    asked anyone to post nice things on Amazon about the soundtrack CD\n    for The God Who Wasn\u2019t There, or to withhold negative statements\n    (and I have not posted a review myself). Street team members are\n    given a free (digital) copy of the soundtrack and encouraged to go\n    to Amazon and post a review of the music\u2014that\u2019s it. About 5% of them\n    do. There\u2019s no incentive to make the review positive or negative.\n    However, while I think the street team members\u2019 reviews of the\n    soundtrack CD on Amazon are sincere, and no harm has been done, this\n    particular sample does naturally skew positive\u2014if you\u2019re on the\n    street team, you probably like the film/soundtrack you\u2019ve decided to\n    back with your time. But then again, reviews are inherently\n    biased\u2014and fans tend to be more motivated than others in posting.\n    Most reviews on Amazon for most media products are positive for that\n    reason. I\u2019ll freely admit to sending people to Amazon\u2014but my goal is\n    battling obscurity, not battling negative opinion. And I certainly\n    can\u2019t stop anyone from posting a negative review.\n\n2.  THE STREET TEAM ITELF. A \u201cstreet team\u201d is a group of volunteer\n    supporters who distribute flyers and stickers and otherwise spread\n    the word about a band or film online and offline. You say, \u201cIt\u2019s sad\n    when big corporations do this, but when independent political folks\n    like Flemming do it, it becomes a little creepy.\u201d Here\u2019s where I\n    think your aim is considerably off the mark. To be opposed to a\n    street team is nearly tantamount to being opposed to the very idea\n    of promoting indie artists. I believe promotion should be honest and\n    ethical, but promotion itself is not an evil. And organizing\n    promotion is not an evil. To eliminate street teams would be largely\n    to give up and turn over the marketplace to those who have the money\n    to promote via advertising and other expensive means. It would\n    strengthen messages backed by money and weaken messages backed by\n    passion. I think the street team for The God Who Wasn\u2019t There is a\n    great example of passion being organized into action, and I\u2019m proud\n    of it. I give theatrical rights away for free\u2014and then a group like\n    SF Atheists holds a screening and earns upwards of \\$1000 to help\n    their extremely important efforts. Volunteers go to a website where\n    grassroots action is made easier\u2014and conversations all over the web\n    get started over whether Jesus really did exist, a very legitimate\n    question that is nonetheless the third rail of mainstream-media\n    conversations about Christianity. Street teams aren\u2019t \u201ccreepy,\u201d and\n    this one in particular is doing some very real, verifiable good.\n\n3.  MONEY. You write that when I attacked Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill\n    O\u2019Reilly via Fair Use Press, I \u201cinsisted the works were a form of\n    political protest, but [Flemming] still charged money for the\n    products. He did the same when he released portions of Nothing So\n    Strange under a Creative Commons license. It\u2019s one thing to support\n    free speech; it\u2019s another to try to make money off of other people\u2019s\n    support for it.\u201d Really, I\u2019m just shaking my head in wonder at this\n    accusation. I have never made any profit whatsoever from any of my\n    Fair Use Press e-books. The Schwarzenegger attack was given away,\n    with a high-res \u201cpremium\u201d edition sold at first for \\$1 (both\n    editions are free now and have been for about a year). I added a \\$1\n    price to that specifically to demonstrate fair use\u2014that I wasn\u2019t\n    taking a \u201cnoncommercial\u201d copout, so Schwarzenegger and his attorney\n    couldn\u2019t claim that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t sue. That\u2019s what my activism\n    through Fair Use Press is about\u2014demonstrating the limits of fair\n    use. I want people to look at what I do, see that I got away with\n    it, and then do more of the same. The commercial marketplace\u2014where\n    messages like Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s already live\u2014is an important\n    battlefield in this fight. Just because I fight in that space\n    doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m making a profit from Fair Use Press. I don\u2019t, and\n    it certainly isn\u2019t part of the plan (I spend far more on promotion\n    and advertising than I take in). And my best-case scenario for The\n    God Who Wasn\u2019t There is to break even on marketing expenses\n    (production costs are already written off, gladly, as a loss). All\n    of my indie-film work and free-culture activism operates in the red,\n    subsidized by the Hollywood work-for-hire assignments I take that\n    also pay my rent. I\u2019m not, as you say, \u201cusing well-meaning people to\n    make money.\u201d I\u2019m putting in my own money and time to the same\n    purpose as the people I\u2019m working side-by-side with.

Where it gets creepy is when\nthis natural enthusiasm is co-opted and channeled into a structured,\ntop-down sort of system. Now I\u2019m not just expressing my opinions, I\u2019m\nfollowing orders so I can get goodies. That fundamentally changes\nthings.\n\nMaybe an analogy will help. My mom likes telling people about\ninteresting things I\u2019ve done. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this \u2014 the\npeople she talks to like knowing this stuff. But you have to admit it\nwould be creepy if I started providing my mom with a list of my\nachievements and awarding her points every time she found a way to\nmention them. Mom begins to feel used, her friends begin to feel duped,\nand I look like a narcissist.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to get rid of the promotion system, just scale it back a\nlittle. Provide a list of suggested actions, a forum where people can\ntalk about what they\u2019re doing, and then offer to mail a t-shirt or\nsomething to people who work hard.\n\nYou see, contrary to popular opinion \u2014 even in the free culture\ncommunity, oddly enough \u2014 rewards are incredibly destructive.

The protests become so overwhelmingly large that even their\n    opponents pretend to be part of them, so as not to be on the wrong\n    side of history.\n\nIt seems pretty clear that the Internet helps with 1 \u2014 after all, it\u2019s\nbrought together groups of crazy committed people about every other\ntopic, from *Smallville* slash fiction to high-energy astrophysics. It\u2019d\nbe very surprising if it didn\u2019t bring committed activists together too.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly helped with 2 \u2014 YouTube videos of protestors being\nmistreated by police have been a staple of the \\#occupy movement, even\nthough they haven\u2019t gotten much coverage on traditional TV; We are all\nKhaled Said presumably reached some people in Egypt.\n\n3 and 4 are when the cable news and satellite television stations start\njoining in and when people support the protest just because it\u2019s such a\nhuge physical presence in their lives. Here, I agree, the Internet\nprobably has less effect.\n\nThe problem is that you never get to 3 and 4 without 1 and 2 \u2014 I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a total accident that all of these protests are happening\nnow. I think they\u2019re happening because 1 and 2 have been made much\neasier thanks to the Internet.

And technology is making us lose sight of\nthat.\n\n(I maybe doing Lanier too great a service by attributing such a coherent\nview to him as nothing quite so clear is ever actually expressed in the\narticle. Nonetheless, I will continue as if this is Lanier\u2019s view.)\n\nIt is an interesting point, but what Lanier finds so frightening is\nprecisely what I find so exciting about these technologies. I still\nremember the light bulb that went off in my head when my friend Dan\nConnolly answered a question by saying \u201cAccording to Google, X is the\ncase.\u201d \u201cGoogle\u201d had said no such thing, of course, but the Google\nalgorithm had processed all the links on the Web and send Dan the page\nit thought most relevant to his query. It was this particular page that\nsaid X, of course, but the notion that Google itself was answering\nquestions in this way was a revelation.\n\nThe same is true of Wikipedia. There are individual people, obviously,\nbut what makes Wikipedia so fascinating are the technical and social\nprocesses that combine their work, turning it into something no\nindividual person is responsible for or would necessarily endorse.\n\nI often find myself wondering what Wikipedia would say about\nsuch-and-such a subject or how important Wikipedia thinks something else\nis. I refuse to edit my Wikipedia page, not only because it\u2019s bad form,\nbut because I\u2019m genuinely curious about how Wikipedia sees me.

Lots of\npeople write reviews of television shows, but nobody seems to collect\nand organize them all. Good introductory guides to subjects are\nessential for learning, yet I only stumble upon them by chance. The\ncumulative knowledge of science is one of our most valuable cultural\nproducts, yet it can only be found scattered across thousands of short\narticles in hundreds of different journals.\n\nI suspect the same thoughts occur to many of a similar cast of mind,\nsince there\u2019s so much effort put into discouraging them. The arbiters of\nrespectable opinion are frequently found to mock such grand projects or\npoint out deficiencies in them. And a friend of mine explained to me\nthat soon out of school he nearly killed himself by trying to embark on\nsuch a grand project and now tries to prevent his friends from making\nthe same mistake.\n\nOne can, of course, make the reverse argument: since there is so much\nneed for such organization projects, they must be pretty impossible. But\nupon closer inspection, that isn\u2019t true. Is there a project more grand\nthan an encyclopedia or a dictionary? Who dares to compress all human\nknowledge or an entire language into a single book? And yet, there\u2019s not\njust one but several brands of each!\n\nIt seems that when the audience is large enough (and just about everyone\nhas use for encyclopedias and dictionaries), it is possible to take on\ngrand projects. This suggests that the hold-up is not practical, but\neconomic. The funding simply isn\u2019t there to do the same for other\nthings.\n\nBut all this is only true for the era of the book, where such a project\nmeans gathering together a group of experts and having them work\nfull-time to build a Reference Work which can be published and sold\nexpensively to libraries. I tend to avoid net triumphalism, but the\nInternet, it would seem, changes that. Wikipedia was created not by\ndedicated experts but by random strangers and while we can complain\nabout its deficiencies, all admit that it\u2019s a useful service.\n\nThe Internet is the first medium to make such projects of mass\ncollaboration possible. Certainly numerous people send quotes to Oxford\nfor compilation in the Oxford English Dictionary, but a full-time staff\nis necessary sort and edit these notes to build the actual book (not to\nmention all the other work that must be done). On the Internet, however,\nthe entire job \u2014 collection, summarization, organization, and editing \u2014\ncan be done in spare time by mutual strangers.\n\nAn even more striking, but less remarked-upon, example is Napster.\nWithin only months, almost as a by-product, the world created the most\ncomplete library of music and music catalog data ever seen. The\ncontributors to this project didn\u2019t even realize they were doing this!\nThey all thought they were simply grabbing music for their own personal\nuse. Yet the outcome far surpassed anything consciously attempted.\n\nThe Internet fundamentally changes the practicalities of large\norganization projects. Things that previously seemed silly and\nimpossible, like building [a detailed guide to every television\nshow](http://tviv.org/) are now being done as a matter of course. It\nseems like we\u2019re in for an explosion of such modern reference works,\nperhaps with new experiments into tools for making them.\n", "external_links": ["http://tviv.org/"], "time": 1153206000.0, "postid": "masscollab", "internal_links": []}, "kahlevashcroft": {"post_title": "Kahle v.

Ashcroft argument in the style\nof a Wired News piece. Unlike [my last parody of Wired\nNews](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/startupschool), this one [actually\ngot posted on\nwired.com](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2006/11/ringside_at_cop.html),\nalbeit only on one of their blogs. I hope to write a real post about\nthis but I\u2019m feeling too crummy to do it today.*\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, California\u2014Acclaimed Stanford professor Lawrence Lessig\nand Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle argued Monday that the\nchanges in the Copyright Act should be subject to the scrutiny of the\nFirst Amendment. In the case *Kahle v. Gonzales*, argued here at the\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, Brewster Kahle is arguing that he should\nbe permitted to make \u201corphaned works\u201d\u2014works whose copyright holder can\nno longer be located\u2014available for free on his website.\n\nThe case began after Lessig\u2019s loss before the Supreme Court in his\nprevious suit, *Eldred v. Ashcroft*. Lessig argued that Congress\u2019s\nperpetual extension of the copyright act violated the Constitution\u2019s\nrequirement that copyright only be granted for \u201climited Times\u201d. The\nCourt disagreed, saying that Congress was allowed to modify copyright\nlaw as long as it didn\u2019t change the law\u2019s \u201ctraditional contours\u201d.\n\nNow Lessig is back, arguing that Congress has done just that. For nearly\ntwo hundred years, he notes, copyright has been an \u201copt-in\u201d system.\nAuthors who wanted their work to be copyrighted had to mark it with a\ncopyright symbol, file a registration with the Copyright Office, deposit\na copy with the Library of Congress, and file a renewal if they wanted\nto receive the full term. All that changed with the sweeping 1976\nCopyright Act, which made a work copyrighted as soon as it was \u201cfixed in\na tangible form\u201d.\n\nUnder the old system, according to Lessig, 93% of works went into the\npublic domain before their term had expired. Now, 0% do.\n\nLessig argues that such a fundamental change \u2014 moving copyright from an\nopt-in to an opt-out system \u2014 constitutes a change in the law\u2019s\n\u201ctraditional contours\u201d and thus, under the precedent set in *Eldred*,\nmeans the law must be examined by a Court to see if it violates the\nFirst Amendment.\n\nThe Government disagrees, insisting that the only \u201ctraditional contours\u201d\nthe *Eldred* decision refers to are the \u201cfair use\u201d provision of the\ncopyright law, which allows for the public to make certain uses of\ncopyrighted works, and the \u201cidea-expression dichotomy\u201d, which means that\nideas cannot be directly copyrighted, only their expression. The 1976\nlaw did not change either of these.\n\nThe judges hearing the case asked Lessig to explain how this case\ndiffered from *Eldred*. \u201cIn *Eldred* the argument was about whether\nCongress could retrospectively extend the copyright law to keep Mickey\nMouse out of the public domain,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis case is only about\n\u2018orphaned works\u2019 \u2014 works whose copyright holders can\u2019t even be tracked\ndown to give permission.\u201d \u201cUnlike Disney,\u201d the judge added.\n\nThe *Kahle* case is part of a multi-pronged strategy to deal with\norphaned works. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) has introduced a bill\ncalled the \u201cPublic Domain Enhancement Act\u201d. The idea, based on a *New\nYork Times* op-ed published by Lessig shortly after his loss in\n*Eldred*, is that copyright holders will need to send \\$1 to the\ngovernment after 50 years to renew their copyright. If they don\u2019t send\nthe dollar, their works will go into the public domain. But even if they\ndo, their name and address will be on file so others who wish to use the\nwork will know how to contact them.\n\nThe US Copyright Office has also held hearings on the subject of\n\u201corphaned works\u201d, concluding in a hundred-page report sent to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee that \u201cThe orphan works problem is real.\u201d and\n\u201cLegislation is necessary to provide a meaningful solution to the orphan\nworks problem as we know it today.\u201d\n\nPlaintiff Brewster Kahle founded the Internet Archive after selling his\ncompany Alexa to Amazon.com in the 1990s. The site, as Kahle often says,\nprovides \u201cinfinite bandwidth and infinite disk space for infinite time\u201d\nto freely-licensed works. Kahle wants to have his website provide\norphaned works, just as libraries make available out-of-print books, but\nunder current law would have to track down the copyright holder for\nevery work.\n\nThe same problem plagues projects like Google\u2019s Book Search. Presently,\nGoogle must track down the copyright holder before making a book\npublicly available or face hefty fines. But since copyright terms are\nnow so long, this means most out-of-print books will never be available,\nsimply because their copyright holders are so difficult to find.\n\nThe Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next year.\n", "external_links": ["http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2006/11/ringside_at_cop.html"], "time": 1163664000.0, "postid": "kahlevashcroft", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/startupschool"]}, "quantumbrain": {"post_title": "A Very Speculative Theory of Free Will", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Very Speculative Theory of Free Will\n======================================\n\n*Previously:* [How Quantum Mechanics is Compatible with Free\nWill](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/quantumwill)\n\n*Attention conservation notice:* I am well aware that this post will get\nme called all sorts of silly names and insults (Penrosian apparently the\nworst among them). For once, I am not going to respond. I just think the\ntheory ought to be published and if you are not inclined to believe it,\nthen feel free to ignore it.\n\nThe big mystery of the mind is reconciling two things: what we know\nabout the physical structures of the brain and what we experience from\nday to day as conscious people. The first tells us that our brain is\nmade up of a series of interconnected neurons which fire in response to\ncertain inputs. The second tells us that people have subjective unified\nexperiences and at least the appearance of free will. It seems hard to\nexplain how the first can lead to the second, although they\u2019re obviously\nconnected somehow.\n\nSo, for example, if we\u2019re looking at certain visual illusions, we can\nchoose to see them one way or to see them another way. And obviously\nthis choice has some impact on the rest of the brain, especially the\npart that processes vision. But nobody\u2019s been able to find the place in\nthe brain from which such choices originate.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the subject to vouch for it, but [this\narticle](http://www.quantummechanicsandreality.com/Primer/iia8_brain.htm)\nclaims that neurons are small enough that we could see quantum effects\nin their high-level behavior:\n\n> The juncture between two neurons is called the synapse. Each of the\n> perhaps 100 billion neurons in the brain is connected to about 1,000\n> other neurons. At the synapse, a firing neuron either passes a\n> neurochemical signal to the next neuron, or it does not pass a signal,\n> with the passing or not passing depending on the complex\n> neurochemistry of the synapse. If, within a millisecond, a certain\n> number of signals are passed on to a neuron, then that neuron will\n> fire. Otherwise it will not fire. Thus what happens at the various\n> synapses\u2014signal passed on or not passed on\u2014is the sole determinant of\n> the firing pattern of the neurons in the brain. The synapses are the\n> control points for our flow of thoughts.\n>\n> The synaptic gap, the gap between one neuron and the next, is quite\n> small, 3.5 nanometers, which is about 35 (hydrogen) atoms. The sizes\n> of the adjacent parts of the synapse, where much of the neurochemistry\n> goes on, are also small, on the order of 3,500 atoms wide. Now one of\n> the peculiar effects of quantum mechanics is that if the volume where\n> an atom might be located (the place where the wave function is\n> non-zero) is initially small, it will spread out in time. One can use\n> Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle to show that a calcium ion, for\n> example, will spread out to the size of the synapses (not just the\n> synaptic gap) in about .1 milliseconds (see 8 below). Neural processes\n> in the brain occur on a time scale of a millisecond, ten times slower\n> than the spread of a calcium ion over the whole synapse.\n\nSo here\u2019s the proposal: a series of entangled quantum particles at the\nsynaptic level allow for coordinated firing patterns which occur in\nresponse to choices by our conscious free will. Just as my previous post\nreconciled free will with statistical randomness, this would seem to\nreconcile free will with the neuroanatomy.\n\nIt still seems incredible that there is some high-level coordinated\nprocess with its fingers in the quantum effects of our synapses. But we\nknow something incredible is going on because we have subjective\nexperience. So this doesn\u2019t seem like much of a stretch to me.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.quantummechanicsandreality.com/Primer/iia8_brain.htm"], "time": 1201507200.0, "postid": "quantumbrain", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/quantumwill"]}, "realgoodbooks": {"post_title": "Real Good Books", "tags": [], "post_content": "Real Good Books\n===============\n\nJuly 4, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/realgoodbooks)\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo I was sitting there, reading Natalie Angier\u2019s *[The\nCanon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618242953)* and complaining to my\nroommate. \u201cGod, this book is so overwritten,\u201d I whined. \u201cThis is the\nworst science book since Lauren Slater published *Opening Skinner\u2019s\nBox*.\u201d I read her a random sentence: \u201cAm I sounding a self-pitying,\nsour-grapes-turned-defensive whine?

Unfortunately, this plan didn\u2019t go as well as I had hoped \u2014\ngood books are harder to find that it might seem at first. I realized\nwhat I really wanted was books that were compulsively readable, the kind\nthat once you slurped down like wet noodles, where once you started in\non them you just couldn\u2019t stop.\n\nI\u2019ve read a couple books like that, but not many. For example, [David\nBoies\u2019 autobiography](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375726551) isn\u2019t the\nkind of thing I would normally pick up. Self-aggrandizing\nautobiographies aren\u2019t exactly my thing and Boies, while interesting,\nisn\u2019t exactly a topic of fascination for me. But when I found myself\nholding it with a couple minutes to kill, I started reading it and\nbefore I noticed it I was most of the way through the 500 page book.\n\nOr take James Wolcott\u2019s *[Attack\nPoodles](http://books.theinfo.org/go/140135212X)*. Now I love a good\nmedia-bashing as much as the next guy, but this one I just couldn\u2019t put\ndown. I had to sneak away from dinner to finish reading it. And when it\nwas done, I found myself wanting more.\n\nWhat both books have in common, aside from being fun reads, is a small\nred rectangle on in the upper left of their covers. The rectangle is\npart of the \u201cMiramax Books\u201d logo which stretches from the back cover\naround the spine to the front of every book they publish. As far as I\nknow, Miramax is the only publisher audacious enough to put their logo\non the cover of their books, and while I initially took it as a sign of\nHollywood arrogance, I now see it as something else: a mark of quality.\nPerhaps, I figured, Miramax works so hard to make their books readable\nthat they want to capitalize on that brand by making it really clear\nwhich ones were theirs. I even dreamed of having my books published by\nMiramax.\n\nSo when my plan for June fizzled out, I tried to think of how I could\nfix things for July. And I hit upon the idea of spending it only reading\nMiramax books. Unfortunately for me, when the Weinstein Brothers (who\nran Miramax) left Disney, Miramax Books got the axe. The Weinstein\nBrothers have restarted their book division at their new company\n(cleverly named The Weinstein Company, apparently because Fellowship\nAdventure Group was [\u201ctoo\ngay\u201d](http://gawker.com/topic/the-weinsteins-fellowship-adventure-group-015542.php))\nbut their first real book doesn\u2019t come out until September.\n\nSo here\u2019s a plea to you readers: where does one find compulsively\nreadable books?

So the new class of COX-2 inhibitors,\nlike Vioxx, were supposed to stop the pain without the nasty stomach\nside-effects.\n\nOf course, aspirin has the additional side effect of protecting your\nheart, so when they designed a study demonstrating the benefits of\nVioxx, they made sure to a) exclude anyone with heart problems, and b)\ncompare it against Aleve, which doesn\u2019t have the same beneficial effects\nfor the heart.\n\nThe result of the study was shocking: despite all these efforts, the\npeople who took Vioxx had 4 times the number of heart problems as the\npeople who took Aleve. So what did the makers of Vioxx do? They told the\nFDA that this study showed how incredibly effective *Aleve* was at\nreducing heart attacks! Yes, it wasn\u2019t that Vioxx increased the risk of\na heart attack by 4 times \u2014 it was that Aleve magically reduced heart\nattacks by 80%.\n\nAnd the FDA believed them.\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/019530067X"], "time": 1265788800.0, "postid": "vioxx", "internal_links": []}, "interruptdriven": {"post_title": "The Interrupt-Driven Life", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Interrupt-Driven Life\n=========================\n\nAugust 20, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/interruptdriven)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter what seemed like years working in the Reddit isolation chamber, I\nbegun saying yes to all the interesting projects that came my way as\nsoon as I got out. And there were a lot of interesting projects.\n\nI signed up to build [a comprehensive catalog of every\nbook](http://demo.openlibrary.org/about), write three books of my own\n(since largely abandoned), consult on [a not-for-profit\nproject](http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/), help build [an encyclopedia of\njobs](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/avgpeople), get [a new\nweblog](http://sciencethatmatters.com/) off the ground, [found a\nstartup](http://jottit.com/), mentor two ambitious Google Summer of Code\nprojects (stay tuned), build a Gmail clone, write a new online\nbookreader, start a career in journalism, [appear in a\ndocumentary](http://www.stealthisfilm.com/Part2/), and research and\nco-author [a paper](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/whowriteswikipedia/).\nAnd that\u2019s not including all the stuff I normally do. I\u2019ve actually been\nspending most of my time catching up on my 2000 email backlog, reading a\nbook a week, following a bunch of weblogs, and falling in love. (Falling\nin love takes a shockingly huge amount of time!) Yes, it has been\npointed out to me that I\u2019m insane.\n\nClearly part of this is that I have some kind of severe psychological\nproblem (an inability to say no, an inclination toward stress, and a\nnasty habit of coping with stress by submerging myself in new projects).\nBut it\u2019s not completely failing either. Every project has kind of\nhalf-finished. Maybe this is worthless, maybe instead of half-finishing\nthirteen projects I should just completely finish one. But it doesn\u2019t\nseem obviously stupid \u2014 a half-finished project has *some* value\n(educational if nothing else) and it seems increasingly likely that some\nof them will get finished properly.\n\nSo how is it that I\u2019m able to do so many tasks that even I, upon\nreflection, can\u2019t see how they\u2019re all getting done? The secret is to be\ninterrupt-driven. Previously, if I wanted to do something, I\u2019d immerse\nmyself in that thing. I\u2019d wake up in the morning thinking about the\nproblem, spend all day either working on it, reading background\nmaterials for it, talking to friends about it, thinking about it in bed\nbefore I went to sleep and then dreaming about it. I\u2019m sure I did much\nbetter work this way: all that thinking and dreaming led to lots of\nideas I wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise. And it was fun, too. Immersing\nyourself in a problem can be very enjoyable. (*See* Mihaly\nCsikszentmihalyi.) But clearly, you can really only work on one problem\nat a time this way and it doesn\u2019t leave much room for other people in\nyour life.\n\nIn the new system, for every task I have a partner. And they\u2019re the one\nresponsible for thinking about it. Perhaps they don\u2019t immerse themselves\nin it totally like I sometimes did, but it takes up a substantial\nportion of their mental energy. And so, after we hash out the big plan\ntogether at the beginning, they work on it and think about it and worry\nabout it and when they get stuck or finish a piece or just want to talk\nabout it, they shoot me an email. Meanwhile, I sit at home and just deal\nwith these emails, answering questions and solving problems as they come\nup.\n\nNow while I think giving people a partner on these projects is really\nvaluable (I wish I had one on more of my immersive projects) I\u2019ll\nreadily admit that I\u2019m lousy at it. I\u2019ve been spending too much time ill\nand traveling and with people in my life to respond promptly or in\ndetail. (I\u2019m sorry guys; I\u2019m going to work hard to pare things down and\ndo better.)\n\nBut I think the larger principle is valuable. This is clearly how the\nreal big-shots \u201cget things done\u201d. Recall the scene in\n[*Brazil*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001313) where the harried\nexecutive strolls purposefully (yet aimlessly) through the corridors\nwith a trail of people waving papers behind him to which he barks either\nyes or no. (Reprised in [last week\u2019s\n*Psych*](http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/theshow/episodeguide/episodes/s2_meatismurder/index.html).)\nOf course, when things get that far, it\u2019s rather unclear who\u2019s actually\ndoing things. As with the political figure whose every minute is\nscheduled by their campaign manager or their chief of staff, one begins\nto wonder whether the others are working for the boss or whether the\nboss is simply working for them. In this way, moving up the corporate\nladder means giving up more and more of your power and freedom.\n\nAt some point I plan to go back to the immersive life. I have some big\nplans that are just important enough to need that kind of dedication.\nBut this is the year of Other People.

The folks at Android were not\nshy at what they were up to. One founder, who was in Boston at the same\ntime I was, stated it clearly: they were creating an open OS for phones.\nWhen asked what the point of this was, he suddenly got very vague.\n\nA couple years later Apple released the iPhone and what was now a Google\ndivision started rounding up partners for the Android OS. The press got\nwind of it and went crazy. Google was making a phone \u2014 a GPhone! How\ncould Apple compete? What fancy gadgets did it have? Would Google take\ncontrol of the cell phone industry too?\n\nAnd today, Google announced what they were doing: the same thing they\nwere always doing, the same thing Android had been doing since day one.\nThey\u2019re making an open OS for phones.\n\nThe only announcement today is of their new \u201cOpen Handset Alliance\u201d,\nwhich I can\u2019t help but feel is a jab at the Open Content Alliance (which\nGoogle pointedly refuses to join). Google has certainly put their clout\nbehind the team at Android and gotten an impressive number of people to\nsign up to support their little OS. But let\u2019s not let the press buzz get\nout of hand. Google isn\u2019t coming out with a phone, they\u2019re releasing an\nopen phone operating system.

In *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, for\nexample, we see that certain societies succeed because geography breaks\nthem up into chunks and prevents any one person with bad ideas from\ngetting control of too much, while other societies fail because their\nwhole territory can too easily be captured by an idiot.\n\nIt might at first seem more efficient to let the whole territory be\ncaptured by a genius, but a moment\u2019s reflection will show that there are\nfew geniuses whose brainpower can match the combined results of many\nindependent experiments. This has [fairly obvious applications to\nbusiness](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/googradient) and other fields,\nbut for a moment let\u2019s just think about the concept itself.\n\nThis idea is often presented as a defense of competition and the\ncapitalist market system that embraces it. Innovation only happens, such\npeople say, when lots of people are competing against each other for the\nprizes of success. In a communist country, where Big State decides what\nwill be worked on and how, there is no incentive to innovate. Only in a\ncountry like ours, where the victor gets the spoils, can new technology\nbe developed.\n\nAnd yet we also know that competition is a terrible way to get people do\nwell. In *No Contest: The Case Against Competition* (now out in [an\nelegant 20th anniversary\nedition](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0395631254)) we see dozens of\nstudies that show that, by all sorts of metrics, people\u2019s performance\n(and enjoyment) goes down when they are forced to compete. Even worse,\nit goes down most notably for creative tasks \u2014 precisely the kind of\nthing involved in innovation.\n\nHow do we resolve the contradiction? The key is to notice that\ncompetition, especially market competition, isn\u2019t the only way to\nencourage experimentation. And that\u2019s often hard to do, because\ntypically market competition is treated as the only sensible form of\ncompetition and competition as the only sensible form of\nexperimentation. But that\u2019s not at all the case.\n\nInstead of providing a prize for winner, we could provide rewards to\neveryone who tries. And that actually makes sense \u2014 not only because\n[prizes also decrease productivity and\ncreativity](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618001816) \u2014 but also because,\nwhen it comes to experimentation, it\u2019s not really your fault if the\nexperiment doesn\u2019t work. In fact, we want to encourage people to try\ncrazy things that might not work, which is exactly why rewards are so\ncounterproductive.\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t give an explicit prize, competition is still\nunhealthy. Contrary to what the apologists for market theology would\nlike you to believe, people do not work better when they\u2019re terrified of\nthe guy next to them finding the solution first. Which is why we should\nlook at this as simply experimentation, not competition.\n\nExperimentation can certainly be carried out cooperatively. Imagine many\ndifferent scientists in a lab, each trying different ideas during the\nday, swapping notes and tips over lunch, perhaps joining together to\nform small groups for certain experiments, or perhaps helping with\nlittle pieces of other projects in which they have particular expertise.\nEach scientist may disagree on which is the right direction to pursue,\nbut that doesn\u2019t make them enemies.\n\nThat\u2019s the way that science progresses.

Personally, I\nthink we\u2019re too tough on pedophiles, but I have to balance that on\nwanting a fervent anti-corruptionist to shake things up.

I know\nliterally nothing about this guy, but (suprise!) he\u2019s running unopposed.\n(Geez, this is getting boring; maybe I should run against one of these\npeople.)\n\n**State House (25 Middlesex):** Alice K.

It\u2019s a really, really good movie \u2014 probably\nthe best Disney film. So you should totally see it. First.]\n\n**UPDATE:** I missed a bunch the first time I saw the movie; this\nversion has been amended to include the subthemes about immigration and\nsocialization.\n\nThe film begins with Woody trying to defend a crumbling system of\ncommunism (presumably the Soviet Union). Toys have a duty to their\nowners, he argues. The owner is a personified totalitarian state\n(Stalin?) \u2014 he decides what the toys do and the toys are not permitted\nto escape. For some reason (false consciousness?), the other toys\ninstinctively agree with this but find the notion hard to sustain when\ntheir owner makes clear he doesn\u2019t want them anymore (massive\nunemployment).\n\nThe last straw is when, through a comic mishap, they get the\nmisimpression their owner is trying to throw them away. They feel this\nexistential threat releases them from their duty of\nloyalty.^[1](#fn:fn1)^ The state\u2019s one duty to its citizens is to keep\nthem alive; if it can\u2019t do that, the system falls apart. Note, however,\nthat it\u2019s only the misimpression that removes the duty. When they learn\n(from Mrs. Potato Head) that they were mistaken and Andy only planned to\nput them in the attic, they rush to return to him. The attic won\u2019t\nactually kill them and so doesn\u2019t remove the duty.\n\nCommunism having collapsed, the toys emigrate to Sunnyside (the US, that\nnation of immigrants), which leader Lotso depicts as a libertarian\nparadise. In his introductory he speech, he touts the joys of\nself-ownership and interacting with children through the market (new\nchildren are constantly replacing old ones, maximizing the efficiency of\nthe toys), as well as the improved material comforts his system brings\n(the repair depot, the dream house). The toys are enchanted.\n\nHowever, they quickly realize libertarian paradise is actually a far\nworse nightmare than communism. Lotso explains that immigrants have to\nwork their way up, starting by doing the painful, backbreaking jobs that\nthe current population (all former immigrants themselves) won\u2019t do.\nThere are a couple exceptions: Barbie is taken as a (Russian) mail-order\nbride and the entrepreneurial Buzz is chosen for promotion to the\nmanagerial class and resocialized so he won\u2019t sympathize with his old\ncomrades.^[2](#fn:fni)^\n\nSunnside\u2019s supposed freedom is actually slavery, complete with military\ndiscipline (via the reset Buzz) and a panopticon prison (via the monkey\nand symbolized by the treehouse). Their days are spent in torturous\nlabor from which there is no real escape. Lotso has used his freedom to\naccumulate all the power for himself and does not allow any for anyone\nelse.\n\nMeanwhile, Woody is adopted by Bonnie\u2019s benevolent dictatorship. People\nare given a second chance there \u2014 they can adopt new names, new\nidentities, and spend their days doing improv. They do work under\nBonnie\u2019s direction, but they do so voluntarily, and are free to leave if\nshe becomes a tyrant. As Andy makes clear at the end of the film, it is\nBonnie who owes a duty to the toys, not vice versa.\n\nBack at Sunnyside, the toys overthrow Lotso\u2019s capitalist domination by\nworking together, harnessing the collective power of the working class\nand using the managerial class (i.e. Ken and Bookworm) against itself\n(via deception and torture!). But their success eventually persuades\nsome members of the managerial class to become their allies (e.g. Ken,\ndespite having been tortured^[3](#fn:fn3)^, and ultimately Lotso\u2019s\nright-hand toy, Big Baby) and at a key moment they together overthrow\nthe capitalist Lotso, as Barbie gives a rousing speech nailing the key\nflaw with libertarianism: \u201cauthority should derive from the consent of\nthe governed, not the threat of force.\u201d\n\nHowever, the new revolutionaries also leave, preventing them from\ninstalling themselves as a new dictatorship of the proletariat. And in a\nfinal act betraying that he is finally beginning to question communism,\nWoody asks Andy (surely his first request of the state in his entire\nlife!) that his comrades be given to Bonnie. Andy agrees, and takes the\nextra step of giving Woody to Bonnie as well, finally dissolving his\nduties to the state.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken and Barbie now lead Sunnyside, making it a \u201cfun and\ngroovy\u201d socialist utopia. (Its actual day-to-day operation is, of\ncourse, left vague, but there is apparently lots of dancing in the\nstreets.) Having risen up and overthrown Lotso, the toys can now operate\non the basis of mutual equality. A happy ending for everyone.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  The same seems to apply to the Green Army Men who leave earlier, but\n    only because they (pretty reasonably) believe they\u2019re going to get\n    thrown away even when other toys just go to the\n    attic.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn1)\n\n2.

I\ndon\u2019t know about you, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it has to be one of\nthe most amazing things to ever grace our country\u2019s airwaves. Back when\nit started, over a decade ago now, it was unlike just about anything you\nheard on public radio. This wasn\u2019t a show about news or music or comedy.\nIt wasn\u2019t even, really, a show about people. It was a show about\nstories, stripped down to their pure essence, people talking to you with\na little bit of music in the background.\n\nHumans seem to have a natural craving for stories. Whatever the topic,\nit\u2019s more fun to hear a story about it. Everyone tells stories. Everyone\ntells stories, but some people love crafting them until they\u2019re perfect,\nlike little pastries of information with curves in all the right places.\nAnd that\u2019s what *This American Life* did each week on the radio: it\npresented three or four perfectly-crafted stories, all tangentially\nrelated to one loose theme, to your car or home for one full hour.\n\nA couple years ago the Showtime network called Ira Glass, the head and\nhost of *This American Life* and asked him if he wanted to make a\ntelevision version of his show. For most people, getting a call from a\ntelevision network would be a fairly big deal. But not Glass. Every\nweek, his radio show is heard by 1.6 million people. A hit show on\nShowtime gets half a million. So Glass said no, there was no way their\nshow would work on television. Still, Showtime persisted, asking what it\nwould take to make it work. So Glass thought of every crazy demand that\ncame to mind. And Showtime met them all.\n\nThe result, which premieres tonight on the pay-cable Showtime network,\nhas to be one of the most amazing things to grace American television.\nIt is unlike just about anything you\u2019ve ever seen on TV. The best way I\ncan think to describe it is this: Have you ever seen one of those stock\nphoto movies? You know, the kind with the lusciously oversaturated\ncolors, weird landscapes, and slow-motion movements? The kind of footage\nthat makes the normal world look magical? Now, take that, and imagine an\nentire television show made out of it. It\u2019s absolutely incredible.\n\nTo promote the show, since Showtime isn\u2019t exactly, *This American Life*\nwent on a six-city tour. I caught them in Chicago, where a jam-packed\ncrowd of dedicated fans (still pissed about the team moving to New York\nto film the TV show) came to hear \u201cWhat I Learned From Television\u201d. We\nwere in the Chicago Theater, a local landmark that holds thousands. And,\nI have to say, it\u2019s probably the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in a theater.\n\nYou know how on the radio show, they do these incredibly moving stories\nthat just send chills of emotion down your spine. Now imagine listening\nto that, in the middle of a crowd of thousands of people who all came\nout to hear the very same thing.

I\u2019m saying goodbye to the whole\nthing: that growing suspicion as the moment approaches, that sense of\nrealization when it comes, that rush of blood reddening your cheeks,\nthat brief but powerful desire to jump out of your own skin, and then\nfinally that attempt big fake smile trying to cover it all. Sure, it was\nfun for a while, but I think it\u2019s outlived its usefulness. It\u2019s time for\nembarrassment to go.\n\nTurning off an emotion is always a tough decision. I remember how a\ncouple years ago I decided to say goodbye to anger. Sure, anger has its\nbright moments \u2014 you haven\u2019t really lived until you\u2019ve known that\nspecial joy of hurling a chair across the room \u2014 but it\u2019s also quite\ntime-consuming. Every time someone comes up and hits you, you have to\nrun around chasing after them. And once you start getting angry it\u2019s\nhard to stop \u2014 an angry person doesn\u2019t really want to calm down, it sort\nof *enjoys* being angry. So I finally decided to get rid of the whole\nthing. And you know what? I haven\u2019t regretted the decision one bit.\n\nRegret \u2014 that\u2019s another interesting emotion. I mean, what purpose does\nit really serve? \u201cThere\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk,\u201d my mom once\ntold me when I started sobbing after I got milk all over the floor while\ntrying to make cereal. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true,\u201d I replied between sobs.\n\u201cAlthough maybe my tears will dilute the milk and make it stick to the\nfloor less.\u201d But I was wrong \u2014 the milk stayed just as sticky. So maybe\nregret should be the next one to go.\n\nBut actually, I think it\u2019s going to be frustration. It\u2019s not discussed\nmuch, but frustration is really quite distracting. You\u2019re trying to\nsolve some difficult problem but it\u2019s just not working. Instead of\ntaking a moment to try and think of the solution, you just keep getting\nmore and more frustrated until you start jumping up and down and\nsmashing various things. So not only do you waste time jumping, but you\nalso have to pay to replace the stuff you smashed. It\u2019s really a net\nloss.\n\nBut that\u2019s a decision for another time. Today it\u2019s time for\nembarrassment to join anger in the wastebasket of deactivated emotions.\nIt might take some getting used to at first \u2014 when friends try to tease\nme about something I\u2019ll probably start to react before realizing there\u2019s\njust no need for it anymore \u2014 but before long I\u2019m sure it will seem\nnormal. Even if I\u2019m a less normal person for it.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1136707200.0, "postid": "emotions", "internal_links": []}, "logicofloss": {"post_title": "The Logic of Loss", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Logic of Loss\n=================\n\nApril 13, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/logicofloss)\n\n* * * * *\n\nImagine someone offered you a 1% chance of winning a million dollars.\nHow much would you pay for it? The natural inclination would be to say\nyou break even at 1% of a million, which is \\$10,000. Even if you could\nscrape together the cash, this doesn\u2019t seem like a very good deal. After\nall, there\u2019s a 99% chance that you\u2019ll have just thrown away ten grand.\n\nWhere did we go wrong? The problem is that calculating the average value\nthis way only makes sense if you get to take the deal enough times to\nexpect an average result. If you bought a couple thousand of these\nchances at \\$9000 each, then you might start to come out ahead. But\nbuying just one doesn\u2019t seem very bright.\n\nOf course, the same logic applies to more pedestrian examples of risk.\nIt probably doesn\u2019t make sense to invest in just one startup, even if\nthe returns on startups are huge. That\u2019s why VCs invest in large numbers\nof startups; the returns from the wins balance out the flops.\n\nThis should seem pretty obvious, but some people seem to forget it a\nlot. Take the St. Petersburg paradox. Imagine this game: A dollar is\nplaced on the table and a coin is flipped. If the coin comes up heads,\nthe money is doubled and the coin is flipped again. Tails, the game ends\nand you take the money. How much would you pay to play?\n\nThe paradox comes about because the naive answer here is infinite.\nThere\u2019s a 50% chance you get a dollar (=fifty cents), a 25% chance you\nget 2 (another fifty cents), a 12.5% chance you get 4 (again), and so on\ninfinitely. But, naturally, it seems insane to pay a fortune to play\nthis game. Thus the paradox.\n\nFolks seem to be genuinely stumped about this, but it\u2019s just the first\noffer taken to the limit: instead of a 1% chance of making a million,\nyou have an infinitesimal chance of making an infinity. If you got to\nplay the game an infinite number of times, shelling out cash might begin\nto make sense, but if you only play it once it\u2019s not worth much.\n\nKeep that in mind next time someone offers you a game.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1239606000.0, "postid": "logicofloss", "internal_links": []}, "thegmh": {"post_title": "The Grim Meathook Future", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Grim Meathook Future\n========================\n\nDecember 17, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thegmh)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn the technology industry we have a phrase.

No, Kipnis\u2019s aim is to dismantle the entire social\ninstitution of, well, love \u2014 the notion that the right, meaningful, and\ndeeply human way to behave is to find one\u2019s perfect soulmate by the time\nschool ends and then spend the rest of your life living, having sex, and\nsharing your feelings with them. Kipnis thinks the whole thing is crazy,\na justification for locking people up in \u201cdomestic gulags\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty safe these days to get up and say our school systems are\ncrumbling, our borders are shot, our government is a mess, our voting\nsystem is broken, or even that our economic system needs an overhaul.\nBut try criticizing our system of love and all you\u2019ll get back is\nstunned silence. Love is \u201cthe one subject where no disagreement will be\nentertained, about which one truth alone is permissible\u201d (4). So\ncriticisms, unspeakable in plain form, are disguised as the content of\nour comedy (take my wife please!) and the subtext of our films (*The\nStepford Wives*, *Rosemary\u2019s Baby*).\n\nDespite the fact that most long-term relationships fall apart, nobody\nsuggests it\u2019s the idea of a long-term relationship that\u2019s the problem.\nInstead we\u2019re told that lasting relationships require \u201chard work\u201d. So\nyou go to work and put in some hard work and then come home and put in\nsome more. Or maybe you spend more time at the office to avoid having to\ncome home. Or maybe you channel your unfulfilled passion into shopping.\nEither way, capitalism wins.\n\nWe love to brag that we\u2019ve achieved genuine freedom in our romantic\nlives, laughing at those barbaric Muslims with their arranged marriages.\nBut is our system that much different? Careful studies find that people\nhave a suspiciously accurate habit of pairing up with people with a\nsimilar level of attractiveness and wealth (although sometimes an excess\nof one can compensate for a lack of the other). And then they promise to\nlive with each other forever, to working to make it work. Sure, perhaps\nyou get a little more latitude in picking your partner, but is this\nsystem really that different?\n\nMost people don\u2019t see love as a system to be criticized, but they do\nfeel the social straitjacket even if they assume it\u2019s just the \u201cnatural\u201d\nway relationships work out. And they begin looking for an escape. Kipnis\npoints to two: murder (\u201clethal intimate violence\u201d \u2014 killing your lover \u2014\nis so popular that there\u2019s an entire category in the crime statistics\nfor it) and adultery (its popularity needs no statistics). Kipnis shies\naway from explicitly defending either (take that, *Salon*!), but she\ndoes suggest that adultery is a little bit of radical activism against\nthe system, the critical practice of love.\n\nShe notes self-action generally comes before self-knowledge in these\nthings; workers had walk-outs before they had unions. In the same way,\nthe prevalence of adultery is people\u2019s individualized attempt at\nescaping from love, each one sneaking out for an affair, stealing time\nfrom work at work and work at home to embrace their feelings.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just capitalism, with its pro-love informercials and\ntelevision specials, that tries to fit us to the system; the government\ngets into the act too. Politicians lecture us about family values,\nbefore sneaking out to cheat on their wives; states tie legal marriage\nto thousands of benefits, making submission to its notions of monogamy a\nprerequisite for perks. (Try to have several wives, like some folks in\nUtah, and you\u2019ll find yourself in jail \u2014 not to mention the laws against\nadultery still on the books in 45 states.) And just imagine what it was\nlike before no-fault divorce, when you actually had to prove to the\ngovernment that you deserved to be unmarried, \u201cas if it were an injured\nlover refusing to let go once things were over\u201d (172).\n\nKipnis doesn\u2019t propose any particular solution; she just wants to ask\nthe question. The book is written in the style of the postmodern\nbombthrower, with far more meat than most books of such form, although\nsometimes the style\u2019s excesses get a little too heavy. The book\u2019s\nargument is studded with references to Freud and Marx and Marcuse, but\ndone in such a flip and enjoyable way (and with thumbnail sketches of\ntheir love lives) that it feels like gossip, not scholarship.\n\nBut perhaps the best bits are the poetic descriptions of what it\u2019s like\nto be in love, from how you \u201cfind[] yourself so voluptuously hurtled\ninto a state of possibility, a destabilizing,\nmight-be-the-start-of-something kind of moment. [\u2026] that first nervous\nphone call, coffee, or a drink, or\u2014circumstances permitting\u2014an\nincredible all-night marathon conversation\u201d (7) to the \u201c\u2018opening up\u2019\nrequired for relationship health [\u2026 which] will leave you feeling\nsomewhat vulnerable, lying there psychically spread-eagled, exposed, and\nshivering on the examining table of your relationship\u201d (76).\n\nThe book is a *tour de force* of writing, but even if it was dreadful,\nit\u2019d still be worth it.

Invite a bunch\nof the top people you know of in the field. Have them write the\nschedule.\n\nWhen you first arrive, Tim meets and greets at the door, his associates\nbehind him ask for your name and give you a badge and a t-shirt and a\nshort form to fill out. The form has your name on it and asks a few\nquestions about what you do and who they should invite next year and\nthat sort of thing. Then they take your photo and print it onto the top\nof the form and put all the forms up on the wall in a huge display that\nyou have to be pretty tall to see all of.\n\nYou mingle as everyone arrives and then you all cram into a big meeting\nroom. Tim and his compatriots give an opening address welcoming you to\nthe conference and explaining the format. Then everyone (all 300 people\nor so!) stand up and say their name, affiliation, and three words to\ndescribe themselves (usually going over). Sometimes people shout talk\nwhen they think the person should give a talk. Then Tim says a few more\nwords and they wheel out huge paper foam boards with the schedule\noutline printed on them. It lists the name of the room and the number of\npeople it approximately holds at the top and the session times on the\nside. Then Tim says go and there\u2019s a mad scramble to the boards with\npeople pushing each other out of the way to write down their preferred\nsession.\n\nThis always struck me as a bit silly for a computer company. The people\nI most want to hear \u2014 like aging James Randi \u2014 can\u2019t exactly push their\nway to the front of the crowd. And the people who are convinced that\ntheir topic is the most important for everyone to go to are usually\ndeathly boring.\n\nHow would I do it? First, I would put a few words of description on\npeople\u2019s badges and wall-cards. Second, I would put the wall-cards\nonline. (They\u2019re digital photos anyway.) Third, during the name\nintroductions I\u2019d point a video camera at the person introducing\nthemselves and project it onto the big screen up front so that people\ndon\u2019t flip around their chairs and crane to see.\n\nBut the main thing I\u2019d do is make people pitch for their sessions. There\nare a bunch of different ways to do this, but the one I like best at the\nmoment (and thus the one I\u2019d try first) is to hand out PRS devices to\nthe audience (these are little hand-held gadgets that send an IR pulse\nto a computer at the front of the room recording a vote on something)\nand then have all the people who want to hold a session form a line\ngoing towards the back of the room. Each person in the line gets 30\nseconds to pitch their session. If people like it, they press a button\non the PRS and their vote gets recorded. After the pitch, someone enters\nthe presenter name, the session name, and the estimated length into the\ncomputer recording the votes. (If someone in the line wants to hold a\nsimilar session, they can consult with the person pitching and merge\nthings.)\n\nOnce every session has been pitched, the computer does a constraint\noptimization problem to schedule only the most popular sessions in\ntimeslots with the least conflicts (the computer knows if a person wants\nto see both James Randi and Eugenie Scott, so it can try to avoid having\nthem speak at the same time) and place them in rooms with the\nappropriate amount of space. This schedule is printed up and placed on\nthe website, maybe with a few spots reserved for last-minute changes,\nand this is what people follow.\n\nAside from being a really sexy use of constraint optimization, this\nsolves a lot of problems: people get a little taste of every session,\nthe most interesting sessions are scheduled, conflicts (wanting to see\ntwo sessions that are scheduled to the same time) are minimized, rooms\nare allocated by audience size instead of by ego size. If you want, you\ncan even print up a schedule for each participant, with the computer\ntelling them which is the session they liked most at every timeslot.\n\nBuying [a bunch of PRSs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response)\ncan\u2019t be that expensive \u2014 for comparison, Google purchased two nights at\na hotel for every guest \u2014 and you can reuse them every year. If giving\npeople a chance to pitch their sessions takes too long, you can have\nthem submit a one paragraph description to a web site and let people\nvote on the web site. If this requires too many attendees have laptops\nwith them, you can have them do this before the conference. But that\nrequires more foresight than I expect the average attendee has, which is\nwhy I like the PRS system. I\u2019m not sure why O\u2019Reilly sticks to paper.\n\n**Update:** By email, [Peter\nKazanjy](http://thesecomefromtrees.blogspot.com/) suggests another\nvariation: have people write their session ideas up on cards, put the\ncards on the wall, then have everyone make a mark on their top five\nideas, then schedule the cards and rooms based on how many marks they\nhave.\n", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response", "http://thesecomefromtrees.blogspot.com/"], "time": 1186297200.0, "postid": "foofix", "internal_links": []}, "scifoo07": {"post_title": "Sci Foo 2007 Gossip Liveblog", "tags": [], "post_content": "Sci Foo 2007 Gossip Liveblog\n============================\n\nAugust 4, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/scifoo07)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Industry heavyweights [O\u2019Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/),\n[Google](http://www.google.com/), and [Nature](http://www.nature.com/)\ncome together to sponsor a science-focused version of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s runaway\nsuccess [FOO Camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp), bringing\ntogether top people in the field to eat and gab and plot.

[Daniel\nChudnov](http://onebiglibrary.net/bio) of the Library of Congress\nintroduces himself and tells me about the ten terabytes of data they\nhave at [Chronicling America](http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/).\n[Brady Forrest](http://radar.oreilly.com/brady/) tells me about the many\nconferences he worries about.\n\n### Saturday\n\n[Martha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart) saw one of her\nsubordinates eat food that\u2019s been out too long and worried that she\nwould die of salmonella. [Vaughan\nBell](http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/?go=10947) tells me what\nit\u2019s like to study people with psychosis and delusions. A group at\nbreakfast wonders who is the Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan of our era.\nCSI has driven so many people into forensics that colleges have started\nwhole new programs because of it \u2014 can we do the same for the rest of\nscience? \u201cScience shows always show us at the university all day,\u201d one\ncomplains. \u201cHow come they never show us at the pub or at meetings like\nthis?\u201d\n\nIn one session a group of people discuss their citizen science projects\n\u2014 attempts to let normal people assist them with science. Others talk\nabout visualizing data and transporting huge swaths of it. Google\nsecurity is frighteningly helpful. [Danny\nHillis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis) talks in the hallway\nabout buying land for his clock. [Jeff\nHawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins) talks about his\nneocortical theory. [Eugenie\nScott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenie_Scott) speaks on the attacks\non evolution. [Henry Gee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gee) on the\nJewish community in London: \u201cPeople are shocked if their rabbi is not a\npracticing lesbian.\u201d\n\nI signed up to give a talk.\n\nAt lunch there was a fellow working on genetically evolving robots,\nusing a 3D printer to make the robots. Zach Kaplan of\n[Inventables](http://www.inventables.com/) had a big bag at the table,\nfrom which he kept pulling out the most amazing things \u2014 squishy\nmagnets, plastic that expands in water, instant snow, erasable pens, and\nso on. It was hilariously fun. On the way back in my old friend [Chris\nAnderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_%28writer%29) said\nhi and plugged his new startup with the inimitable [Adam\nGoldstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldstein_(author)),\n[BookTour](http://booktour.com/). Adam \u2014 say hi sometime!\n\nTheo Gray [demoes Mathematica 6](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/).\n[Ted Kaehler](http://weather-dimensions.com/tedkaehler/us/ted/), a\nlieutenant of [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), demoes\nthe latest stuff from [Squeakland](http://squeakland.org/), which has\nsimilar demos but for kids and with less elegance. ([Dean\nKamen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen) got very interested;\npresumably for [FIRST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST).) [Bj\u00f8rn\nLomborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg) takes his\n[Copenhagen\nConsensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Consensus) show on\nthe road. Hugh Reinhoff tells how he diagnosed his daughter\u2019s congenital\nillness by sequencing her DNA to find the genetic mutation. (Harvard\ncharges only \\$3.50 a reaction!) \u201cAll the stuff you need these days is\navailable on the Web,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut the doctors get totally freaked\nout.\u201d\n\nThe Google buildings are almost mazelike.\n\n[George\nDyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dyson_%28science_historian%29)\nhas a standing-room-only talk on \u201cG\u00f6del and the Draft Board\u201d. (It was\nalready moved to a larger room once.) The rest of [the Dyson\nfamily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson) and [Martin\nRees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees), President of the Royal\nSociety, are among the numerous in attendance. George Dyson gives a\nmadcap tour of G\u00f6del\u2019s attempts to become a full professor at the\n[Institute for Advanced\nStudy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study) \u2014 a\nstory of endless disappointments which Dyson manages to make quite\nfunny. It\u2019s brilliant, if you can look past his standard bits of\nsoftheadedness. [Freeman\nDyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson) pipes in with stories\nfrom his [Neal Stephenson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)\nnotes that G\u00f6del went on to work on lonely philosophical projects and\nGeorge suggests that the open-ended freedom of the Institute was a bit\nof a mistake. [Tim\nO\u2019Reilly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Reilly) wonders if this\nis a more general lesson. \u201cI once paid [Larry\nWall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) a salary to do \u2026\nbasically whatever he wanted for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that it was\nthe worst thing that ever happened to the Perl community, because that\nwas when [Perl 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6) turned into what\nsomeone called a performance art project.\u201d\n\nMartha Stewart fills a big room speaking on the Paperless Home. \u201cI may\nnot look like it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m the typical homemaker. I have a\ndog, I have a daughter, I have a garden, I have a farm, and I do\u2014or I\ndid it all myself.\u201d And as a homemaker, she\u2019s convinced homes need to\nbecome computerized. Not too computerized, of course \u2014 not like those\ncrazy folks at MIT who want to have refrigerators that talk and coffee\nmakers that do the same thing every day. Stewart wants to preserve\ntraditions too. So she\u2019s going to build tools to organize the\nultra-tedious tasks of life. She\u2019s very bright, hard-headed, and\nengaging. \u201cSo exhausting,\u201d says one woman upon the session\u2019s conclusion.\n\u201cWe pay people to do that sort of work.\u201d\n\n[Dalton Conley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Conley), the\npersecuted sociologist, and his arthack wife [Natalie\nJeremijenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Jeremijenko) gab at\ndinner. Dean Kamen gesticulates wildly and talks about watching\nbeautiful women who bend down to pick things up. Nat Torkington\ndiscusses how O\u2019Reilly refused to censor [his video demonstration of New\nZealand\nculture](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/07/why_imovie_shou.html).\n[Chris DiBona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona) admits he just\nworks at Google (as a grown-up!) so that he can do science tourism. Theo\nGray shows me the 3D Table of the Elements he printed out using a\nlenticular.\n\nThe Internet here is really wonky.\n\n[Timo Hannay](http://www.connotea.org/wiki/User:timo) of *Nature*\nintroduces himself and welcomes me, giving some clues as to why I was\ninvited. He asks me to explain [Science that\nMatters](http://sciencethatmatters.com/), which is an odd situation. My\nproud co-author [Jim\nHendler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler) gives a talk on the\nfuture of science publishing. [Paul\nGinsparg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg) ducks out to look\nat [Howtoons](http://www.howtoons.com/), where [Saul\nGriffith](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~saul/), who is dating Tim\u2019s\ndaughter [Arwen\nO\u2019Reilly](http://www.makezine.com/pub/au/Arwen_O_Reilly), explains that\nthey try to combine emotional stories to attract girls and action at a\ndistance (guns, explodey-things, etc.) to attract boys, and telling the\nreal stories behind discoveries to attract all. Theo Gray talks about\nthe liability issues involved in publishing [his Popular Science\ncolumn](http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/PopularScience/index.html).\nThey made sure to get [Judith\nRegan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Regan) as their publisher so\nthat they could print all sorts of dangerous stuff in their book, only\nto have her sacked because of the [O.J. Simpson\ndebacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I_Did_It). The conversation\nthen devolved into explodey-things you can make at home. But [the\nbook](http://books.theinfo.org/go/006076158X) should be out soon. It\nlooks great.\n\nThe WiFi at the conference hotel [adds ads to\npages](http://vancouver.cs.washington.edu/). Wow, is that annoying.\n\n### Sunday\n\n[Eric Bonabeau](http://www.icosystem.com/about_management.htm)\napologized for being rude to me the other day and explained what his\ncompany does \u2014 predict human behavior based on modeling cognitive\nbiases. \u201cClearly people aren\u2019t rational economic actors,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cJust look at [Quinn\nNorton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton).\u201d\n\nSomeone whose name I didn\u2019t catch talks about finding which genetic\ndifferences increase your risk for getting a particular disease. To get\n1x coverage of your genome from [Celera](http://www.celera.com/) costs\nonly \\$100,000 and [23andMe](http://www.23andme.com/) hopes to do\nportions of your gene for \\$1,000. And just doing portions costs tens of\ndollars. You can [browse the genome](http://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/)\nof [Jim Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson) and find\nthe genetic mutations unique to him. \u201cPerhaps that mutation explains the\n*extreme* sexism,\u201d jokes [Paul\nGinsparg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg). He shows [a large\nstudy of genetic risk\nfactsors](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7145/full/nature05911.html)\nand examines Watson to see if he\u2019s at risk.\n\n[I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) give my talk. When I\nstart, about 4 people are there, but I charge ahead and 15 or so more\npeople show up. I give a demo of [Open\nLibrary](http://demo.openlibrary.org/), which most people miss because\nthey came late. Then we discuss how to open the scientific literature.\nGinsparg says that studies have found that about a third of all papers,\npreferentially high-impact papers, are available for free online. We\nlearn about the ways people keep online bibliographies (including the\nDrupal modules involved). And someone else suggests that the [Wellcome\nTrust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust) just buy Elsevier\nand open it up.\n\n[Natalie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Jeremijenko) helps\n[Dalton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Conley) set up his computer\nfor their joint session, in which they make \u201csomewhat opposite\narguments\u201d. (They look much less cool when they\u2019re wearing casual\nclothing.) He covers the problems in studying [his book on birth\norder](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375713816). He shows that blacks who\nwere called for the draft are less likely to die in later years (\u201cwhich\nI was shocked about\u201d), which he proposes is because the military is the\nmost color-blind institution (he suggests the black-white test score gap\nis smaller there too). He notes that women\u2019s groups prefer the voting\nrecords of politicians with daughters (for a potential natural\nexperiment). Roommate lottery finds that each point loss in GPA costs\nyou .25 points and that roommate drinking is a major influence. But once\nthe effects are known, people adjust their social behavior. Thus social\nscientists are on a treadmill. [Carl\nBergstrom](http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/) says he sees similar\npatterns in evolution \u2014 even if the animals are at a draw, you can see\nif the genome is under heavy selection.\n\nNatalie talks about her [Urban Space Station\nproject](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/xdesign/uss/) which uses closed\nsystems engineering to create safe urban spaces. Attached she\u2019ll have a\nlab, one project of which is the Environmental Health Clinic, where\npeople come with environmental problems and get prescriptions for things\nto do to help improve their world. One prescription: [the\ngreenlight](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/xdesign/greenlight/).\n\nI wanted to get into a fight with Dalton about the metareliability of\nthese natural experiments but couldn\u2019t find him \u2014 he and Natalie were\ntoo busy taking care of two adorable children. At lunch I explained Open\nLibrary to some folks from *Nature*, then got involved in a discussion\nmaking fun of Stephen Wolfram with Chris DiBona and others. I learned\nthe meaning of my Google New York shirt. Jim McBride told me how much he\nliked STM (which I saw on some other peoples\u2019 feed readers) and invited\nme up to their abandoned air traffic control tower. Paul Ginsparg\nintroduced me to [Michael Kurtz](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~kurtz/) of\n[ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/).\n\nTim gives the closing speech: he wants to hear what new connections were\nmade, that\u2019s his metric for success. Afterwards, I get in a great\nconversation with Carl Bergstrom who tells me about new features on his\n[Eigenfactor](http://eigenfactor.org/) site. Then I bump into [Bj\u00f8rn\nLomborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg), who is amazed\nI know about the Copenhagen Consensus. He\u2019s been giving copies of his\nnew book to everyone within throwing distance and stops to amicably\npersuade me that we should spend less on stopping global warming.\nIncredibly friendly guy \u2014 imagine the lead of *Thank You For Smoking*\nbut a surfer. I talked to a lot of other people but I don\u2019t remember the\ndetails.\n\nThe Google people are packing up the camping tents and mats. [Tamara\nMunzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/) demoes some of her visualization\nsoftware. She gave me and others a ride. [Ezez\nLieberman](http://www.erez.com/) told me about his work modeling\nversions of evolution in which strucural forces cause random drift to\ntie with fitness selection and his wife Aviva Presser told me about her\nwork investigating methilation in gene sequences.\n\nIt was an incredible conference. Probably the best I\u2019ve been to\n(although that\u2019s not saying much).\n\n### More\u2026\n\nView [photos on Flickr](http://flickr.com/search/?q=scifoo&s=rec).\n\nAlso, be sure to check out [my

done. At its\nworst, this stuff is boring to do. And even at its best it\u2019s hard to\ndescribe and not much fun to hear. On the plane here I wrote a memoir\nabout my time with the W3C and what was striking was not just that I\nomitted all the technical stuff from the story but that I don\u2019t even\nremember the technical stuff. People stuff, on the other hand\u2026\n\nSo I\u2019ve been holed up by myself in this elegant MIT dorm room. ([more\nphotos](http://www.figure-ground.com/travel/image.php?simmons) ([my\nfavorite](http://www.figure-ground.com/travel/image.php?simmons/0029)))\nJessica (formerly 4 of 4 from Y Combinator, the group that\u2019s funding the\nstartup I\u2019m working on) stopped by to drop off a lifesaving air\nconditioner and we chatted for a bit. I get out once or twice a day to\ngo get food at someplace nearby. And at nights I sleep. But most of the\ntime I just work.\n\nY Combinator has weekly meetings where all the startups go over to their\noffices for dinner. I missed last week\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have a dorm\nand so when I get there I don\u2019t recognize anyone. I sort of wander\naround alone trying not to look too stupid, which is what I normally do\nat parties anyway.\n\nAt some point we sit down at a long table with benches that they\u2019ve\nplaced in the room, which looks even nicer than before, with elegantly\nplaced lights and abstract art on the walls. During some pre-dinner\nconversation someone makes a pun. \u201cYou know, I read somewhere that bad\npuns are highly correlated with IQ,\u201d Paul says. \u2018I find that hard to\nbelieve,\u2019 responds a founder, \u2018I know some people who make lots of puns\nand, well\u2026\u2019 \u2018Correlations aren\u2019t perfect,\u2019 responds another. \u2018And IQ\nisn\u2019t necessarily correlated with intelligence,\u2019 comments Paul. I was\nreally glad to see he\u2019d [backed off this\nclaim](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html#footnote2). (I was thinking\nabout chiming in but I was at the very edge of the table and planning to\nsave my disagreements until after the money is in the bank.)\n\nThey plan to get a guest speaker each dinner; this week it was a patent\nattorney, who admitted that patents were expensive and not very useful\nto a startup he suggested (and cited a study that argued) they would be\nuseful later on. He gave us all packets and branded cell phone holders\nbut I forgot to take mine home.\n\nAfterwards there was more talking. One group of founders described their\nhistory. \u2018Well, we haven\u2019t really done any legitimate businesses\nbefore,\u2019 they said. \u2018What illegitimate businesses have you done?\u2019 I\nasked. \u2018Oh, adult entertainment, student term papers \u2014 nothing illegal\nbut not the sort of things you want to show to VCs!\u2019\n\nI got to talk to rtm which was really wonderful and at some point I\nfound myself in a conversation with Paul and a couple other people. Paul\nasked me if I could send him a copy of [the infamous\npaper](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/sneakpeek) and another person\nchimed in \u2018oh you\u2019re definitely sending me a copy.\u2019 \u2018Wait, you know\nabout this?\u2019 asked Paul. \u2018You don\u2019t?\u2019 replied the third person. It\nturned out everyone there had read my blog. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Paul, \u2018I only\nstarted reading it when it started mentioning *me*!\u2019\n\nNot long afterward a group of people behind me pulled me away and\nintroduced themselves. \u2018And who are you?\u2019 they asked. Paul, from behind\nme, said \u2018this is *Aaron Swartz*; you don\u2019t know who *Aaron Swartz* is?\nHe co-authored RSS!\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the kid, \u2018well then you made me quite a\nbit of money!\u2019\n\nAt some point Jessica pulled me aside to go over the legal paperwork of\nwhich there is quite a bit.\n\nA group of Russian kids offered to drive me home in their van. \u2018We\u2019re\nactually agents from the KGB,\u2019 they explained, laughing, in their thick\nRussian accents, \u2018we were sent here to spy on you. We bought a van\nbecause we were told all Americans drive vans. We try to blend in.\u2019 They\ncertainly made the most of it, swerving back and forth across the street\nand making crazy turns.

If someone told you that you should\nstart a business where basically no one is in charge of anything and\neveryone shares ownership of everything and all decisions are made by\nconsensus, you\u2019d think they were a hopeless utopian about to get a large\ndose of reality. Yet that\u2019s pretty much what Wikipedia is.\n\nThere\u2019s the obvious anarchism of wikis: namely, \u201canyone can edit\u201d. No\nintelligence tests or approval rules or even a temporary probation.\nAnyone can just wander up and hit that edit button and get started.\nWhere in the world can a random person get a larger audience?\n\nThat\u2019s pretty radical in itself, but things go much deeper. There\u2019s no\nownership over text. If you write something, as soon as you post it to\nWikipedia, it\u2019s no longer \u201cyours\u201d in any real sense. Others will modify\nand mangle it without a second thought and anyone who quotes those words\nin the future will attribute them to \u201cWikipedia\u201d and not to you. In a\nculture where directors are suing people for fastforwarding over the\nsmutty scenes in their movies, that\u2019s pretty wild.\n\nAnd while there are a few technical tricks to give some people more\nsoftware features than others, for the most part the Wikipedia community\nis pretty flat. Every non-edit decision, from which pages get deleted to\nwhat the logo in the corner is, gets made by consensus with everyone\ngetting a chance to have their say.\n\nIn real life, few people are willing to take such a radical stand. Even\nthe farthest reaches of the far left hold back from proposing such\nextreme ideas, suggesting that not only that such extreme freedom\nwouldn\u2019t fly in a capitalist culture like ours, but that perhaps some of\nthese restrictions are just necessary because of human nature. But it\u2019s\nhumans who edit Wikipedia, and mostly humans raised in capitalist\nculture as well. Perhaps it\u2019s time to give more extremism a chance.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1165824000.0, "postid": "wikianarchism", "internal_links": []}, "bandwagon": {"post_title": "Bandwagon", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bandwagon\n=========\n\nFebruary 17, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bandwagon)\n\n* * * * *\n\nA new service called [Bandwagon](http://ridethebandwagon.com/) is\nlaunching soon that automatically backs up the music libraries of iTunes\nusers to Amazon S3 for a flat rate.

The trip was a lot of fun, but at one\npoint I found myself completely out of cash, my ATM/debit card snapped\nin half, my credit card deactivated for suspected fraud, and my phone\nout of batteries. Then I got off at the wrong subway stop and found\nmyself deep in the wrong part of Harlem.\n\nAs scary as that was, it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as frightening as the\nexistential terror I feel every day walking the streets of San\nFrancisco.\n\nWhen I walked through the streets of Manhattan, I saw residents going\nfor a stroll or walking their dog or playing with their kids and I\nthought \u201cAh, I could live here\u201d. But even while I\u2019m living in San\nFrancisco I still can\u2019t quite believe it can be done. I saw a mother out\nwalking with her daughter and thought \u201cWhat are you doing?! Don\u2019t you\nknow this is no place for a child?\u201d\n\nThe whole city feels like some sort of movie set; oversized and fake.\nEvery time I go out I worry that I might miss my mark or fumble my lines\nand on the rare occasions that I do, I am mercilessly excoriated by the\ncity officials. When New Yorkers bark at you for screwing up, it\u2019s\nbecause they\u2019re impatient. But San Franciscans seem to do it much more\nfrequently and with much more emotion. You\u2019re not just wasting my time,\ntheir tone of voice says, you\u2019re insulting me with your stupidity.\n\nI\u2019ve been to San Francisco before, of course, but always on very\ncarefully planned excursions. Go to this place, take this subway, get\noff here. I realized after I moved here that this was the first day I\u2019d\nreally woken up in the city and it was terrifying. I ran down the street\nto catch my train to work and (after getting barked at by city employees\nfor waiting in the wrong place) found the train packed to the edges,\nwith barely enough space for me to stand.\n\nThe city maltreats you even when you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. I\ntried to take a bus from the place I was staying to downtown one night\nand, after everyone else got off at earlier stops, the bus driver\nnoticed I was the only one left in the bus and kicked me out before he\u2019d\nfinished the route. \u201cYeah, this is the last stop now,\u201d he said. \u201cGet\nout.\u201d\n\nOf course the downtown district is a den of filth and vice, shops with\nnames like \u201cTenderloin Liquors\u201d and \u201cAdult Show Superstore\u201d with gangs\nof leering indigents sitting on every streetcorner. In Harlem, people\nmostly kept their eyes down and kept walking. Here everyone calls out to\nme, like a dark postapocalyptic scene from *Blade Runner* or *A.I.*.\n\nOf course, San Francisco isn\u2019t all pain. Every time I begin to think\nit\u2019s too much to bear and that I have to get out of town now, it does\nsome little thing to redeem itself. I\u2019m spit on by every drunk and\ntransit worker, rained on from the entirely cloud-covered sky, splashed\non by the busses refusing to follow their routes, but then I\u2019m\nwonderfully treated by the staff of the soaring San Francisco Library\nand then I\u2019m cheerful again until the next guy spits in my face.\n\nOne night, the friend I\u2019m staying with invited me to go with her to San\nFrancisco\u2019s Midnight Riders and lent me a bike to do so. The bike was a\nroad bike, which I didn\u2019t know how to use, and I didn\u2019t have a helmet.\nWe sped down hills as I peddled furiously and met up with a group of\ndrunk people (some of whom were also on cocaine) carrying axes (the\ntheme was \u201cI Married an Axe Murderer\u201d) as we sped around the city,\nculminating at the pier, where some of them stripped down and jumped\ninto the freezing water.\n\nAfter that terrifying night, San Francisco didn\u2019t really scare me\nanymore, but it still felt wrong. Perhaps a movie set is a fairly safe\nplace to actually be, but when you live on-stage it\u2019s difficult to get\nany privacy. Having to live my life on stage in this dark, cartoony,\nmask-filled world seems like a more terrifying nightmare than anything\nan axe-wielding gang of cocaine-high bikers could do.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1163491200.0, "postid": "sfterror", "internal_links": []}, "robertwalker": {"post_title": "Robert Walker, Road Warrior", "tags": [], "post_content": "Robert Walker, Road Warrior\n===========================\n\nNovember 8, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/robertwalker)\n\n* * * * *\n\nRobert Walker was the consummate road warrior. A decade out of college,\nbut still single, his job as a salesman required him to spend his days\ntraveling the country, making his pitch before assembled audiences of\nrespected businessmen. Robert had never been one to get too attached to\nany place or person, he enjoyed the life on the road, remaking himself\nin every new location.\n\nSince he had no one to come home to, he threw himself into his work,\nvolunteering to take more and more days on the road, until the road\nitself became his home. Every place he went looked the same after all:\nthe same white airports, the same chain stores, the same business types\nin the same suits. He felt he was getting to know \u201cthe neighborhood\u201d and\ndeveloped a routine: Wake up at the Westin in the morning, grab a coffee\nat Starbucks, head to the office to make a pitch, grab lunch at a\nCheesecake Factory or a Chili\u2019s, do another pitch at an office, then\ncatch a plane to the next Westin.\n\nChain culture became his culture. Aside from the commute by airplane, it\ncould easily pass for just another job. He eventually let the lease on\nhis apartment lapse, his suitcase becoming his only possessions. Soon he\ngot rid of that too, adding the task of picking up a new pair of clothes\nas Banana Republic to his nighttime rituals. He felt freer, knowing that\nno matter where he went, the world would provide him with all his\nfavorite things. All he had to do was show his credit card.\n\nHe realized the credit card was the only part of the wallet he was using\n\u2014 it got him his e-tickets at the airport, paid for his clothing and his\nmeals, reserved the room at his hotels \u2014 so he chucked the rest of the\nwallet and carried only that. He decided to chuck his cell phone too \u2014\nhe had the head office call him every morning to tell him where he was\nto pitch to next.\n\nNow he truly felt alive. A man with a card \u2014 that was all he was \u2014 yet\nthe world bowed before him, ministering to his every want. The people he\ninteracted with started to seem different to him. No longer were they\nsimply service workers, doing their job to get their pay. Now they\nseemed like *servants*, bowing before him in obeisance to his power.\n\u201cHave a nice flight, Mr. Parker\u201d, \u201cEnjoy your meal!\u201d, \u201cThank you, sir\u201d \u2014\nit all now sounded like genuine emotion to him.

The world had finally come to love him.\nThe parents who never supported him, the girls who\u2019d quickly abandoned\nhim, the friends who were never there for him \u2014 well, he now had the\nlast laugh. The world now catered to his every whim, fitting his desires\nlike a well-tailored glove. And all he had to do to get it?

In the early part of the 1900s,\nhospitals became fanatical about sterility, to prevent infection. Each\ninfant in their care, for example, had its own white coat for doctors to\nwear as they visited that infant, hung on hooks inside out for the next\ndoctor to don. Holding babies was considered dangerous (as signage\nemphasized), so they were fed without being held \u2014 bottles were simply\npropped up where the infants could get at them. Needless to say, parents\nwere denied visits.\n\nAnd yet mortality rates for infants in hospital care ranged from 30 to\n75 percent. The babies were cared for and nourished, they had no outward\nphysical problems, they simply succumbed to a mysterious phenomenon the\ndoctors labeled \u201cfailure to thrive\u201d. Some thought it might be a hidden\ninfection.\n\nSo the nurses wore masks and hoods, carefully scrubbed up before they\nhandled infants. Some hospitals put infants in boxes with glove-valves \u2014\nthe kinds you see in movies when scientists are handling radioactive\nmaterial \u2014 so that they\u2019d never have to touch the infant at all. But the\nproblem just got worse.\n\nHenry Bakwin, pediatric director of New York\u2019s Bellevue Hospital, saw\nthis and thought that perhaps they were going about things exactly\nwrong. The infants weren\u2019t dying of infection, he believed, they were\ndying of loneliness \u2014 a loneliness that made it easier for them to\nsuccumb to infection. He took down the signs about washing hands and put\nup signs requiring everyone to pick up and fondle a baby. And infection\nrates went down.\n\nHarold Skeels and a team at the Iowa Child Research Welfare Station\ndecided to try an experiment. They took thirteen girls out of\ninstitutionalized care and had them \u201cadopted\u201d by older girls in \u201ca home\nfor the feeble-minded\u201d. Within nineteen months, the average IQs of the\nadopted kids jumped from 64 to 92.\n\nBut these folks were the radicals. The mainstream scientific community\nrefused to believe there was anything wrong \u2014 people were blowing things\nout of proportion, they insisted, and anyway, everyone knows children\nthat young can\u2019t suffer from depression. The studies were flawed.\n\nJohn Bowlby came at it from a different perspective. Interviewing\nseverely disturbed kids, he discovered they all shared a traumatic\nseparation from their parents when they were young. He concluded the\nmother-infant relationship was essential to development and issued\nrecommendations much like Skeels and Spitz. \u201cThe mothering of a child is\nnot something which can be arranged by roster,\u201d he wrote in reports for\nthe World Health Organization. But still the hospitals didn\u2019t change.\n\nBowlby\u2019s student John Robertson begun doing observation at hospitals. He\nnoticed that babies screamed painfully as they were admitted. The nurses\nexplained that this was normal and they\u2019d soon settle down. He noticed\nthat these \u201csettled\u201d babies returned to violent fits when they were\ntaken home, attacking her as if they blamed her. The nurses said that\nwas normal too, mothers weren\u2019t just as good at taking care of kids as\nthe nurses. Robertson had a different explanation.\n\nHe decided to make a movie to prove it. Unlike the last, this one would\nbe completely scientific. He would pick a name at random from the list\nof babies, then always film them at a specific hour, clock in the\nbackground, so you could tell he wasn\u2019t cheating. The name he picked was\nLaura.\n\nWhen he went to find her he was devastated: Laura was the one girl in a\nhundred who wasn\u2019t crying; her parents had reared her so strictly that\nshe quietly restrained all her emotions. \u201cI saw immediately [she] was\ngoing to be the one child in a hundred who was not going to demonstrate\nwhat I had been shouting my head off [about],\u201d Robertson said. But he\ncouldn\u2019t pick another child \u2014 that would be cheating. The project\ncontinued.\n\nThe first day, Laura jumped out of her bath to the door in an attempt to\nescape. Her smiles disappear and sometimes she quietly sobs while\nclutching her teddy. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mummy?\u201d she asks repeatedly, while\ntrying hard to hold back tears. Each day she grows grayer until on the\nfifth, when she appears unsmiling and resentful. Her mother comes to\nvisit (thanks to a special exception to the rules Robertson negotiated),\nbut she wipes away her mother\u2019s kiss. When her mother waves goodbye, she\nlooks away. When her mother finally comes to take her home on the eight\nday, she begins shaking with sobs. She gathers up all of her stuff, but\nrefuses to take her mother\u2019s hand as they walk out.\n\nThey presented the film to the Royal Society of Medicine in London. The\naudience was outraged. It was false, it was slander, it was a trick, it\nwas an atypical child, it was filmed selectively, it was edited\ndishonestly. \u201cPeople stood up and said that their children\u2019s wards were\nnot like that, two-year-olds were all happy,\u201d Robertson recalls.\nRobertson was banned from some of the wards he was observing,\npediatricians walked across the street when they encountered him. The\nhospital claimed that Robertson had interfered with the nurses trying to\ncare for Laura. As Robertson toured Britain with the film, the reaction\nwas always the same.\n\nWhen Laura finally saw the film, six months later, she burst into tears.\n\u201cWhere were you all that time?\u201d she asked her mother.\n\nReviews in the medical journals, however, were all positive. And younger\nnurses and doctors begun telling Robertson how they agreed with him and\nwould do things differently, if only they were in charge. And a few\nhigher-ups quietly sent some votes of support. So Robertson kept going.\nHe took the film to the United States, hoping for a similarly positive\nreception. But the Americans insisted that while it was a great film\nabout Britain, it had no relevance in their country. And nobody was\nwilling to take the obvious step of letting mothers stay with their\nchildren on the wards.\n\nNot until 1955 were there signs of change. Fred Stone, a doctor at the\nRoyal Hospital in Glasgow, decided to do a pilot study. \u201cI would drive\nup the hill to come here,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand there would be two hundred\nparents queueing up in the rain to get in for their half hour\u2019s\nvisiting.\u201d A colleague who had control of two pediatric wards decided to\noffer one of them to Stone to prove that his suggestions wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nWhen the nurses heard about this, they threatened to resign together. To\nplacate them, Stone set up a series of meetings. \u201cThe aggression after\nthe first meetings was unbelievable, truly unbelievable,\u201d he explained.\nBut the aggression soon turned to tears. \u201cThey said, \u2018You don\u2019t\nunderstand what you are asking of us. [You mean] a parent can just walk\nin and see how we\u2019re neglecting these poor kids[?]\u2019 [\u2026] And, of course,\nat that point we had to say, \u2018But what on earth makes you think that\nwe\u2019re criticizing you? You\u2019re doing an impossible job remarkably well.\u2019\nAnd, of course, then the tears came as you can imagine.\u201d Finally they\nagreed the experiment should at least be tried.\n\n\u201cI never heard any more about the issue at all. Nobody ever came back to\nme and said, \u2018The six months are up.\u2019 Nobody ever reported that it had\nbeen a success or a failure; all I knew was that somehow I heard that\ntwo wards were doing it, four wards were doing it, the whole hospital\nwas doing it. And since then we\u2019ve had almost unrestricted visiting in\nthe whole hospital.\u201d\n\nSimilar experiments were conducted in London, although changes on the\nContinent didn\u2019t happen until the late 1970s. In 1959, the British\nminister of health made it official policy. And in the early 1960s,\nRobertson told BBC Radio parents that they should sit-in by their\nchildren\u2019s cot and force the hospital to try to evict them. Slowly the\ntide began to turn.\n\n*This article is based on Robert Karen\u2019s tour de force book* [Becoming\nAttached](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015).\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015"], "time": 1159254000.0, "postid": "hospitalbabies", "internal_links": []}, "losingweight": {"post_title": "On Losing Weight", "tags": [], "post_content": "On Losing Weight\n================\n\nJuly 26, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/losingweight)\n\n* * * * *\n\nExactly three months ago, [I wrote about the Shangri-La\nDiet](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/miraclediet). While I started on it\nbasically immediately, it wasn\u2019t until exactly two months ago that I got\na scale to measure my weight with (so some data has been lost). Since I\ngot the scale, however, I\u2019ve lost over twenty pounds.\n\nShockingly, losing weight has to be one of the easiest things I\u2019ve ever\ndone. I simply don\u2019t eat unless I\u2019m really hungry and then I eat as\nlittle as possible (a couple crackers, for example). Most days I just\nhave a couple crackers in the evening. It saves time and money and\nhassle (and makes it easy to eat healthy) and while I do get some weird\nlooks from friends at restaurants, always being a fussy eater that\u2019s\nnothing new. (Furthermore, [there\u2019s some\nevidence](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/06/22/meal-skipping-good-or-bad/)\nthat not eating significantly prolongs lifespan.)\n\nThe one thing that really did surprise me is that [while I predicted\nthere would be strong social pressures to lose\nweight](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fatfuture), in reality all the\npressure seemed to go the other way. Friends and acquaintances urge me\nto eat more, doctors think I\u2019m sick, family members suggest I have an\neating disorder. Part of this is probably just due to novelty: While\n\u201ceat less\u201d is standard advice for losing weight, because we all have set\npoints no one is actually able to pull it off. Thus when someone\nactually does losing weight by eating less, it\u2019s usually because they\nreally are sick or something like that. But in my darker moments, I\nwonder if part of it is selfish. The extraordinarily thin people\nencouraging me to eat more, I darkly wonder, don\u2019t want me to be like\nthem. The people who need to lose some weight don\u2019t like the example of\nmy success. I don\u2019t like thinking this way, and I have no evidence for\nit, but it\u2019s hard to resist.\n\nThere\u2019s not much more to say; food is even less a part of my life than\nit was before. I still plan to lose more weight and will provide further\nupdates accordingly. Still, since many people seem to be interested in\nthe topic (and in keeping with the theme of my blog), a diary of my\nthree months follows.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the burping. When losing weight, it seems\nyou burp quite a bit. But even worse is the feeling of *wanting* to\nburp. The olive oil, it seems, has inflated my stomach with gas, making\nme desperately want to burp, but I can\u2019t. In fact, it was so painful\nthat I decided to stop taking the olive oil. I still ate less \u2014 it seems\nlike once the olive oil lowered my set point, it was easy to keep things\noff from there. There were a couple days after eating lots where I would\nfeel hungry for long periods of time and had to ignore it, but if I did\nthat for a whole day, my set point went down, just like with the olive\noil.\n\nI [went back home](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/suburbia) and saw some\nold friends at my high school\u2019s graduation. Many of them commented on\nhow thin I was. I was kind of surprised, because I didn\u2019t think I was\nnoticeably thinner yet, but I have to say I enjoyed the compliment.\nWhile on this vacation I told myself I\u2019d forget the diet and would eat\nall the good home foods I missed. But even doing this, I couldn\u2019t gain\nweight while on vacation. I was taken out to a nice restaurant downtown\nbut couldn\u2019t finish my hamburger (which I typically had no problem\ndoing) \u2014 when I was half way through if I took another bite I felt like\nI was going to throw up, so I just stopped. When I got back, I weighed\nbasically the same as when I\u2019d left.\n\nAs I lost more weight I began to feel better. I\u2019d look in the mirror and\nnotice the fat that had disappeared from my chest, or when lying down\nI\u2019d notice my legs were thinner. I felt like I had more energy. I felt\nhappier. I felt more mobile, more able to move around and do things now\nthat there was less of me. It felt wonderful.\n\nOne week I lost seven pounds in almost as many days and friends began to\nlook at me with concern. But I didn\u2019t mind; I thought it was great. I\nhad started eating significantly less, hardly anything at all really.\nWhen I moved into this new apartment (just as I was starting the diet),\nI thought I would have a hard time finding novel places to eat each day.\nBut it hasn\u2019t been hard at all; I\u2019ve hardly gone out to eat by myself\n*once* since I started the diet, except to treat myself to a food I\nalready knew I loved.\n\nWriting about a gastric bypass (a surgery in which the stomach is shrunk\nto help those who are extremely overweight lose weight) patient, surgeon\nAtul Gawande describes a sensation I found extremely familiar:\n\n> [\u2026] She [lost so much weight that] was unrecognizable to anyone who\n> had known her before, and even to herself. \u201cI went to bars to see if I\n> could get picked up\u2014and I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI always said no,\u201d she\n> quickly added, laughing. \u201cBut I did it anyway.\u201d\n>\n> The changes weren\u2019t just physical, though. She had slowly found\n> herself to have a profound and unfamiliar sense of willpower over\n> food. She no longer *had* to eat anything: \u201cWhenever I eat, somewhere\n> in the course of that time I end up asking myself, \u2018Is this good for\n> you? Are you going to put on weight if you eat too much of this?\u2019 And\n> I can just stop.\u201d The feeling baffled her. She knew, intellectually,\n> that the surgery was why she no longer ate as much as she used to. Yet\n> she felt as if she were choosing not to do it.\n>\n> Studies report this to be a typical experience of successful gastric\n> bypass patients. [\u2026]\n\n(Atul Gawande, *Complications*, 174)\n\nThe newfound willpower allowed me to be more conscious about my diet. I\nstarted thinking about what foods I wanted to eat and researching the\ntopic of nutrition. I read Walter Willett\u2019s book about the results of\nhis epidemiological nutrition studies and begun looking at the labels of\nboxes I ate. I begun ordering different things at restaurants when I did\neat and buying different things at the supermarket. But most of all I\nfound myself eating less.\n\nWhen this proved not to be enough, I found myself exercising. I seemed\nto be more out-of-shape now than it did when I started \u2014 I suspect with\nall the weight loss I lost some other things too \u2014 but exercising was\nprobably easier to find the motivation for now.

And political language, Geoffrey Nunberg argues in\n*Talking Right*, is the shadow cast by government. Democrats, he points\nout, seem to think language has a talismanic power, that if only they\ncan find the right catch phrase or slogan, they can pull people over to\ntheir side. \u201cLiberal\u201d must become \u201cprogressive\u201d, \u201cfamily values\u201d must\nbecome \u201cvaluing families\u201d. There\u2019s an intellectual cleverness to such\nstunts, and as a Berkeley linguist, Nunberg must want to believe in\nthem. But he doesn\u2019t. The words, he explains, are just a side-effect of\nthe larger political situation. Dewey explained that attempts to change\nthe shadow will have no effect without a change in the substance, and\nNunberg heartily agrees.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how it could be otherwise, but Democrats have suffered\nfrom a stubborn literalism in political discourse: thinking they can\nbeat the charge of big government by launching programs cutting down on\nbureaucratic waste, thinking they can reclaim the issue of values by\npointing to their love of tolerance and fairness, thinking they can\ndodge the charge of latte-sipping by donning a hunting cap and rifle. In\nreality, the issues go much deeper: big government is an attack on the\nnotion that government can do good, values refers to a feeling of\nnational morals run amok, and the latte-sipping charge is an attempt to\ndistract voters from bigger issues of class. Nunberg even chastises his\ncolleague George Lakoff for assuming that the current packages of\npolitical positions have any deeper meanings, rather than just being\naccidents of history.\n\nNunberg is an essayist\u2014his commentaries for NPR\u2019s *Fresh Air* are a\nnational treasure\u2014and his style, while eminently readable, doesn\u2019t\ntranslate well to a long book, where his points get lost in a field of\nanecdotes. But beneath all the stories about how conservatives eat more\nbrie and liberal used to be a mantle claimed by everyone, Nunberg\u2019s\npoint is a familiar one: if the Democrats want to win, they must begin\ntelling full-throated populist stories about how the economic elite are\ncapturing the wealth of our country and how we need government to take\nit back. The point is no less true for being popular, and it\u2019s\nheartening to find that investigation from yet another perspective\nyields the same conclusions.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586483862)\n\n\n[image1_talkingright]: image1_talkingright.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586483862", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586483862"], "time": 1161068400.0, "postid": "talkingright", "internal_links": []}, "unpuzzled": {"post_title": "Philosophical Puzzles Resolved", "tags": ["morality"], "post_content": "Philosophical Puzzles Resolved\n==============================\n\nMarch 8, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/unpuzzled)\n\n* * * * *\n\nPuzzle 1: Equality and Disability\n---------------------------------\n\nDaniel Wikler posed to me the following problem he encountered while\nStaff Ethicist at the WHO.^[1](#fn:fn1)^ The WHO recommends two\nprinciples: first, treat all citizens equally; second, aim to maximize\noverall quality of life. But imagine two citizens will die without a\nkidney transplant, one of whom is seriously disabled, but there is only\none kidney. The first principle requires that both have an equal chance\nof getting the kidney. But the second principle requires we give it to\nthe non-disabled person: if the disabled person dies, overall quality of\nlife in the society will be higher, since it will have one less disabled\nperson. (We accept, by definition, that disability lowers quality of\nlife.) What to do?\n\n*Response:* It seems pretty clear that the first value is simply wrong.\nWe have no interest in promoting the health of the population; the\npopulation is simply an abstraction. Our interest is in promoting the\nhealth of (the sum of) individual people, who are conscious and\ntherefore have moral interests.\n\nOne can see this clearly by looking at the cases where the population\nchanges but people do not: birth, death, exile, and immigration:\n\n**Birth:** The society has a controlled population growth program and\nassigns birth permits; birth permits are assigned to parents with the\nhealthiest genes.\n\n**Death:** The society has a limited number of organs; organs are given\nto the least-injured.\n\n**Exile:** Sick people are tossed out of the society.\n\n**Immigration:** Only healthy people are allowed to immigrate.\n\nIn all four such cases, it seems pretty clear to me that the population\nhealth position is wrong. (Exile seems particularly cruel.)\n\nPuzzle 2: The Repugnant Conclusion\n----------------------------------\n\nDerek Parfit [poses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox)\nthe following problem. 1: Imagine there are a group of happy people (A).\n2: Now imagine that some other people are created in some other\ncompletely unconnected place that are happy, but less happy than the\nprevious group (B). 3: Now imagine that both groups are adjusted to be\nat some equal, but intermediate point of happiness between A and A+. 4:\nNow imagine these two societies are connected, resulting in C: more\npeople at a lesser degree of happiness.\n\n2 is no worse than 1, since the additional people are happy and do not\naffect anyone. 3 is no worse than 2, since the people in B are made\nhappier by more than the people in A are made unhappy. 4 is no worse\nthan 3, since we are simply introducing folks to each other. But\ncontinue this and you reach the repugnant conclusion: a huge swarm of\npeople who are just barely happy is better than a handful of people who\nare extremely happy.\n\n*Response:* The problem is step 2, which is in fact worse than 1. Parfit\nassumes that simply adding extra people whose lives are worth living\ncannot make things worse. But that\u2019s ridiculous. Imagine our society,\nthen imagine our society with a bunch more feral people living on the\nhuge island of garbage in the middle of the Pacific, unable to speak\nexcept in a growl, with none of the surrounding societies ever noticing.\nI think the people living in the garbage heap\u2019s lives would be worth\nliving (I wouldn\u2019t want to kill them, nor would they want to be killed),\nbut I distinctly prefer the former society.\n\nPuzzle 3: The Logic of the Larder\n---------------------------------\n\nMany people say that we shouldn\u2019t eat animals, because that would mean\nkilling them. But for many of these animals, if they aren\u2019t going to be\nkilled and eaten, they would never be born in the first place. What if\nthe animal preferred to have a short, pleasant existence before being\nconsumed as food rather than having no existence at all? Wouldn\u2019t that\nmean we should breed the animal, give it a nice life, then kill and eat\nit?\n\n*Response:* This is a ridiculous hypothetical \u2014 you\u2019re suggesting an\nanimal that doesn\u2019t exist yet has a preference about existing. I don\u2019t\nrespect hypothetical creatures\u2019 hypothetical desires to not be\nhypothetical. If I did, you could get me to do all sorts of absurd\nthings just by hypothesizing them. You could, say, simply hypothesize a\nutility monster\u2019s very strong desire to exist and I would be morally\nbound to try to create one. Or perhaps my hypothetical children really\nwant to exist, so I have to hurry to procreate. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI think we should maximize the actual interests of actual people.\n\nPuzzle 4: Addition vs. Subtraction\n----------------------------------\n\nAs a consequentialist, if I support not adding people (as I do in my\nresolution to 2 and 3), then I must support removing people, since the\nconsequences are identical. If I prefer a society with fewer, happier\npeople, then I must support euthanizing some people to make the rest\nbetter off. Sure, there are practical questions with implementing this,\nbut philosophically, I must be in favor of eliminationism.\n\n*Response:* I am not a consequentialist about societies, I\u2019m a\nutilitarian: I think we should work toward outcomes that maximize the\ninterests of individuals.\n\nThere\u2019s a fundamental disanalogy between addition and contraction.\nAddition means creating new people with interests that didn\u2019t exist\nbefore the addition. Contraction, on the other hand, means getting rid\nof actually-existing people. I do not respect the hypothetical interests\nof hypothetical individuals to not be hypothetical, but I do respect\nreal people with real interests right now, who presumably have an\ninterest in not being gotten rid of. Thus, I support not getting rid of\npeople and not arbitrarily creating new ones.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  The problem is also discussed in F.M.

So I tried to figure out for myself. I reread my favorite books, I\nread just about [everything by David Foster\nWallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/David_Foster_Wallace_nonfiction)\nand [Robert Caro](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245), I read a lot\nof *New Yorker* articles, I got caught up on\n*[n+1](http://www.nplusonemag.com/)*. I read a lot of stuff out loud, to\nget a feel for the sound of the voice. (I performed all the brief\ninterviews (including the powerful \u201cOn His Deathbed\u2026\u201d) in *[Brief\nInterviews with Hideous\nMen](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316925195/booksinfo-20/ref=nosim/)*\n\u2014 incredible fun; I can completely see why it made John Krasinski want\nto become an actor.) In fact, it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t\nresist reading things out loud \u2014 some writing just begged to be\nperformed.\n\nI read some writing guides, but none of them were very helpful. Virginia\nTufte\u2019s *[Artful Sentences](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0961392185)* was\nby far the most interesting, but I\u2019m not sure it was much practical\nhelp. I\u2019ve had the best luck with just reading great writing and then\ntaking a stab of writing something of my own.\n\nI also tried to figure out how to structure the writing. I watched Ira\nGlass give his standard talk seven or eight different times, I read\nMamet\u2019s *On Directing Film*, I sat down with Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s\n*Outliers* and tried to take it apart and figure out how it worked. For\nsome reason, even though the basic ideas are really simple, they\u2019ve\ntaken me a really really long time to understand. It\u2019s quite odd,\nreally. I saw Ira Glass say the same thing 8 times, but only on the 7th\ntime did I walk away going \u201cOhh, that\u2019s what he means!\u201d And I keep\nhaving similar obvious epiphanies.\n\nI think part of the problem is that I was around a lot of really bad\nstorytellers as a kid. My Dad would tell a joke and it would take so\nlong that I would be tearing my hair out with boredom halfway through.\nWhen it was over I would think, \u201cWait, that was the joke? I can tell\nthat joke in two lines. What did he need all those details for?\u201d And\nsince then I\u2019ve basically been the person who tells jokes in two lines \u2014\nomitting needless words, using only the barest description, and getting\nvery impatient with people who run long (which was basically everyone,\nit seemed to me).\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve begun reading better writers or grown more patient\nwith age, but I\u2019m beginning to question this approach. Being spare and\ninteresting is better than being prolix and boring, I\u2019m still convinced,\nbut there\u2019s a place for the seemingly-irrelevant detail. For one thing,\nwhat makes a story a story is the irrelevant detail. Ira Glass\ndemonstrates this by quoting the opening of his show\n\u201c[Cringe](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1134).\u201d\n\n(You can listen to it on the site there \u2014 just click \u201cFull Episode\u201d on\nthe left side. It\u2019s the first three minutes. It\u2019s much better listened\nto, but if you can\u2019t, here\u2019s a transcript:)\n\n> IRA: Joe worked at this office where, every now and then, the office\n> manager would bring her nine-year-old to work.

But Joel says not only did he\n> cringe when this happened, he cringes every time he tells this story.\n> People cringe when they hear the story. And why? Seriously: why?\n\nYes, why? Not so much why do we cringe, but why do we listen so raptly?\nAs Ira Glass is the first to point out, it\u2019s kind of a boring story on\nits face. It takes him three minutes to tell, but I can tell it in two\nlines: *A guy named Joe once mistook a midget for a nine-year-old. He\ncringes every time he tells the story.* For the purposes of the show,\nthat\u2019s all he needs to say \u2014 the purpose of the story is to set up a\nshow about cringing, and just the idea of mistaking a midget for a\nnine-year-old is pretty cringeworthy. But he tells the story *at\nlength*: except for the very end, he doesn\u2019t appear to try to summarize\nit at all.\n\nAnd yet, not only do people not get bored \u2014 this is apparently what\n*keeps* them from getting bored. (Imagine how quickly people would tune\nout a show of two-sentence stories. Personally, I don\u2019t have to imagine\n\u2014 I see how bored they look when I tell mine. Which, of course, only\nmakes me rush to tell them faster.) Glass argues that humans are somehow\nhardwired for stories. Once they get started, we *have* to hear what\nhappened next. \u201cOne thing happens, and then another thing, and then\nanother thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s got its own momentum \u2014 it\u2019s like a train\nleaving the station.\u201d\n\nI think Ira is being too modest. He\u2019s an incredibly gifted storyteller;\nobviously one of the era\u2019s greatest (his show is the \\#1 podcast on\niTunes). What looks like a simple recording of someone telling a story\nis the result of a thousand different questions and edits and\nadjustments. There\u2019s a lifetime of experience behind every pause, every\nlilt of his cadence. To keep listeners hooked on a story is a very\ndifficult skill.\n\nBut what I didn\u2019t realize was that it\u2019s also a necessary one. Stories\nthat go by too fast may not be as annoying as stories that are too slow,\nbut they\u2019re still flawed. I\u2019m too insecure to think my storytelling\ncould possibly hold the listener\u2019s attention, so I rush through the\nstory, hoping to tell them all the key facts before they get bored and\nwander off. But it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you seem\nuninterested in your story, why should your listener be? If you\u2019re going\nto tell a story, you need to bite the bullet and be a storyteller.\n\nThe trick is realizing that the apparently-irrelevant details aren\u2019t\nactually irrelevant. Look again at my transcript of Joe\u2019s story. There\u2019s\nonly one thing I see in it that could be cut out: that \u201cit\u2019s early in\nthe morning.\u201d Incredibly, every other line in that three-minute story\nserves an important purpose.\n\nPicking a sentence at random, \u201cShe was an incredibly sweet kid.\u201d is\nnecessary because Ira\u2019s comment \u201cThat\u2019s sweet.\u201d sounds odd by itself, it\nneeds a response. (Ira\u2019s comment is necessary to make sure you see the\nchasing-down-the-hallway in the right emotional tone. (That scene, in\nturn, is necessary to explain the kind of relationship he and the girl\nhad, and so on.)) A three minute story, and there\u2019s hardly a clause you\ncan cut.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThat\u2019s the first rule of storytelling: a story needs to be interesting\nin its own right. But the second is equally important: the audience\nneeds a reason to care. I think part of the reason we\u2019re wired to follow\nstories is because a story carries an implied promise: there\u2019s going to\nbe something good at the end of this.\n\nThe way Ira puts it is that there are two tools in storytelling: action,\nand reflection. Ira\u2019s shows (like Gladwell\u2019s articles) open with action.\nBut the action leads immediately to reflection: look at the story above,\nthere\u2019s not even a pause between the ending of the story and Ira asking\nwhy it is that we cringe. Ira\u2019s not just telling the story because it\u2019s\nentertaining, he\u2019s telling it because it makes us cringe and he wants us\nto think about that feeling.\n\nHe goes on to investigate that feeling \u2014 to explain what we can learn\nfrom the story. And here again it\u2019s important to slow down. There\u2019s a\ntendency to think that stories speak for themselves. First, because\nthere\u2019s some artistic nobility in this: explaining what a story means is\nbeing \u201cdidactic\u201d and \u201cpreachy,\u201d it\u2019s keeping your readers from thinking\nfor themselves, it means your work isn\u2019t really art. Second, it often\nseems unnecessary: you\u2019ve spent hours \u2014 days, weeks, months, years \u2014\nthinking about your story. It seems obvious to you what it means. Maybe\nyou can add a sentence spelling it out for the slow ones, but isn\u2019t that\nenough?\n\nIt\u2019s not, of course. Your head is full of evidence, examples, models,\nimplications \u2014 all of which your readers aren\u2019t just going to magically\nintuit. You need to tell them.\n\nAgain, I think I was betrayed by bad writing in my youth. I read a bunch\nof \u201cpopular\u201d books that were just dreadful. I didn\u2019t know that these\nbooks weren\u2019t actually meant for reading. Turns out, you get paid about\nthe same amount for writing a truly great magazine article as you do for\na mediocre one and only get a little more attention for the former. So\nif you write a really good magazine article, the only way to get\nrewarded is to turn it into a book.\n\nThe problem is that even the longest magazine articles don\u2019t make for\nmore 30 pages and you can\u2019t really publish a book that short. So you\nwrite a couple hundred pages of filler. And, in most cases, that only\ndetracts from your great article by watering it down. You basically just\nend up repeating yourself a lot in different words. As a child, I\ncouldn\u2019t stand books like that and vowed never to write one.\n\nBut again I went too far.

In his\nfMRI studies, Dr. Jacobson noted significantly less mental activity in\nthe gangy cortex of Red Sox players when he asked them to visualize\nvarious aspects of a baseball game.\n\n\u201cObviously far more research needs to be done,\u201d explained Dr. Jacobson,\n\u201cbut this evidence does appear to support the popular belief that Red\nSox players are just better than everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe study could have major implications for the entire field of physical\nneuroscience, which examines how differences in the brain can affect\nperformance in various types of strenuous physical activity, including\nbaseball, American football, running the mile, hockey, and the biathlon.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the study but I think it\u2019s extremely brave work,\u201d said\nformer Harvard President Lawrence Summers when asked to comment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an academic orthodoxy of political correctness that says you\nshouldn\u2019t inquire too much into the differences between sports teams.\nWell, Dr. Jacobson has thrown that out the window and science is better\noff for it.\u201d\n\nThe study appears in the July 27th issue of *Nature*, along with new\nresearch showing that [eating chocolate is good for your\nheart](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/glasgow_2001/1521982.stm),\n[Jews are just smarter than everyone\nelse](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2005/12/jews_on_jews_jews_are_great.php),\n[semen makes women\nhappier](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2067223.stm), and [all women\nare\nbisexual](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030613075252.htm).\nA new study showing that having sex with scientists [is associated\nwith](http://cr.yp.to/postpropter.html) a 20-point increase [in\nIQ](http://bactra.org/weblog/523.html) is expected to be released soon.\n", "external_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/glasgow_2001/1521982.stm", "http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2005/12/jews_on_jews_jews_are_great.php", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2067223.stm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030613075252.htm", "http://cr.yp.to/postpropter.html", "http://bactra.org/weblog/523.html"], "time": 1193036400.0, "postid": "areascientist", "internal_links": []}, "sanfrancisco": {"post_title": "San Francisco", "tags": [], "post_content": "San Francisco\n=============\n\nFebruary 3, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/sanfrancisco)\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cSo I find myself back in California,\u201d sings Quasi. And so I do. I spend\nhalf my life trying to get here, I spend the rest trying to get away.\nBut here I finally am, and perhaps it\u2019s time to simply give in.\n\nCalifornia is large; it contains multitudes. Locals claim the peninsula\nis so big and irregular that it even contains microclimates \u2014 areas with\ndifferent weather patterns. There is the glorious hill of Alamo Square,\nnear the apartment I stay in, from which you can see the houses featured\nin the opening credits of *Full House* and watch the city stretch out\nbelow you. As you cross the street to head to the park, if you turn your\nhead in the middle to watch for cars, you see a glorious road roll\ndownwards, ending at a monumental city hall building, a glowing golden\ndome.\n\nOr if you climb Twin Peaks, the hill overlooking Noe Valley, one night,\nthe streetlights make the buildings below look like cardboard backdrops\nand a rolling grid of points of light sweeps out behind it, hills\nculminating in the tall buildings that make up the San Francisco\nskyline.\n\nOr there\u2019s Valencia street, the oddball mix of pirate supply shops,\nburger joints, bike stores, hipster coffee houses and breakfast places,\nalongside restaurants of every ethnicity.\n\nAnd, of course, the city is filled with brilliant and fun people.\nMarxist sex columnists, investigative technology reporters,\nself-experimenting tenured professors, crimefighting lawyers, activist\ntechnologists, startup founders, hackers, hipsters. I could hang out\nwith these people forever.\n\nThen one morning I awoke to find three of my favorite people inviting me\nto find a brilliant new place in the city and be their roommate. It\u2019s a\nhard offer to resist, no matter the city. It\u2019s the day before I leave\nfor my Christmas trip to Europe and I promise myself that before I go\nI\u2019ll see the Sunset. I finish up all my work tasks and run as fast as I\ncan to catch the streetcar that winds its way through the city, past\npastel houses on rolling hills, past video stores and laundromats, past\ncafes and bakeries, past offices and parks.\n\nAnd then we hit the end of the peninsula, a road and then a hill and\nthen a beach. And there it is, [just like in\nLA](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visitingla), the sun setting right\nbefore me, casting a glow over the beach. And the fog is rolling of the\nhills in the nice lines that you thought only existed in heavily\nphotoshopped pictures and you watch the waves on the beach roll up to\nyour feet and the beauty overtakes you and you fall back against the\nhill and there\u2019s really only one thing you can say, even if it\u2019s to no\none but yourself:\n\n\u201cAlright, San Francisco.

Some scholars argued the First\nAmendment\u2019s goal was to create a robust marketplace of ideas: if\neveryone could share their opinion, the truth could come out through\nrobust debate. Others concluded the First Amendment was a sort of\nlogical safeguard: by protecting speech and assembly and petitions for\nredress of grievances, it guaranteed people the right to work against\nlaws they disapprove of, kind of the way the Second Amendment is said to\nbe a bulwark against totalitarianism.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just theoretical debates; the theories have practical\nconsequences for how one interprets that key amendment. If you believe\nit\u2019s for a marketplace of ideas, then you will support regulation aimed\nat correcting market failures by suppressing certain kinds of\nproblematic speech. If you believe it\u2019s a political safeguard, then you\nwill not be too worried about speech regulation aimed at clearly\nnonpolitical speech.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not quite sure why such a theory is needed. The First Amendment\nalways struck me as perfectly clear: \u201cCongress shall make no law.\u201d No\nlaw meant no law (at least with regard to content; I\u2019m more lenient when\nit comes to regulating other aspects). But if one has to have a theory,\nit struck me the right one was something completely different: Because\nWe Can.\n\nThe Framers were very skeptical of government. The system they designed\nwas full of checks and fetters, of which the First Amendment is probably\nthe most extreme (unless you believe in a libertarian conception of the\nTenth). They saw government as a necessary evil; they were willing to\naccept it, but they wanted to constrain it where they could.\n\nAnd speech is a very obvious way to constrain it. A government needs to\nbe able to stop violence and make war and so on or its people will get\nvery badly hurt. But there\u2019s no reason it has to stop speech. As the old\nsaying goes, sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never\nhurt me. Words do hurt, of course, but theirs is a tolerable pain.\nPeople, and society, march on even in the face of grievous insults. And\nso the Framers decided to exclude this class of regulation from the\ngovernment\u2019s ambit. Not because speech is particularly good, but because\nit\u2019s not particularly bad. Because it\u2019s one thing they could safely\nexclude. Because we can.\n\nThe implications of this theory for interpretation are obvious: they\nlead to the most expansive conception of the First Amendment compatible\nwith the other goals of government: a stable democratic body to promote\nthe general welfare, and so on. That\u2019s certainly further than any court\nheretofore has gone and probably a bit further than I\u2019d personally\nprefer, but isn\u2019t that what fetters are for?\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1256022000.0, "postid": "becausewecan2", "internal_links": []}, "proelections": {"post_title": "In Defense of Elections", "tags": [], "post_content": "In Defense of Elections\n=======================\n\nMarch 9, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/proelections)\n\n* * * * *\n\nTraditional left-wing thought treats elections as epiphenomenal: build a\nstrong enough social movement and politicians will be forced to do what\nyou want. In this view, it doesn\u2019t really matter who gets elected since\nthey\u2019re ultimately all subject to the same structural forces. Working to\nget someone \u201cgood\u201d elected is really just a waste of time, since they\u2019ll\nturn out to be as bad as all the others once they get into office.\n\n(Think Noam Chomsky\u2019s comments about the unimportance of electoral\npolitics, or the Alinskyite theory that one should try to cultivate an\nattitude of \u201cfear and loathing\u201d among politicians.)\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a great deal of truth to this \u2014 structural forces are\nultimately very powerful. But I think it misses a great deal as well.\nThis model assumes politicians are this separate class of rational\nactors who respond purely to electoral incentives; if your grassroots\nmovement gets them votes, they\u2019ll help you out, but they\u2019re just as\nhappy to sell you out to a higher bidder.\n\nBut what if the politicians involved are actually activists themselves?\nWhat if the choice isn\u2019t between joining a electoral campaign and\njoining an issue campaign, but between starting a electoral campaign and\nstarting an issue campaign? Here I think the calculus changes wildly.\n\nFor one thing, just at the campaign level, electoral campaigns have a\nlot of advantage over issue campaigns. They fit into a designated \u201cnews\nhole\u201d so it\u2019s easier for the media to cover them, they have clear\ndeadlines which spur people to action, and there\u2019s a clear existing\nmodel for how to do them (including fundraising, scheduling, volunteer\nmanagement, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, if you actually win, you can now continue the campaign from\na much stronger institutional base: you\u2019ll have a full-time salaried\nstaff, your pronouncements will be *de facto* news, and there will be\nstrong social pressure preventing the whole thing from fizzling out as\npeople decide to do other things with their lives.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the positive impact you can make as an\nofficeholder. Obviously you\u2019ll be able to help institutionalize your\ngoals by passing laws and regulations you support (just as you would try\nto push as an outsider), but you\u2019ll also be able to promote things in\ninnumerable smaller ways, just by meeting with other politicians and\nusing the influence of your office. Take this story from Matt Taibbi\nabout Bernie Sanders, the socialist Senator from Vermont:\n\n> [He] kept coming back to a story about his very first meeting with the\n> Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. At the meeting, the\n> subject of the Head Start program had come up. Ted Kennedy, who runs\n> the committee, had proposed a modest increase. Sanders wanted more\u2014so\n> he went and had a word with Kennedy after the meeting.\n>\n> \u201cThe end result is that we got a 6 percent increase, instead of a 4\n> percent increase,\u201d he said. \u201cOver a three-year period, that\u2019s five\n> hundred million dollars more. What I\u2019m finding out is it\u2019s just a\n> different world. Not saying it\u2019s better, it\u2019s just different. If you\n> want something you just go talk to someone in the hall. [\u2026]\u201d\n>\n> He tried to sound like it was a good thing, and it might very well\n> have been, in terms of getting more money for a worthy-enough program.\n> But the subtext of this story was Sanders expressing amazement that he\n> could get \\$500 million just by talking to someone. As any human being\n> would, he looked blown away by the reality of his situation.\n\n(*The Great Derangement*, 127)\n\nObviously there are few offices as powerful as United States Senator,\nbut every job has opportunities for simple victories like these, if at a\nmuch smaller scale. Sure, outside groups can always try to push\nofficials to do things like this, but if you actually are the elected\nofficial you can just do them. (Plus, how often do outside groups know\nabout these simple things?)\n\nThe late Senator Paul Wellstone, who came to electoral politics from\ngrassroots organizing himself, argued that political change had three\nparts: the intellectual work of discovering what\u2019s wrong and how to fix\nit (i.e. policy development), the organizing work of mobilizing citizens\ninto activist groups, and the electoral work of running for office and\ngetting elected. And it seems that the left seems to neglect the last of\nthese.\n\nFor a young leftist, a career in academia or the think tanks is an easy\nchoice, while those who are bolder go into full-time activism. But\nrunning for office never seems like a viable option. (When people ask\nNoam Chomsky how they can fix things, he never says they should run for\noffice.) (We\u2019ll ignore for a moment the delusion the left seems to have\nthat they should run for office as a third-party in a two-party system.)\nThe result is a severe deficit of genuine leftist candidates. Which of\ncourse feeds their sense that politicians are just going to sell you\nout.\n\nLeftists need to think more about running for office. Not as an\nalternative to advocacy or activism, but as an extension of it.\nCampaigns are an incredible opportunity to explain and fight for the\nissues you believe in, while elected offices are a great opportunity to\nachieve them.

What are\nyou working on these days?\u201d \u201cOh, all sorts of things. You know, it\u2019s\npretty crazy as usual. You\u2019re on the Google NDA right?\u201d \u201cYeah, and the\ncorporate email system and contracts and everything.\u201d \u201cOK, so then I can\ntell you a bit. You know how the job is: tracking down people to co-opt\nor destroy.\u201d \u201cMust be exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot usually. Although one exciting thing happened lately. We\u2019re doing a\nmanhunt on this NNA stuff.\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d \u201cApparently some kid found out\nsomething he wasn\u2019t supposed to and we\u2019re tracking him down.\u201d \u201cHuh?\nTracking him down?\u201d \u201cWell, he booked when he found out we were on his\ntail, so we get to use all our databases to try and figure out where he\nfled to and how to get him back. He\u2019s a smart kid \u2014 MIT grad, hacker,\netc. \u2014 so it\u2019s actually a really fun puzzle. The guys back at HQ are\nloving it. It\u2019s like their college puzzle hunts all over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you do when you find him?\u201d Wayne asked. \u201cThe usual,\u201d Samuel\nsaid as if it was obvious. \u201cCo-opt or destroy.\u201d \u201cBut how do you destroy\na kid?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s actually quite fun, although obviously not ideal for\nthe bottom line. Basically we take him out and then falsify a whole\nbunch of evidence to make it look like an accident.

Take him out \u2014 you mean you\u2019ll kill him?\u201d \u201cNot usually; bodies\nare messy to clean up that way.

You of all people should know better than that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not be\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just the price of doing business,\u201d Samuel\ncontinued. \u201cEvery company has its little hidden costs. Factories dump\nharmful chemicals wherever seems convenient. Pharmaceutical companies\ncover up their products\u2019 harms. Conglomerates bribe foreign governments.\nClothing companies engage in human trafficking. Scratch any serious\ncompany and you\u2019ll find some dark little secret. That\u2019s what makes the\nmoney go \u2018round.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but well, taking people out.

And\nwhen [GAP condemns young women to a life of involuntary\nservitude](http://www.coopamerica.org/programs/rs/profile.cfm?id=229),\nthat\u2019s OK. And when [GE dumbs tons of PCBs into the Hudson\nRiver](http://www.cleanupge.org/), that\u2019s just fine. But Google messes\nwith one or two people and it\u2019s suddenly the end of the world? How is\nthat fair?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Wayne, Google\u2019s [one of the ten biggest US\ncompanies](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/11/google-5-us-mar.html).\nIf you think we\u2019re going to keep acting like some little software shop\nin Mountain View, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d \u201cI know, I know, but I thought Google\nwas supposed to be different. What happened to Don\u2019t Be Evil?\u201d Samuel\nlaughed. \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil was some hacker\u2019s PR ploy that got out of hand.\nPaul Buchheit, the guy who made Gmail, suggested it in an early meeting\nand Amit Patel, another early Googler starting writing it on whiteboards\neverywhere. A journalist saw it and the rest was history \u2014 but don\u2019t be\nmistaken, it was never official corporate policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut come on, Samuel, just between us, don\u2019t you ever feel a little bit\nguilty about all this?\u201d \u201cLook Wayne, what good would it do? If I raise\ncomplaints about it to my superior they\u2019ll mark me as unstable and\ndemote me. If I threaten to go public they\u2019ve got an ironclad NDA \u2014\nthey\u2019ll take away my house and family with their crack team of lawyers\nand I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life at a minimum wage job. And if even\nthat doesn\u2019t scare me, then they\u2019ll turn the black ops on me too. When\nthey\u2019re through with me, I\u2019ll be such a gibbering paranoid idiot that\nnobody will take anything I say seriously. So it\u2019s stupid to even think\nabout this stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about your superior? Why not convince him?\u201d \u201cCome on, Wayne,\nyou can\u2019t even convince me this is the wrong thing; you think I\u2019m going\nto be able to convince a guy who does this sort of thing his entire\nlife? And even if I do, then what? He gets fired and ruined right along\nwith me. Why bring another person in on this mess? What good does that\ndo?\u201d\n\nWayne took a long sigh. \u201cBut surely, at some fundamental level, you\u2019ve\ngot to realize this is wrong? Has Google entirely taken away your\nhumanity?\u201d \u201cOh come on, Wayne, that\u2019s not humanity, that\u2019s naievete.\nSure, when they\u2019re a kid everyone thinks they\u2019ll fight for truth and\njustice and the American way of not torturing people. But you also want\nto succeed. And success requires compromise; there\u2019s no other way. If\nyou don\u2019t compromise then they just filter you out. You\u2019re labeled\n\u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018uncooperative\u2019 or \u2018insubordinate\u2019. Believe me; I\u2019ve seen\nit dozens of times. I\u2019ve even done it myself when it had to be done. By\nthe time you get to a position like mine, you begin to realize that this\nis just the way the world works. And what are you supposed to do about\nthat, huh, Wayne?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook Wayne, I\u2019m telling you all this because I know you\u2019re a smart guy.\nYour heart\u2019s in the right place, but so is your head. Google\u2019s counting\non you to be a big success and you can\u2019t do stuff like that if you have\nto worry about every little kid that needs to be quashed. So here, I\u2019ll\npick up the tab. Why don\u2019t you go home and get yourself some rest? And\nthen tomorrow I\u2019ll give you a call and we\u2019ll pick out some fun projects\nfor you to work on? Doesn\u2019t that sound good?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Wayne said at last. \u201cI guess so. God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten\ninto me. I used to be such a hard-head.\u201d \u201cI know, Wayne, I know. That\u2019s\nwhat I like about you. You did whatever it took to get ahead.

Visiting his friends was out\nof the question; Google surely had all of them under surveillance. And\ncalling or emailing them was dangerous too. You never knew when they had\na Google-powered phone or forwarded their email to a Gmail account\n(which lots of people did now just for spam filtering). But what if he\ndidn\u2019t share anything private? He could at least send a message through\nTor telling his friends what had happened.\n\nThe library was closing soon, so he hurriedly composed an email for\nSarah:\n\n> Dear Sarah,\n>\n> I know what I\u2019m going to say will make you think I\u2019ve gone even\n> farther off the deep-end than I already have, but it\u2019s my best shot. I\n> found a backdoor in a popular algorithm and now Google is out to get\n> me. I have to hide out for the moment, but so far I\u2019m OK. Please make\n> sure my friends and folks at the office don\u2019t get too worried about\n> me.\n>\n> I can\u2019t check my email without giving myself away, so if you want to\n> write back, purchase a classified ad in the *New York Times* \u2014 use the\n> word \u201cSarton\u201d.\n>\n> Missing you,\n>\n> Jason\n\nThere, that ought to be at least a start. This way at least Sarah would\nknow what was up and he\u2019d have a safe channel for hearing back from\nSarah. Never any harm in having another channel for information, right?\n\nJason bought himself a pillow and spent the night sleeping with some\nhomeless people in a little cranny near the library that they claimed\neach night. They had turned the unused nook into their own little\ncommunity, gabbing and singing and dancing until late, before curling up\nin a dark place in a sleeping bag that looked like it had been left out\nfor several decades and turning in for the night. One by one, each of\nthem disappeared to curl up and Jason joined them. By the time the sun\nand streetsweepers and cars awoke him the next morning, they were all\ngone, as if their little homeless community had never happened in the\nfirst place.\n\nJason looked out over the world just waking up \u2014 cars driving to work\nbefore the rush hour traffic hit, a couple people scurrying by, shops\ngetting ready to open their doors \u2014 and felt like the world was full of\npossibility. He stretched out and began walking into its gloriously\nbright morning before he realized it wasn\u2019t.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTrent knew that staying on top of the business world meant staying on\ntop of what was happening. So he grabbed an intern and headed to The\nButler and the Chef, a South Park restaurant for one of his espionage\nbreakfasts. Corporate executives from all over town came here to have\nlunch and do deals and Trent made sure he stayed on top of what they\nwere doing by taking regular chances to come here and eavesdrop on their\nconversations.\n\nOf course, he knew that others were eavesdropping on his own, which is\nwhy he brought along the intern: disinformation. \u201cSo, uh, what secret\nprojects are you working on, Trent?\u201d said the intern in a stage voice.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked,\u201d Trent replied. \u201cThings at Newsflip have never been\nmore exciting. In fact, *don\u2019t tell anyone this*, but we\u2019re in the\nmiddle of acquisition talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d the intern said, looking a bit worried. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that \u2014\nwith who?\u201d \u201cWith whom,\u201d Trent corrected. \u201cWith whom?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not at\nliberty to say. But let\u2019s just say it rhymes with boo-gull.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d said\nthe intern, genuinely worried now. \u201cFor how much?\u201d \u201cOh come on,\u201d Trent\nsaid laughing, \u201cyou know I can\u2019t disclose that.\u201d \u201cOh, but just a hint?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you insist\u2026 It\u2019s somewhere between \\$200 million and \\$201\nmillion. A-ha-ha-ha.\u201d The intern, knowing his options wouldn\u2019t vest\nunless he managed to keep his job for another six months, looked down at\nhis soup.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne was having trouble sleeping. He showed up at his office looking\neven more disheveled than usual. Even his assistant, who had taken to\nspending the days chatting with friends on the phone and watching\nYouTube videos, noticed something was up. \u201cSomething wrong, sir?\u201d she\nasked. Wayne mumbled and shuffled into his office.\n\nIt was this damn issue of the kid. Wayne knew, rationally, that it was\nall for the best, but in his heart it just felt wrong to him. He felt\nlike he ought to use his influence to do something. But what could he\ndo? Why, he\u2019d talk about it on his show, of course \u2014 Google money be\ndamned. He set up the video camera and began thinking about what he was\ngoing to say.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve been a supporter of Google in the past,\u201d he\u2019d started. \u201cBut\nI think they\u2019ve finally crossed the line.\u201d\n\nHe looked at himself in the video preview. His shirt was askew and his\nhair in wild clumps standing up from his head. Everything looked badly\nwrinkled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve recently received information that they are chasing and\npersecuting a young kid just beca\u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked into his own eyes on the monitor. And then he shut off the\ncamera. Nobody would believe him. He didn\u2019t have any evidence. And he\ncertainly didn\u2019t look credible. And then what? Google would go after him\n\u2014 not only take away the nice office and the pretty assistant, but drag\nhis name through the mud. And God knows what they\u2019d do to his search\nresults. Wayne shuddered to think of it.\n\nNo, he needed to work this from the inside. Get more information at the\nvery least. He put in a call to Samuel.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSarah read over the email. Then she paused and read it again. And then\nshe freaked out.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cHey, Samuel,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cWayne, good to hear from you, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I was just calling to talk about asking if I could come see some\nGoogle people I wanted to talk to.\u201d \u201cUmm,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cWhat do you\nmean?\u201d \u201cWell, you know that story you were telling me the other night,\nyou know the story about the kid?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking\nabout, Wayne.\u201d \u201cCome on, the other night, at the bar, when you were\ntelling me about the kid you wanted to take o\u2014\u201d \u201cWayne, don\u2019t be silly \u2014\nI was just kidding around about that stuff.\u201d Samuel laughed. \u201cHeh, you\ntook me seriously? Come on. You really think a company like this would\ndo stuff like that. Give me a break! Anyway, if you want the real story\nyou should just come by the offices sometime.\u201d \u201cOh. Uh, okay. How about\ntoday?\u201d \u201cOh, well, umm, I guess that works. What time?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s say\naround 3?\u201d \u201cSure, come on by.\u201d \u201cGreat, see you then.\u201d \u201cGreat, bye.\u201d\n\u201cBye.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nJason was upset. He was letting his emotional mind get the best of him \u2014\nhanging out with homeless people on the street and at the library,\nwriting letters to Sarah. He needed to think rationally. He needed\ncoffee.\n\nHe spent some of his little remaining cash on a large cup of coffee and\nstole a newspaper from behind a register so he could diagram his\nsituation on it.\n\nHere\u2019s how it is: Google was using NNA to control the news. He\u2019d found\nout about this. Google had found out about him. Google didn\u2019t want\npeople to know, so they were trying to stop him. He was trying to stop\nGoogle.\n\nThe solution was obvious: he just needed to use the backdoor to tell\neveryone about what he\u2019d discovered and how Google had been chasing him.\nProving it would be hard but the fact that he could control the news to\nforce his story to the top would probably be proof enough. Google would\ntry to shut things down, of course, but that would only draw more\nattention. There\u2019s nothing Internet geeks hate more than having stuff\nshut down.\n\nSo he just needed to use Tor to launch another exploit on the backdoor.\nIt\u2019d probably require a few tries to get right and he\u2019d have to be very\ncareful about covering his tracks and moving around, but it seemed\ndoable.\n\nHe was just about to fold up the newspaper when he spotted the\nclassifieds. He figured he might as well check for a note from Sarah. He\nscrolled thru them, looking for the word Sarton. Then he found it:\n\n> Dear Sarton, use your powers and say goodbye to the girl. Love, G.\n\n*Shit,* he thought.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBack at the office, Trent ran down his list of priorities. Being the\nboss meant there was just too much to do and far too little time to do\nit, so Trent had developed a system. Actually, he hadn\u2019t really\ndeveloped a system, he\u2019d bought one that had come highly recommended.\nAnd he didn\u2019t practice it so much as give it to his assistant and order\nher to do it.\n\nShe\u2019d come back and insisted that she couldn\u2019t actually do it all by\nherself, that there were things like RAM dumps and reviews that only he\ncould really practice. \u201cOh, alright,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll do the reviews. How\ndo I do that?\u201d And she\u2019d explained that once a week he needed to blah\nblah blah, anyway, he just knew it was important to go over his\npriorities and see how well he was doing at all of them.\n\n\u201cSpreadsheets\u201d \u2014 he\u2019d gotten those all off. \u201cBoost morale\u201d \u2014 his\nmeetings had almost certainly done that. \u201cWelcome new guy\u201d \u2014 oh yeah,\nwhere was the new guy. He recalled him sitting over\u2026 hmm, his seat was\nempty. He headed over, deciding to take a hands-on approach. \u201cHey,\nanyone seen the new guy?\u201d \u201cNah, he\u2019s been working odd hours the past few\ndays.\u201d \u201cHmm, well I guess I did say he could work from home. Hey, what\u2019s\nthat your working on?\u201d \u201cOh, uh, nothing.\u201d \u201cNo, come on, bring that\nwindow back, I want to see it.\u201d \u201cUmm, uh, yeah, here it is.\u201d \u201cWow, this\nlooks great \u2014 I just have a few comments. This whole sidebar needs to be\npurple and instead of a list of news stories this should show the blog\nposts with the number of comments. And each one should have a little\npicture \u2014 pictures are key; they draw attention.\u201d \u201cUm, right \u2014 yeah, I\nguess so.\u201d \u201cGlad we\u2019re on the same page \u2014 I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nTrent headed back to his desk and called over his assistant. \u201cSandy,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cTell Jane to meet me in my meditation chamber.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she\nsaid, and Trent watched as she rushed back towards her desk. He grabbed\nthe bag under his desk and headed to the meditation chamber. God, he\nloved running a company.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne got in his car and headed down the long Bay Area highways toward\nMountain View. He passed offices and billboards, trees and curving\nstreets, HOV lanes and overpasses. But eventually he ended up in what\ncould have been its own small city, a maze of office buildings and\nlittle poorly-signed streets. At the center of it all was the famed\nBuilding 42 complex, with its volleyball courts and dinosaur skeletons\nand huge cafeterias, and sexy colorful architecture. But radiating out\nfrom that were increasingly drab gray buildings separated by large\nstreets and parking lots where they kept all the real employees, the\npeople who stayed up into 3 in the morning to make sure that the Java\ncode that drew the sidebars of help pages worked properly.\n\nAs Google had built more and more projects, they needed an increasing\nnumber of these grunt-work programmers. They had started interviewing\njust about everyone CS graduate, in the hopes of filtering out the good\nones and luring them here to their artificial wonderland in Mountain\nView.\n\nWayne headed for the lobby.\n\n*Next year:* [Chapter 12](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity12)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1197619200.0, "postid": "bubblecity11", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity12"]}, "bubblecity12": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 12", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 12\n=======================\n\nDecember 29, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity12)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[part of *Bubble City*](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity)\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d asked the woman at the reception desk. The lobby was filled\nwith colorful baubles \u2014 lava lamps and bouncy balls, comfy sofas and\ncomputer terminals, and a minifridge stocked with a wide variety of\nOdwalla beverages. The whole thing was calibrated perfectly to seem\nsomehow relaxed yet ostentatious at the same time.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d the receptionist asked again, a little less patient this time.\nShe was an attractive woman, Wayne thought \u2014 mid-twenties, straight\nbrown hair, thick-rimmed glasses perched atop a prominent nose \u2014 he\nstruggled to focus. \u201cUh, yes, hello there,\u201d he finally said.\n\n\u201cWhat brings you to Google today?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOh, uh, I\u2019m here to see\u2014I mean, I guess\u2014I have a meeting.\u201d\n\nShe stared a bit, then nodded. \u201cI see. Can I ask with whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cSamuel Boxton. He\u2019s expecting me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. And your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cWayne Darnus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Wayne. It\u2019ll just be a moment while I ring him. In the mean\ntime, can you sign in on this computer?\u201d She pointed to a terminal on\ntop of the desk before tapping a few keys, apparently connecting the\nhands-free headset she was already wearing.\n\nThe terminal asked for his name, employer, host, and signature (for the\nmandatory non-disclosure agreement, of course), before printing out a\nbadge he was encouraged to affix to his chest, marking him as an\ninterloper.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Darnus here to see you,\u201d the receptionist was saying. \u201c42\nLobby. Of course.\u201d She turned to Wayne. \u201cHe\u2019ll just be a minute \u2014 please\ntake a seat.\u201d\n\nOn the coffee table were the various usual industry magazines, which\nWayne thumbed through nervously before putting them back down. He\nscanned the walls, which were covered in various plaques and puff pieces\nand commendations. He begun to feel very small and felt his heart beat a\nlittle more quickly. Why did a place designed to seem so friendly\nactually seem to make him feel scared?\n\nWayne\u2019s eyes made several more circuits around the room and through the\nmagazines before Samuel suddenly arrived, bright and cheerful as\nanything. \u201cWayne! Good to see you!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nWayne jumped up, extending an arm. But Samuel went in for a full embrace\n\u2014 not something Wayne was used to; usually the situation was reversed.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Samuel said, \u201cright this way.\u201d Samuel led him out of the lobby\nand into the courtyard. They went past the endless swimming pool and the\nvolleyball court, the dinosaur skeleton and model rocketship \u2014 all\nglinting in the sun. As they went further, the buildings became more\nbland and boxy, across parking lots and service ways and sidestreets,\nparts of the sprawling Google campus normal visitors rarely saw.\n\nThey entered another building through a backdoor, Samuel swiping his\nkeycard to get in. After that came a maze of twisty little passageways,\nwith little in the way of signage to help distinguish between them. They\ncame to a series of metal doors labeled \u201cAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\u201d\nwhich this time required a palm-print. Finally, they reached a\nconference room labeled 10\\^2 - e\\^i\u03c0.\n\n\u201cTake a seat,\u201d Samuel offered.\n\nWayne did, grabbing a seat and the end of a long conference table.\nSamuel grabbed one around the corner from him, a large projector filling\nthe wall at his back.\n\n\u201cSo, Wayne, I understand you have some concerns,\u201d he offered. \u201cCan we\ntalk about them?\u201d\n\n\u201cConcerns?\u201d Wayne said nervously. \u201cOh, no \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Nothing\u2019s been bothering you? Here\u2019s your chance to have it out\nwith the big guys \u2014 we here at Google are all ears!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, really, I think Google\u2019s been doing a great job.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Wayne,\u201d Samuel said, sliding a mouse and keyboard in front of\nhim. \u201cWith a couple of taps here, I can get you any Google employee you\nwant. Is there really nothing at all you have to say to them?\u201d Samuel\nwas looking Wayne straight in the eye.\n\n\u201cUh, hmm, well, it\u2019s a very generous offer you have there, but, uh \u2014 I\nreally just can\u2019t think of anything right now. Uh, heh, if only you\u2019d\ngiven me time to prepare! A-heh-heh. I\u2019m sure I could have thought of\nplenty of things!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to hear you say that, Wayne. Because a funny thing\nhappened this morning. I was just doing some regular user analysis on\nour Google Videocast software \u2014 nothing out of the ordinary, of course \u2014\nand I just happened to come across this little clip.\u201d\n\nSamuel tapped a few keys and there, in full-screen video, was Wayne, his\nhead filling the whole back wall, then repeated in miniature on various\nscreens across the room. Wayne recognized the video and his stomach\nbegan to sink:\n\n> I know I\u2019ve been a supporter of Google in the past. But I think\n> they\u2019ve finally crossed the line.\n>\n> I\u2019ve recently received information that they are chasing and\n> persecuting a young kid just beca\u2014\n\nWayne slunk into his seat.\n\n\u201cNow, I hope you understand my predicament, Wayne,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cAs\npart of Google Evangelism, it\u2019s my job to ensure that the world thinks\nonly the best of Google. That they see all the good things we\u2019re doing\nfor the world. That they see all the progress we\u2019re inspiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of Google products, billions of dollars have been added to the\nglobal economy, people are sharing and communicating more than ever\nbefore, kids in Africa now get a chance to read every book in the\nlibraries of Harvard.\u201d Samuel looked wistful. \u201cIt\u2019s really some amazing\nstuff. And I\u2019m proud just to be a part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why I can\u2019t let you jeopardize all that,\u201d he said, turning\nserious. \u201cEspecially not by repeating some crazy story I told you over\ndrinks. No, there\u2019s just too much at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m a good person. Here at Google we\u2019re all good people. *Don\u2019t\nbe evil* is our motto, for goodness\u2019 sake. But doing what\u2019s good isn\u2019t\nthe same as doing what\u2019s easy. Sometimes making the right decisions\nrequires doing things that are really very hard. An this is one of those\nsituations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all love you here at Google, Wayne. And we\u2019ve always been eager to\nsupport you \u2014 surely you know that more than anyone. But I think we\u2019ve\nreached a point in our relationship where it might be best to keep you a\nlittle closer.\u201d Samuel smiled.\n\n\u201cCloser?\u201d Wayne said, finally. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nSamuel reached underneath the desk for something. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait\nright here a minute and we\u2019ll show you. Just a sec!\u201d Then he got up and\nwalked down the hall and thru the large metal doors, leaving Wayne and\nhis visitors\u2019 badge behind him.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTrent felt the wind riffling through his hair, the top down on his BMW\n328i. He was heading north, past the San Francisco traffic, across he\nbeauty of the Golden Gate Bridge, through the gorgeous hills and valleys\nof Marin, to the spacious beauty of Napa.\n\nThe life of a technology executive was stressful, which is why these\nwork-related getaways were so important. It seemed like every month\nthere was some kind of executive retreat up here \u2014 a place where the\nImportant Men of Business could get away from it all, loosen their ties,\nand swap stories in the golden California sun.\n\nThey were roughin\u2019 it.\n\nHe parked his car on the gravel, before heading to the courtyard where a\nsuited caterer was pouring drinks. \u201cWhiskey sour,\u201d he ordered, before\nlooking for somewhere to mingle.\n\n\u201cHey, Trent! It\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d A man he didn\u2019t quite recognize\ngrabbed him by the shoulder. \u201cThank you *so* much for coming \u2014 it\u2019s a\nreal treat to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, of course!\u201d Trent replied. \u201cHow could I resist another\nchance to visit a beautiful place like this?\u201d He gestured around him.\n\n\u201cWell, just make yourself at home. We\u2019ve got some time to chat until six\nand then we\u2019ll all be heading into town for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nThe fellow, who was apparently the host, smiled and headed off in search\nof other people to welcome.\n\n\u201cDon, from Google,\u201d someone said, extending a hand.\n\n\u201cTrent, from Newsflip,\u201d Trent replied.\n\n\u201cAhh, Newsflip \u2014 I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about you,\u201d Don said.\n\n\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m very glad to hear that. We always look up to our friends\ndown in the Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Don said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be down there for long. I just\ngot word that I\u2019m going to be one of the lucky few who can transition to\nour upcoming San Francisco office.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Well, congratulations!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. You know, actually, we have an interesting meeting coming up\non NNA-related issues at Google Mountain View. You really should\nattend.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fascinating. I\u2019ll definitely send a programmer or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this is a very high-level summit. Just CEOs and above. Obviously\nthe top people from our side will be there as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Trent said.

After all, the airport was designed with the same basic\nconcepts, the people all looked fairly normal, and all the\nadvertisements were all identical to their counterparts in the US.\n\nOnce we left the airport and begun wandering around Berlin, things\ndidn\u2019t get much better. There was a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and a Burger King, a\nPizza Hut and a T-Mobile store (called T-Punkt in some weird homage to\nAshton Kutcher), ads for Coca-Cola and even a The Body Shop. (A major\nshopping mall was run by Sony; just like in old SF.) The streets looked\nroughly similar, the cars had the same manufacturers, the buildings had\nthe same basic styles.\n\nThe similarity plays tricks on you. It not only took me a while to\nrealize I was in Germany, it was a while before I realized this was the\nformer home of the Nazis. (I was trying to think where I\u2019d heard of the\nReichstag before\u2026) When I exclaimed my discovery, apparently the older\npeople on the bus turned to look at me. One wonders how much of their\nfitting in is an attempt to forget their different past.\n\nThere were still differences, of course. In America, if someone knocked\nyou out and took you on a plane to some random city in the country, you\nprobably wouldn\u2019t notice except for the fact that the street signs might\nhave changed color. Aside from that tiny bit of individuality, cities in\nAmerica are almost literally indistinguishable, down to the streets and\nlandscaping. Germany isn\u2019t that bad.\n\nThe most obvious is that they get to keep speaking their quirky little\nlanguage, although only speaking English here gets you pretty far. On\nthe other hand, their currency\u2014and presumably their government\u2014has been\nintegrated into the EU. But the biggest thing you notice is that the\ncity is simply more elegant. The cars are smaller, the public transit\nfar superior, and the font on the street signs to die for. But if london\nhad EU currency, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019d be all that distinguishable.\n\nThere is a blatant taste for modernist architecture. (This is the land\nof the Bauhaus, I suppose.) Just about every building I\u2019ve been to has\nbeen done up in styles that would be considered high culture in America.\nIncluding our hotel room, where you can see into the top half of the\nshower from the bed and a door swings between the shower and the toilet,\nso that you can only use one with any privacy at once.\n\nDespite the usual guidebook platitudes, Berlin does not feel like a\nparticularly vibrant city. Abandoned construction sites are everywhere,\nwith large quantities of supplies just laying by the street, and\ngraffiti coats most public surfaces, not enough to demand a repainting,\nbut enough to make it everpresent. All the stores have signs announcing\nthat new, shorter hours will begin starting next year. I overhear\ncomplaints about 18% unemployment.\n\nWith an overseas like this, one wonders why Americans make such a fuss\nabout going overseas. One can apparently visit Europe with about as much\nculture shock as visiting LA: a few different local chains, a different\npublic transit system, a new accent to learn, and, of course, a new set\nof street signs. A convenience for the business traveler, perhaps.

Miner\u2019s arrival forces Jim into a series of awkward\ncomic mishaps, thus suggesting Jim\u2019s normal level of cool isn\u2019t just\nbecause he\u2019s a naturally cool person but only because he\u2019s particularly\nwell-suited to his normal situation. But Miner ultimately reveals\nhimself to be overly aggressive, thereby, Kotsko argues, showing Jim\u2019s\nawkwardness was merely a result of Miner being a fundamentally awkward\nperson and thus withdrawing the tentative suggestion that awkwardness\nmight actually be situational.\n\nI think this is a misreading that shows the limits of a theory of\nawkwardness that lacks a notion of competence. For this arc shows\nprecisely the opposite of what Kotsko says it does: it shows that\nawkwardness *is* fundamentally situational.\n\nMiner\u2019s addition to the series marks the rare appearance of a character\nthat is more competent than Jim. However much Jim may feel himself above\nthe petty stressors of the Scranton office, Miner is far above that,\nexecuting with a similar level of suave at a much higher rung in the\norganization. When Jim comes face-to-face with a superior talent, it\nimmediately reduces him to the level of gibbering awkwardness his\ncoworkers are always finding themselves in, thereby demonstrating Jim\u2019s\nlevel of comfort isn\u2019t an innate character trait, but simply the result\nof being well-adapted to his absurd environment.\n\nThe reveal of Miner\u2019s aggression is not an undercutting but an emphasis\nof this theme. How did Miner get to be so cool? Was he just born with\neven more innate coolness than Jim and thus is able to be awkward in\nfewer situations? On the contrary, this coda reveals. Miner got to where\nhe is through an aggressive ambition. His relentless striving has forced\nhim to be competent in more and more business situations so he can move\nup the corporate ladder.\n\n*The Office* operates under a sort of Peter Principle of awkwardness.\n[The Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle)\nsays employees are promoted to the level of their incompetence (since as\nlong as they remain competent, they keep getting promoted). *The Office*\ndemonstrates that being incompetent is awkward, so people are thereby\npromoted to the level of their awkwardness. Thus Michael Scott (Steve\nCarrell), who is actually a quite talented and thoroughly comfortable\nsalesman, gets promoted to regional manager, where he is an awkward and\nincompetent dolt. We can only assume that Miner is normally at the level\nof his awkwardness as well; he only seems cool when slumming it in\nScranton, the same way that Jim only gets to seem cool by being\nunambitious enough to persist in a job he is obviously too good for. It\nis our ambition that makes us awkward, the show argues.\n\nThis is emphasized in the later plot where David Wallace (Andy Buckley),\nwho appears as a confident corporate CFO in earlier seasons, gets made\nredundant in Dunder Mifflin\u2019s acquisition by Sabre and is forced to\nretire to his suburban mansion with his generous severance package.\nWithout a corporate ladder to climb but with his ambition intact, he now\nfinds himself working on a startup (producing a vacuum for children\u2019s\ntoys called \u201cSuck It\u201d). But his competence as an upper executive is\nworthless as a startup founder and makes him so painfully awkward that\neven Michael can\u2019t stomach it. (Later, when Wallace returns to the\ncorporate world, he\u2019s immediately unawkward again.)\n\nThe clear message is the opposite of Kotsko\u2019s reading: we are all\nawkward when we\u2019re out of our depth; our only escape from awkwardness is\nto develop a competence for a particular situation. But even that is\nshort-lived: our ambition will drive us to leave such non-awkward\ncomforts for the next challenge \u2014 and even if we don\u2019t, the vagaries of\neconomic forces may still push us into a role we are ill-suited for. The\nonly refuge from this pervasive awkwardness is the pervasive boredom of\nunambition.\n\nP.S.

Sometimes the articles are clear: the\nresearch has only found a correlation between two variables \u2014\nbreastfeeding and low blood pressure were found together. But more\noften, they imply that causation is at work \u2014 that breastfeeding\n*causes* lower blood pressure.\n\nYou\u2019ve surely heard that old statistics adage: correlation does not\nimply causation. Just because breastfeeding and low blood pressure are\nfound together doesn\u2019t mean the first caused the second. Perhaps the\nsecond caused the first (moms might prefer to keep breastfeeding calmer\nbabies) or some other thing caused both of them (maybe moms who don\u2019t\nwork both tend to breastfeed and stress their kids less). You can\u2019t tell\nfrom correlation alone.\n\nIndeed, the philosopher David Hume argued that we could *never* know\nwhether causation was at work. \u201cSolidity, extension, motion; these\nqualities are all complete in themselves, and never point out any other\nevent which may result from them,\u201d he wrote. But not causation: \u201cOne\nevent follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them.\nThey seem conjoined, but never connected.\u201d\n\nAnd, as philosophers since Plato and Sextus Empiricus have argued, such\nevidence can deceive us. Imagine finding a button and, each time you\npress it, a beep is heard. Normally, we\u2019d assume that the button always\ncauses the beep. But we\u2019d be wrong \u2014 one day the power goes out and the\nbutton does nothing.\n\nWhich is why, centuries later, Karl Pearson, the founder of mathematical\nstatistics, banned the notion of causality from the discipline, calling\nit \u201ca fetish amidst the inscrutable arcana of modern science\u201d and\ninsisting that just by understanding simple correlation one \u201cgrasped the\nessence of the conception of association between cause and effect.\u201d\n\nHis followers have kept it banished ever since. \u201cConsiderations of\ncausality should be treated as they have always been in statistics:\npreferably not at all,\u201d wrote a former president of the Biometric\nSociety. \u201cIt would be very healthy if more researchers abandon thinking\nof and using terms such as cause and effect,\u201d insisted another prominent\nsocial scientist.\n\nAnd there the matter has stayed. Causality is a concept as meaningless\nas \u201cthe soul\u201d and just as inappropriate for modern mathematical science.\nAnd yet, somehow, this doesn\u2019t seem quite right. If causation is nothing\nbut a meaningless word that laypeople have layered over correlation,\nthen why the ceaseless insistence that \u201ccorrelation does not imply\ncausation\u201d? Why are our thoughts filled with causal comments (he made me\ndo it!) and never correlational ones?\n\nThe result is exceptionally strange. Statistics has no mathematical way\nto express the notion \u201cmud does not cause rain\u201d. It can say mud is\ncorrelated with rain (i.e. that there\u2019s a high probability of seeing mud\nif you see rain), no problem, but expressing the simple causal concept \u2014\nthe kind of thing any five-year-old would know \u2014 is impossible.\n\nStatisticians may have never had to confront this problem but, luckily\nfor us, Artificial Intelligence researchers have. It turns out if you\u2019re\nmaking a robot, having a notion of causality is essential \u2014 not just\nbecause it\u2019s the only way to understand the humans, but because it\u2019s the\nonly way to get anything done! How are you supposed to turn the lights\non if you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the light-switch and not the clicking\nnoise that causes it?\n\nThe result is that in recent years several teams of AI researchers have\nturned their focus from building robots to building mathematical tools\nfor dealing with causality. At the forefront is Judea Pearl (author of\nthe book *Causality*, Cambridge University Press) and his group at UCLA\nand Clark Glymour (author of *The Mind\u2019s Arrows*, MIT Press), Peter\nSpirtes, and their colleagues at Carnegie Mellon. The result is a quiet\nrevolution in the field of statistics \u2014 one most practicing\nstatisticians are still unaware of.\n\nThey started by dismissing Plato\u2019s skepticism about the problem.\nGranted, they say, we may never know for sure whether the button\n*always* causes the beep, but that\u2019s too stringent a demand. Science\nnever knows anything for sure \u2014 the best we can hope for is extracting\nthe most knowledge from the evidence we have. Or, as William James put\nit, \u201cTo know is one thing, and to know for certain that we know is\nanother.\u201d\n\nNext, they created a new mathematical function to formalize our notion\nof causality: *do(\u2026)*. *do* expresses the notion of intervening and\nactually trying something. Thus, to mathematically express the notion\nthat mud does not cause rain, we can say P(rain | do(mud=true)) =\nP(rain) \u2014 in other words, the chance of rain given that you made it\nmuddy is the same as the chance of rain in general.\n\nBut causes rarely comes in pairs like these \u2014 more often it comes in\ncomplicated chains: clouds cause rain which causes both mud and wet\nclothing and the latter causes people to find a change of clothes. And\nso the researchers express these as networks, usually called causal\nBayes nets or graphical causal models, which show each thing (clouds,\nrain, mud) as a node and the causal relationships as arrows between\nthem:\n\n       (clouds)\n          |\n          |\n          v\n        (rain)\n         /\\\n        /  \\\n       /    \\\n      v      v\n    (mud)  (wet)\n             |\n             |\n             v\n          (change)\n\nAnd all this was just the warm-up act. Their real breakthrough was this:\njust as kids can discover causes by observation, computers can discern\ncauses from data. Now obviously the easiest way to do this is just to\nmeasure what happens when you do(X=x) directly \u2014 this, for example, is\nwhat randomized controlled trials do. Kids do it by dropping a fork on\nthe floor and seeing if this causes Mom to pick it up; scientists do it\nby randomly giving some people a real drug and others just a placebo.\nThe result is that we can be sure of the cause \u2014 after all, it was *we*\nwho dropped the fork and gave out the drug; nothing else could be\nsneaking in and causing it.\n\nBut in most cases we don\u2019t have this luxury. We\u2019d like to know whether a\nnew tax policy will cause the economy to tank *before* we enact it; we\u2019d\nlike to know whether smoking causes cancer without forcing kids to\nsmoke; and even in randomized controlled trials, we can give half the\npatients the real drug, but we can\u2019t make them take it. If the drug\nbeing tested makes someone so horribly sick that they stop taking it and\nthen get better, drug trials still count that as a victory for the drug!\n\nObviously we can\u2019t always know such things just from observing, but in a\nsurprising number of cases we can. And the researchers have developed a\nmathematical method \u2014 called the *do*-calculus \u2014 for determining just\nwhen you can. Feed it a Bayes network of variables, their relationships,\nand their values, and it will return back what it knows and with what\ncertainty.\n\nThus, in an example Pearl frequently uses, tobacco companies used to\nargue that the correlation between smoking and cancer was simply because\nthere were certain genes that made people both more likely to smoke\n*and* more likely to get cancer. It didn\u2019t matter if they quit smoking \u2014\ntheir genes would lead cancer to get them anyway. Pearl shows that if we\nassume only smoking causes tar deposits on the lungs and the tar\ndeposits are the only way smoking causes cancer, we can simply measure\nthe tar deposits and calculate whether the tobacco companies are right.\n\nOr, in another example in his book *Causality*, he analyzes data from a\nstudy on a cholesterol-reducing drug. Since whether people got the\nplacebo or not is unassociated with any other variables (because it was\nrandomly assigned) if we merely assume that receiving the real drug has\n*some* influence on whether people take it, we can calculate the\neffectiveness of the drug even with imperfect compliance. Indeed, we can\neven estimate how effective the drug would have been for people who were\nassigned it but didn\u2019t take it!\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all \u2014 Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour have developed an\nalgorithm (known as PC, for Peter-Clark) that, given just the data, will\ndo its best to calculate the causal network behind it. You can download\nthe software implementing it, called [TETRAD\nIV](http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/tetrad4.html), for free from\ntheir department\u2019s website \u2014 it even has a nice graphical interface for\ndrawing and displaying the networks.\n\nAs an experiment, I fed it some data from the IRS about 2005 income tax\nreturns. It informed me that the percentage people donate to charity is\ncorrelated with the number of dependents they have, which in turn\ncorrelates with how much people receive from EITC. That amount, along\nwith average income, causes how many people are on EITC. Average income\nis correlated with the tax burden which is correlated with inequality.\nAll interesting and reasonable \u2014 and the result of just a few minutes\u2019\nwork.\n\nThe applications for such tools are endless. As Pearl points out, they\nhave the possibility to radically improved how statistics are used in\nmedicine, epidemiology, economics, sociology, and law. And, as Glymour\nobserves, it lets us better understand results in neuroscience and\npsychology. Take *The Bell Curve*, the 1992 bestseller that argued\nblacks had lower IQs, causing poorer performance in school and thus\nlower-paying jobs and more crime. Glymour shows, by applying the\n*do*-calculus, these results only hold if you assume that there are no\nother interactions between the variables (e.g. that parental attitude\ntoward learning doesn\u2019t affect both IQ and performance in school). But\nthe PC algorithm and TETRAD IV can demonstrate otherwise.\n\nSuch results may be a revolution in social science, but compared to\nbuilding human-like robots, they\u2019re child\u2019s play. That\u2019s certainly the\nimpression one gets from Pearl. Discussing his work at a conference of\nArtificial Intelligence researchers, he said:\n\n> One of the reasons I find these areas to be fertile grounds to try out\n> new ideas is that, unlike AI, tangible rewards can be reaped from\n> solving relative small problems.

Others, meanwhile,\ninsisted my claims were so obviously wrong as to not be even worth\ndiscussing.\n\nJimbo Wales, on the other hand, finally sent me a nice message the other\nday letting me know that he\u2019d removed the offending section from his\ntalk and looked forward to sitting down with me and investigating the\ntopic more carefully.\n\nAnd for my part, I hope to be able to take up some of the offers I\u2019ve\nreceived for computer time and run my algorithm across all of Wikipedia\nand publish the results in more detailed form. (I\u2019d also like to use the\nresults to put up a little website where you can type in the name of a\npage and see who wrote what, color-coded or something like that.)\n\nAs for the election itself, it\u2019s much harder to draw firm conclusions.\nIt\u2019s difficult in any election, this one even more so because we have so\nlittle data \u2014 no exit polls or phone surveys or even TV pundits to rely\nupon. Still, I\u2019m fairly content seeing the kind words of all the\nincredible people I respect. Their support means a great deal to me.\n\nThe same is true of the old friends who wrote in during my essays along\nwith all the new people who encouraged me to keep on writing. Writing\nthe essays on a regular schedule was hard work \u2014 at one point, after\nsleeping overnight at my mother\u2019s bedside in the hospital, I trundled\ndown at seven in the morning to find an Internet connection so I could\nwrite and post one \u2014 but your support made it worth the effort.\n\nI hope that whoever wins takes what I\u2019ve written into consideration. I\u2019m\nnot sure who that is yet, but there are some hints. I was reading an\nirreverent site critical of Wikipedia when I came across its claim that\nJimbo Wales had sent an email to the Wikipedia community telling them\nwho they should vote for. I assumed the site had simply made it up to\nattack Jimbo, but when I searched I found [it really was\ngenuine](http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/009964.html):\n\n> I personally strongly strongly support the candidacies of Oscar and\n> Mindspillage.\n>\n> [\u2026]\n>\n> There are other candidates, some good, but at least some of them are\n> entirely unacceptable because they have proven themselves repeatedly\n> unable to work well with the community.\n\nFor those reading the tea leaves, this suggests that the results will be\nsomething like: Eloquence, Oscar, Mindspillage. But we\u2019ll see.\n\nThe let-down after the election is probably not the best time to make\nplans but, if I had to, I\u2019d probably decide to stay out of Wikipedia\nbusiness for a while. It\u2019s a great and important project, but not the\none for me.\n\nAnyway, now everyone can [go back to vandalizing my Wikipedia\npage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).

Second, that\nstartups may represent [a new economic\nphase](http://www.paulgraham.com/highres.html), replacing the [corporate\nladder of old](http://www.paulgraham.com/ladder.html). Now he\u2019s\nsuggesting that these two effects combined might lead to [a very local\neconomic revolution](http://www.paulgraham.com/revolution.html).\n\nThe first point \u2014 that tech startups collect in Silicon Valley \u2014 is\ncertainly true, just like car companies all tend to cluster in Detroit.\nThis is because of a feedback effect set off by some random initial\ncondition: Shockley Semiconductor was started in Silicon Valley, so when\nits employees left to start their own companies they did so there, and\nso on. Now everyone in the industry moves to Silicon Valley because\nthat\u2019s where everyone else is.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new idea; it was a central topic in Paul Krugman\u2019s\nresearch, for example, and even before that you can see similar ideas\nexpressed by social theorists like Jane Jacobs. (For more information,\nsee the Wikipedia article [Business\ncluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster), Krugman\u2019s\n*Geography and Trade*, and Jacobs\u2019 brilliant book *The Economy of\nCities*.) Industries tend to cluster together.\n\nThe second \u2014 that startups represent a new economic phase \u2014 may also be\ntrue. It\u2019s a rather more extreme claim, but it would be pretty cool.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it combines with the first to create a local\nrevolution. It\u2019s true, tech startups have generated a lot of wealth, but\nthey\u2019re far from the only kind of startup to do so. The amazing thing\nabout the Internet is that it makes all sorts of startups possible.\n\nPreviously, if you wanted to start a newspaper, you had to buy a\nbuilding and hire a staff and get some printing presses and a delivery\nservice and an ad sales team and access to the wire services. Now you\njust start a blog, read the wire services online, and link to the\nstories you like.\n\nPreviously, if you wanted to sell a new kind of soap, you had to build\nwarehouses and a distribution network and a shipping infrastructure and\nmake deals with retail outlets. Now you have [Amazon Fulfillment\nServices](http://www.amazonservices.com/content/fulfillment-by-amazon.htm)\nhandle all the physical details and just advertise your product on the\nWeb.\n\nAnd new startups are helping this process along all the time. One Y\nCombinator startup tries to make things easier for food producers,\nanother helps you run an online magazine. More are surely close behind.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that a soap company which only sold through the\nInternet would always be a small concern. But why should it be any\ndifferent from Internet companies? Reddit was small when it started, but\nit quickly grew through word-of-mouth. Sure, we had some tough nights\nmaking things scale, but in the end we were able to ramp up to a site\nwith millions of users.\n\nSimilarly, I met [some folks in Brooklyn who started a small salsa\ncompany](http://bksalsa.com/) in their apartment. At first they made the\nsalsa in their kitchen and sold jars through their bedroom window. As\nbusiness picked up, they got a bigger space and started selling more.\nNow they\u2019re manufacturing in scale and you can find them at Whole Foods.\nThis worked because New York City was a big enough audience that they\nhad room to scale up. The Internet is big in exactly the same way.\n\nAs the Internet is everywhere and everyone knows how to use it, why\nwon\u2019t we see online startups in every industry? And then why not all\nacross the globe? It may make sense for tech startups to move to Silicon\nValley, but does it really make sense for soap startups? For food\nstartups? No, it seems more likely that each industry will cluster the\nway tech companies and car companies have.\n\nSilicon Valley may have had the first wave, but the next one belongs to\nthe world.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html", "http://www.paulgraham.com/highres.html", "http://www.paulgraham.com/ladder.html", "http://www.paulgraham.com/revolution.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster", "http://www.amazonservices.com/content/fulfillment-by-amazon.htm", "http://bksalsa.com/"], "time": 1239778800.0, "postid": "nonlocal", "internal_links": []}, "rawnerve": {"post_title": "Raw Nerve", "tags": [], "post_content": "Raw Nerve\n=========\n\nAugust 18, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis is a series of pieces on getting better at life.\n\n1.

You ask one of your pre-programmed root servers who is in charge of\n    `.com`\n2.  They respond with VeriSign, so you ask VeriSign who is in charge of\n    `pentagonpapers.com`\n3.  They respond with Acme ISP, so you ask ACME ISP where to find\n    `pentagonpapers.com`\n4.  It responds with an IP address, so you request the page from that IP\n\nThe censors can ask VeriSign to give them control of pentagonpapers.com,\nthey can try to shut down Acme ISP, they can try to prevent you from\ngetting hosting, and they can try to shut down your IP. All of these\nhave been used recently, with some success. You need a backup plan.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine we want this URL to resolve in an uncensorable way. How\nwould we do it?\n\nStep one: Domain name ownership\n-------------------------------\n\nFirst we would have a *certificate authority* (CA) which would sign\nstatements of the form: \u201cAs of [DATE], [DOMAIN NAME] is owned by the\nholder of [PUBLIC KEY].\u201d (Let\u2019s call this a *certificate*.)\nConveniently, there\u2019s already a whole industry of trusted businesses\nthat make these statements \u2014 they\u2019re called SSL certificates.\n\nThe problem is that CAs are presumably just as subject to attack as the\nregistrars (in fact, in some cases they are the registrars!). One\npossibility is to set up a certificate authority that will not sign such\nstatements for people attempting to engage in censorship. It seems\nprobable that such a policy would be protected by the First Amendment in\nthe US. However, \u201cpeople engaging in censorship\u201d is a somewhat\nsubjective notion. Also, it\u2019s always possible a court could order the\ncertificate authority to turn over the private signing key (or the key\ncould be obtained in some other way).\n\nAnother possibility is some kind of \u201crollback UI\u201d. If you know vaguely\nwhen the censorship attempts started, you can only trust certifications\nmade before that date. This is a somewhat difficult feature to implement\nin a way that makes sense to users, though. The best case scenario is\none in which the user can clearly distinguish between a censored and\nuncensored page. In that case, if the page appears censored they can hit\na \u201cgo back a month\u201d button and the system will only trust certifications\nmade more than a month prior to the certification it\u2019s currently using.\nThe user can hit this button repeatedly until they get an uncensored\nversion of the page.\n\nStep two: Web page authentication\n---------------------------------\n\nNext the owner of the website will need to sign statements of the form\n\u201cThe content of [URL] had the hash [HASH] on [DATE].\u201d (Let\u2019s call this\nan *authenticator*.) Now given a page, a corresponding valid\nauthenticator, and a corresponding valid certificate (call this trio an\n*authentic page*), browsers can safely display a page even if it can\u2019t\naccess the actual web server. The digital signatures work together to\nprove that the page is what the website owner wanted to publish. If a\nbrowser gets back multiple authentic pages, it can display the latest\none (modulo the effects of the \u201cgo back a month\u201d button).\n\nStep three: Getting authentic pages\n-----------------------------------\n\nSet up a series of domain-to-certificate servers. These servers take a\ndomain names (e.g. `pentagonpapers.com`) and returns back any\ncertificates for it. Certificates can be obtained by [crawling the\nWeb](https://www.eff.org/observatory) or by being submitted by website\nowners or by being submitted by the CAs themselves.\n\nSet up a series of URL-to-hash servers. These servers take a URL and\nreturn back any valid authenticators for that URL. Authenticators are\nvery small, so each URL-to-hash server can probably store all of them.\nIf spam becomes a problem, a little bit of hashcash could be required\nfor storage. Website owners submit their authenticators to the\nURL-to-hash servers.\n\nSet up a series of hash-to-URL servers. These servers take a hash and\nreturn a series of URLs which can be dereferenced in the normal way to\nobtain a file with that hash. People can submit hash-to-URL mappings to\nthese servers and they can attempt to automatically verify them by\ndownloading the file and seeing if the hash\nmatches.^[1](#fn:fn1)^^[2](#fn:fn2)^ Again, these mappings are very\nsmall so each server can probably store all of them.^[3](#fn:fnr)^\n\nThen there are a series of servers that host controversial files.\nPerhaps they saved a copy before the site was censored, perhaps they\nreceived it thru some out-of-band channel^[4](#fn:oob)^. However they\ngot it, they put them up on their website and then submit the URL to the\nhash-to-URL servers. Meanwhile, the site publisher submits an\nauthenticator to the URL-to-hash servers.\n\nNow, if a browser cannot obtain the `pentagonpapers` page through normal\nmeans it can:\n\n1.  Ask each domain-to-cetificate server it knows for certificates for\n    `pentagonpapers.com`\n2.  Ask each URL-to-hash server it knows for authenticators for the URL\n3.  Ask each hash-to-URL server it knows for alternative URLs\n4.  Download from the alternative URLs^[5](#fn:fnb)^\n\nThis can be implemented through a browser plugin that you click when a\npage appears to be unavailable. If it takes off, maybe it can be built\nin to browsers. (While I\u2019ve been assuming the worst-case-scenario of\ncensorship here, the system would be equally useful for sites that are\njust down because their servers couldn\u2019t handle the load or some other\ninnocent failure.)\n\nThis system should work unless our adversary can censor every well-known\nCA, every well-known URL-to-hash server, every well-known hash-to-URL\nserver, or every alternative URL.\n\nStep four: Beyond the Web\n-------------------------\n\nWe can help ensure this by operating at least one of each as a Tor\nhidden service. Because the operator of the service is anonymous, they\nare immune to legal threats.^[6](#fn:fn3)^ If the user doesn\u2019t have Tor,\nthey can access them through [tor2web.org](http://tor2web.org/).\n\nSimilarly, if you know your document is going to get censored, you can\nskip steps 1 and 2. Instead of distributing a `pentagonpapers.com` URL\nwhich is going to go down, you can just distribute the hash. For users\nwhose browsers don\u2019t support this system, you can embed the hash in a\nURL like:\n\n    https://hash2url.org/sha1/284219ea93827cdd26f5a697112a029b515dc9a4\n\nwhere `hash2url.org` is a hash-to-URL server that redirects you to a\nvalid URL.\n\nAnd, of course, if you somehow have access to a working P2P system, you\ncan just it to obtain authentic pages.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about this system is that it gets you censorship resistance\nwithout introducing anything wildly new. There are already certificate\nauthorities. There are already hash-to-URL servers. There are already\nmirrors. There\u2019s already Tor. (There\u2019s already tor2web.) The only really\nnew thing specific to censorship resistance is URL-to-hash servers of\nthe form I described, but they\u2019re very simple and hopefully\nuncontroversial.\n\nThere is some work to be done stitching all of these together and\nimproving the UI, but unlike with some other censorship-resistance\nsystems, there\u2019s nothing you can point to as having no good purpose\nexcept for helping bad guys. It\u2019s all pretty basic and generally useful\nstuff, just put together in a new way.\n\n**If you\u2019re interested in helping build something like this,** please\nsend me an email: [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com).\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Any server will have finite bandwidth, so an attacker could try to\n    fool the hash-to-URL server by submitting a URL which when\n    dereferenced never stops sending the data. The hash-to-URL servers\n    should stop after a certain limit and mark the URL as unverified due\n    to max file size. If the server ever obtains a file whose size is\n    under the limit with that hash, it can toss all such\n    URLs.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn1)\n\n2.  URLs can go out of date so perhaps upon receiving sufficient\n    complaints about a URL being \u201cbad\u201d, the server should attempt to\n    reverify. Again, hashcash can be used throughout to avoid\n    spam.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn2)\n\n3.  A possible protocol for the above two servers is provided in [RFC\n    2169](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2169.txt).\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fnr)\n\n4.  I have ideas on how to automate this, naturally, but this essay is\n    already far too long.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:oob)\n\n5.  *Optional bonus:* Use HTTP Range headers to download 1/n of the file\n    from each of the n URLs. There are some circumstances where this\n    could speed things up. Or maybe it\u2019s just annoying.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fnb)\n\n6.  This moves the censorship weak link to the distribution of\n    introduction points to hidden services.^[7](#fn:fn5)^ But instead of\n    being published by a DHT, introduction points can be distributed\n    through a flood protocol^[8](#fn:fn6)^. Or maybe the DHT can be\n    modified so that there\u2019s no obvious censorship\n    point?\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn3)\n\n7.  The introduction points themselves can\u2019t be censored because they\n    don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking to. (I think they do in the current\n    implementation of Tor, but this doesn\u2019t seem necessary. The hidden\n    service can generate a new keypair for each introduction point and\n    send the public key to the introduction point and to\n    Alice.)\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn5)\n\n8.

One group is asked whether they would administer\na treatment that would definitely save 200 people\u2019s lives or one with a\n33% chance of saving 600 people. The other group is asked whether they\nwould administer a treatment under which 400 people would definitely die\nor one where there\u2019s a 33% chance that no one will die.\n\nThe two questions are the same: saving 600 people means no one will die,\nsaving just 200 means the other 400 will die. But people\u2019s responses\nwere radically different. The vast majority of people chose to save 200\npeople for sure. But an equally large majority chose to take the chance\nthat no one will die. In other words, just changing how you describe the\noption \u2014 saying that it saves lives rather than saying it leaves people\nto die \u2014 changes which option most people will pick.\n\nIn the same way that Festinger, et. al. showed that our intuitions are\nbiased [by our social\nsituation](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ethicsfor), Kahneman and\nTversky demonstrated that humans suffer from consistent cognitive biases\nas well. In a whole host of examples, they showed people behaving in a\nway we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to think was irrational \u2014 like changing their\nposition on whether to administer a treatment based on what it was\ncalled. (I think a similar problem affects our intuitions about killing\nversus letting die.)\n\nThis is a major problem for people like Frances Kamm, who think our\nmoral philosophy must rely on our intuitions. If people consistently and\nrepeatedly treat things differently based on what they\u2019re called, are we\nforced to give that moral weight? Is it OK to administer a treatment\nwhen it\u2019s described as saving people, but not when it\u2019s described as not\nsaving enough? Surely moral rules should meet some minimal standard of\nrationality.\n\nThis problem affects a question close to Kamm\u2019s work: what she calls the\nProblem of Distance in Morality (PDM). Kamm says that her intuition\nconsistently finds that moral obligations attach to things that are\nclose to us, but not to thinks that are far away. According to her, if\nwe see a child drowning in a pond and there\u2019s a machine nearby which,\nfor a dollar, will scoop him out, we\u2019re morally obligated to give the\nmachine a dollar. But if the machine is here but the scoop and child are\non the other side of the globe, we don\u2019t have to put a dollar in the\nmachine.\n\nBut, just as with how things are called, our intuitions about distance\nsuffer from cognitive biases. Numerous studies have shown that the way\nwe think about things nearby is radically different from the way we\nthink about things far away. In [one\nstudy](http://www.scribd.com/doc/24928678/Lessons-from-a-Faraway-land-The-effect-of-spatial-distance-on-creative-cognition),\nIndiana University students did better on a creativity test when they\nwere told the test was devised by IU students studying in Greece than\nwhen they were told it was devised by IU students studying in Indiana.\n\nIt\u2019s a silly example, but it makes the point.

(To accomplish this feat, the trail makes some\nbizarre choices, like going right through the middle of the cities\nbusiest streets and public squares.) To all appearances, the area is\ncompletely unremarkable \u2014 some grass, a grate, a few pillars, an odd\nsculpture. But if you look up, a bizarre exhibit is laid out in the sky.\n\nThe pillars, you see, stop above eye level and then continue upwards\nwith poles. Atop the poles are sculptures, model replicas of important\nSomerville buildings and things. And at the entrance, soaring overhead,\nwhere no one ever looks, is an enormous sign: Seven Hills Park,\nSomerville. And next to it is a large cow sitting on a compass.\n\nThe whole park is filled with this kind of gag. On each pillar is a sign\ndescribing the replica that sits atop it. One gushes about a particular\nbuilding\u2019s importance to the Revolutionary War, then describes what\nhappens to it. First it was sold to a mental asylum (albeit one [for the\nstars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean_Hospital)), then the asylum\nmoved and abandoned it. Then the building was razed. And then the entire\nhill it sat on was razed and turned into a landfill. Every pillar has a\nstory like this: important landmark, cut down by human folly.\n\nThen there are the sculptures. The sculptures are life-size replicas of\npeople in everyday poses \u2014 sitting on the bench, standing with their\ncoat folded over their arm, and so on \u2014 placed right in the middle of\nthings as if they were real. So the first surprise is that the people\nwho seem real are really sculptures and that the sculptures aren\u2019t set\noff with signs or space but thrown in with everything else.\n\nSo then you admire the happy poses of the sculptures before you notice\nanother oddity: everyone in the sculptures is wearing a mask over their\nface. Still, the faces all seem like happy ones, until you look at them\nmore carefully. A father appears to gaze down lovingly at the infant son\nin his arms, until you look more closely, and you see that he\u2019s not\nlooking at his son at all. He\u2019s staring at the ground at the gaze of\nlove is really more one of wistfulness \u2014 he\u2019s imagining he was somewhere\nelse right now; somewhere nice.\n\nIn another, two parents look down at their son in what first appears to\nbe admiration but on further inspection is more like shock. And shock\nseems appropriate, because the kid who appears to be their son is\ndressed up in a bizarre costume of suspenders and is stretching his arms\nlike he\u2019s about to go build a railroad. I still don\u2019t know what in the\nworld is going on with that one. It freaks me out every time I walk by.\n\nIt\u2019s weird having sculptures you can just hang out with like this. You\ncan sit on the bench next to a woman hugging her small child. And you\ncan look right into her face, get right into her space, get closer than\nyou ever could if she were real, analyze her gaze in far more detail\nthan would be polite in public.\n\nAnd perhaps this is the real message of the statues, and the park:\nThings are always much more complicated than they first seem, and you\ncan see it if you look closely, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re all to busy to\nnotice.

I used to take them at their word. I always\nthought Stanford was a very pretty campus. Now I realize that it was\nmerely bright.\n\nComing back to Stanford after living in San Francisco is an odd\nexperience, because the place seems so obviously much more fake. You\ndon\u2019t notice when you\u2019re in it, but Stanford is a real wonder of a\nbubble. Surrounded by a moat of trees, it pretends to be its own\nself-sufficient city, complete with its own name (Stanford, California\nis not technically a city, but only a \u201ccensus-designated place\u201d; it has\nits own zip code, nonetheless). It has its own food, housing, public\ntransit system, gas station (this is California), police force, job\nopenings, newspaper, and events calendar. Most large universities have\nsuch things, of course, but they mesh with and supplement the outside\nworld. At Stanford, despite being in the center of Silicon Valley, you\u2019d\nhardly know the outside world existed.\n\nEverything here is immaculately clean. There is rarely weather, just\nconstant sun from a cloudless sky (the sky kindly rains only at night so\nas not to disturb anyone). There are no outsiders, just scrupulously\nexamined teachers, carefully selected students, and well-behaved\nmaintenance staff (who are not paid a living wage, despitee the\nproteests of generous-minded students).\n\nComing back to Stanford, wandering its august halls once again, it feels\nso strange. I lived here for a full year; this should feel like coming\nhome. But while I recognize it all \u2014 not much changed while I was gone \u2014\nit doesn\u2019t feel like home at all. Everything seems, well, smaller.\n\nPart of that, obviously, is literally true: I\u2019m physically bigger now,\nso things seem smaller in comparison. But it also feels psychologically\nsmaller, like after living in San Francisco I can no longer accept this\nsimulated city as a reality. Instead, I\u2019m constantly seeing it in its\ncontext in the wider world.\n\nThe result is that everything feels like a bizarre show, played out on\nthis phony stage. Beautiful guys in pajamas, talking to beautiful girls\nin less. Party music blaring. Kids scooting elegantly by on bicycles.\nBefore I just thought this was the strange reality of the world I was\ndropped into. Now I see it as just another act.\n\nI went to the top of the large tower in the middle of the Stanford\ncampus, something I\u2019d never found the time to do while I was a student.\nAnd looking out, the school splayed before me, I noticed something odd.\nThe beaultiful Stanford buildings, so varied and complex at ground\nlevel, all look like big red rectangles from the sky. Perhaps Stanford\nis one of those things you really have to be in to genuinely see.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1165046400.0, "postid": "stanfordagain", "internal_links": []}, "dalio": {"post_title": "Lean into the pain", "tags": [], "post_content": "Lean into the pain\n==================\n\nSeptember 1, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*This post is part four of the series [Raw\nNerve](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).*\n\nWhen you first begin to exercise, it\u2019s somewhat painful. Not wildly\npainful, like touching a hot stove, but enough that if your only goal\nwas to avoid pain, you certainly would stop doing it. But if you keep\nexercising\u2026 well, it just keeps getting more painful. When you\u2019re done,\nif you\u2019ve really pushed yourself, you often feel exhausted and sore. And\nthe next morning it\u2019s even worse.\n\nIf that was all that happened, you\u2019d probably never do it. It\u2019s not that\nmuch fun being sore. Yet we do it anyway \u2014 because we know that, in the\nlong run, the pain will make us stronger. Next time we\u2019ll be able to run\nharder and lift more before the pain starts.\n\nAnd knowing this makes all the difference. Indeed, we come to see the\npain as a sort of pleasure \u2014 it feels good to really push yourself, to\nfight through the pain and make yourself stronger. Feel the burn! It\u2019s\nfun to wake up sore the next morning, because you know that\u2019s just a\nsign that you\u2019re getting stronger.\n\nFew people realize it, but psychological pain works the same way. Most\npeople treat psychological pain like the hot stove \u2014 if starting to\nthink about something scares them or stresses them out, they quickly\nstop thinking about it and change the subject.\n\nThe problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the\ntopics that are most important for us: they\u2019re the projects we most want\nto do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the\nbiggest consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we\nrun. We\u2019re scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if\nwe never think about them, then we can never do anything about them.\n\nRay Dalio writes:\n\n> It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one\u2019s\n> limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength\u2014whether it\u2019s in\n> the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other\n> way. Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are\n> approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the\n> same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to\n> push our limits. Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the\n> body and the mind to encountering one\u2019s limits, which is painful. In\n> other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering\n> one\u2019s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important\n> juncture in our decision-making process.^[1](#fn:d)^\n\nYes it\u2019s painful, but the trick is to make that mental shift. To realize\nthat the pain isn\u2019t something awful to be postponed and avoided, but a\nsignal that you\u2019re getting stronger \u2014 something to savor and enjoy. It\u2019s\nwhat makes you better.\n\nPretty soon, when you start noticing something that causes you psychic\npain, you\u2019ll get excited about it, not afraid. *Ooh, another chance to\nget stronger.* You\u2019ll seek out things you\u2019re scared of and intentionally\nconfront them, because it\u2019s an easy way to get the great rewards of\nself-improvement. Dalio suggests thinking of each one as a puzzle,\ninside of which is embedded a beautiful gem. If you fight through the\npain to solve the puzzle, you unlock it and get to keep the gem.\n\nThe trick is: when you start feeling that psychological pain coming on,\ndon\u2019t draw back from it and cower \u2014 lean into it. Lean into the pain.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn agile software development, there\u2019s a phrase: If it hurts, do it more\noften.^[2](#fn:f)^\n\nFor example, imagine Jane and Joan are working on a software project\ntogether. They both have a copy of the code; Jane is making the error\nmessages friendlier while Joan is adding a new feature. They both work\non their task for days and days until it\u2019s finally done. Now they face a\nproblem: they need to *merge* their different changes back together.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve had this problem, either with code or with text documents:\nyou send a draft of a report to two friends, both suggest different\nchanges, and you have to merge all their changes back into the original\ndocument. It\u2019s incredibly annoying \u2014 and doing it with software is way\nworse. So people put it off. Jane thinks \u201cyou know, let me just make the\nthank you messages a little nicer before we merge\u201d and Joan thinks \u201cyou\nknow, let me add just one more feature before we merge\u201d.\n\nThey keep putting the merge off, and every time they do the task gets\nbigger and more painful. But they have to do it eventually. By then, the\nmerge is so big that it takes days of painstaking work just to piece\ntogether the already-written code. It\u2019s an arduous, painful process \u2014\nwhich makes Joan and Jane just want to put it off even longer next time.\n\nThe agile approach, however, is to do the opposite: merging hurts, so\nwe\u2019ll do it more often. Instead of merging every couple weeks, or every\ncouple months, we\u2019ll merge every single day, or every couple hours. Even\nif Jane and Joan aren\u2019t even close to finished with their work, they\u2019ll\ncheck in what they have so far (maybe with some special code\ndeactivating it until it\u2019s finished) so they don\u2019t end up in merge hell\nlater on. These very small merges tend not to be painful at all, they\u2019re\nso easy that you hardly even notice.\n\nThe same principle shows up all across software development: from\ntesting to releasing, your natural inclination is to put off painful\nthings, when doing them more often actually is much easier.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s limited to software. I think the same principle\nwould work even if, for some odd reason, you were required to touch a\nhot stove for an hour. Procrastinating and putting it off until you had\nno choice but to hold your hand to the stove for a full hour would end\nup being very painful. But if you did it in small frequent bits, just\nquick taps of the stove with your finger that eventually added up to an\nhour, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad at all. Again, the trick is not to run from\nthe pain.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOf all the self-improvement tricks I\u2019ve learned, this one was by far the\nmost surprising \u2014 and by far the most impactful. I spent most of my life\nhemmed in by my talents. I knew I had strengths and weaknesses and it\njust seemed obvious I should find jobs that fit my strengths. It seemed\ncrazy to take a job that probed my weaknesses.\n\nSure, there were somethings, over there, that I wished I was better at,\nbut they seemed so far away. Meanwhile, there were lots of things over\nhere that I was good at. Why not just keep doing them? Sure, I realized\nintellectually that [I could get\nbetter](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) at the other stuff, but it\nhardly seemed worth the pain of trying.\n\nI\u2019d learned [not to shrink from hard\ntruths](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis), so I\u2019d literally have\nthis conversation with myself: \u201cYes, I know: if I got better at selling\nthings to people [or whatever it was], I\u2019d be much better off. But look\nat how painful I find selling: just thinking about it makes me want to\nrun and hide! Sure, it\u2019d be great if I could do it, but is it really\nworth all that pain?\u201d\n\nNow I realize this is a bogus argument: it\u2019s not that the pain is so bad\nthat it makes me flee, it\u2019s that the importance of the topic triggers a\nfight-or-flight reaction deep in my reptile brain. If instead of\nthinking of it as a scary subject to avoid, I think of it as an exciting\nopportunity to get better, then it\u2019s no longer a cost-benefit tradeoff\nat all: both sides are a benefit \u2014 I get the benefits of being good at\nselling and the fun of getting better at something.\n\nDo this enough times and your whole outlook on life begins to change.\nIt\u2019s no longer a scary world, hemming you in, but an exciting one full\nof exciting adventures to pursue.^[3](#fn:s)^\n\nTackling something big like this is terrifying; it\u2019s far too much to\nstart with. It\u2019s always better to start small. What\u2019s something you\u2019ve\nbeen avoiding thinking about? It can be anything \u2014 a relationship\ndifficulty, a problem at work, something on your todo list you\u2019ve been\navoiding. Call it to mind \u2014 despite the pain it brings \u2014 and just sort\nof let it sit there. Acknowledge that thinking about it is painful and\nfeel good about yourself for being able to do it anyway. Feel it\nbecoming less painful as you force yourself to keep thinking about it.\nSee, you\u2019re getting stronger!\n\nOK, take a break. But when you\u2019re ready, come back to it, and start\nthinking of concrete things you can do about it. See how it\u2019s not as\nscary as you thought? See how good it feels to actually do something\nabout it?\n\nNext time you start feeling that feeling, that sense of pain from deep\nin your head that tells you to avoid a subject \u2014 ignore it. Lean into\nthe pain instead. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\n**Next in this series:** [Confront\nreality](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/anders)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Even in high school\nwhen the principal was \u201ccool\u201d \u2014 I\u2019d tell him school was harmful and\nshould be abolished, he\u2019d agree, and we\u2019d talk about it \u2014 it still felt\nwrong. And it always felt worse when, as surprisingly often was the\ncase, the powerful man in the big chair talked about how powerful you,\nthe puny little pushed-around student, were.\n\nI remember the time in 7th grade that the teacher told me to leave the\nroom and fill out one of his \u201cdispute resolution forms\u201d \u2014 his method of\nclassroom discipline. I resisted by filling out the form in an absurd\nmanner, because the whole thing was just so degrading. Then the teacher\ncomplained that *I* was being condescending! (A few years later, after\nthe 7th grade teacher had moved out to a cabin in the Pacific Northwest\nwith my 6th grade teacher, he came back to school and seemed much\ncooler, so I don\u2019t think it was really his fault.)\n\n*You sure weren\u2019t rich, didn\u2019t live in the city\\\n Didn\u2019t whisper sweet nothings, never told me I\u2019m pretty*\n\nAll this by way of saying I received a rather discomfitting feeling when\n[unnamed authority figure] sent me a cryptic note saying she wanted me\nto come see her. I asked her about what but she never replied. (She\nlater explained that she meant to but it just got behind.)\n\nWorried, I asked a few people about what [unnamed authority figure] did.\n\u201cHave you committed any crimes recently?\u201d asked one. \u201cNot that I know\nof,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I kill people in my sleep?\u201d But how do I dispose of\nthe bodies? The lake\u2019s already run dry! Another, always optimistic,\ninsisted it must be a good thing. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have her deliver bad\nnews. It can only be good.\u201d I wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nAs I walked to the meeting, there was a different disposition. I heard a\ngirl screaming her lungs out and then slapping her boyfriend, who had\napparently cheated on her. The boyfriend was desperately penitent,\ninsisting it was just an accident, not a pattern, and that he loved her.\n\n*You cheated at cards, and lied when you hung out\\\n in bars making time with those girls you called old pals*\n\nNone of this eased my discomfort, nor did the fact that I had a major\nassignment due in a couple hours. 90% of my grade in one class depended\non what work I turned in today by 5pm and I hadn\u2019t really started on it.\nI tried to do it last night but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it until I\nwas too tired to make any progress. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d have any better\nluck this morning.\n\nWhen I finally saw [unnamed authority figure] she was so happy that I\ncouldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling. Maybe she was right \u2014 maybe it was\ngood news. Then we sat down. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about some of your\nbehavior,\u201d she began. Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good.\n\n*I cried when you left me,\\\n now I\u2019m wondering when you\u2019ll make it all up to me?*\n\nShe said she\u2019d been tipped off by my IHUM TF, which was odd, since we\u2019d\njust had a long talk a week ago or so and I thought we\u2019d worked\neverything out. Not that there really was a whole lot to work out.\nActually, that talk probably just made it worse.\n\nBut then she\u2019d done her own research and begun telling me what she\u2019d\nuncovered:\n\n-   She\u2019d pulled my admissions applications and saw that I was really\n    self-schooled, meaning I was probably \u201ca bit more isolated or\n    sheltered from your peers than might be typical.\u201d\n\n-   She checked with the Residence Dean at my dorm and found [I was too\n    shy to ask someone for help moving a filing\n    cabinet](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001421).\n\n-   She also heard (amazingly) that I\u2019d [written some hurtful\n    things](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001641) about a \u201cyoung woman I\n    was dating\u201d.\n\n-   The TF had said that I once blurted something out in class, which I\n    don\u2019t really remember specifically but certainly seems plausible.\n\n-   The TF also claimed that once I had jumped out at her and said boo.\n\n-   The TF also said that I\u2019d once said she went to a lower-class school\n    and suggested I was trying to call her authority into question.\n\n\u201cIt paints an interesting picture for me,\u201d she said. I laughed to\nmyself. \u201cHeh, it\u2019s just like one of those television season finales, you\nknow, where the main characters get called before an authority figure\nwho then proceeds to list everything they\u2019ve done over the season, only\nit\u2019s all a little off and a little out-of-context.\u201d Like that *Seinfeld*\nfinale, where everyone they\u2019d ever met started to testify against them.\n(See how I self-consciously point out the clich\u00e9s I\u2019m in? Let it never\nbe said that this blog is not post-modern!)\n\nIt certainly was an interesting picture. I was beginning to sound sort\nof autistic or something. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve made a couple mistakes,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cbut doesn\u2019t everyone? The difference is that mine are just a\nlittle more public and mine are the ones being scrutinized.\u201d If reality\nTV has taught us anything, it\u2019s that you can find something in anything,\nif you look hard enough.\n\n*[Don\u2019t I have the\nright](http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_I_Have_The_Right) to\nbe over you yet?\\\n I\u2019ve tried pretending. I tried to forget.*\n\nWe kept talking \u2014 for a half-hour altogether \u2014 but every time I tried to\ntell her about myself it just kept sounding worse. The facts were all\nable to fit the frame.\n\n\u201cWell, what suggestions do you have?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cOne strange\nthing about me is that I love hearing negative things about myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d she replied. \u201cYeah, I guess most people, when they receive\nnasty letters, they feel bad or something. But I love them \u2014 the nastier\nthe better. the ones that are all obscentities just make my day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said and thought about it. \u201cThere\u2019s\nthis theory,\u201d I said, \u201cthat\u2019s very popular in our society that people\nhave certain specific attributes, like personality traits. So some\npeople are smart and other people are funny and that\u2019s just how it is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. I think people are malleable. I think I\u2019m\nmalleable. So whe I hear something negative, I don\u2019t think \u2018oh no, I\u2019m a\nbad person\u2019, I think \u2018well, that\u2019s something I can work on.\u2019\u201d She didn\u2019t\nseem convinced.\n\nWell, she didn\u2019t want to punish me or anything, she said, and she didn\u2019t\nknow me well enough to give any specific advice, but she suggested I\ntalk to my friends (I tried to persuade her that I had some) and ask\nthem about my \u201coutbursts\u201d and \u201cempathy\u201d.\n\n*Though it\u2019s past three AM, I would still let you in\\\n \u2018cause I can\u2019t go on dreaming alone.*\n\n* * * * *\n\nI couldn\u2019t find anything to take to lunch to read, which is generally a\nsign I\u2019ll find someone to talk to. And sure enough I found one of those\nfriends and sat down. \u201cDo you think I have problems with empathy?\u201d I\nasked him. \u201cUhhh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d I told him the story.\n\u201cHeh, that\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got called to the principal\u2019s\noffice for hurting someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, when my friend has left and I\u2019m all alone, a hand grabs my\nshoulder. I spin around but I don\u2019t recognize its owner. \u201cHey, Schwartz,\nI\u2019m really sorry you didn\u2019t win evil dictator last night,\u201d he says.\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI voted for you,\u201d he says. \u201cOh. Thank you,\u201d I say\nand walk away. After a few seconds I realize what he\u2019s referring to \u2014\nthe dorm passed out surveys for things like \u201cfunniest guy\u201d and so on and\nannounced the results in a *Family Feud*-style gameshow last night.\nMaybe I have more friends than I think.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_I_Have_The_Right"], "time": 1117868400.0, "postid": "season1finale", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001421", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001641"]}, "usefultransparency": {"post_title": "When Is Transparency Useful?", "tags": [], "post_content": "When Is Transparency Useful?\n============================\n\nFebruary 11, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/usefultransparency)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*The following essay appears in the new O\u2019Reilly book* [Open\nGovernment](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0596804350) *and attempts to\ncombine and clarify some of the points I made in previous essays. It was\nwritten in June 2009.*\n\n*Transparency* is a slippery word; the kind of word that, like *reform*,\nsounds good and so ends up getting attached to any random political\nthing that someone wants to promote. But just as it\u2019s silly to talk\nabout whether \u201creform\u201d is useful (it depends on the reform), talking\nabout transparency in general won\u2019t get us very far. Everything from\nholding public hearings to requiring police to videotape interrogations\ncan be called \u201ctransparency\u201d\u2014there\u2019s not much that\u2019s useful to say about\nsuch a large category.\n\nIn general, you should be skeptical whenever someone tries to sell you\non something like \u201creform\u201d or \u201ctransparency.\u201d In general, you should be\nskeptical. But in particular, reactionary political movements have long\nhad a history of cloaking themselves in nice words. Take the Good\nGovernment (goo-goo) movement early in the twentieth century. Funded by\nprominent major foundations, it claimed that it was going to clean up\nthe corruption and political machines that were hindering city\ndemocracy. Instead, the reforms ended up choking democracy itself, a\nresponse to the left-wing candidates who were starting to get elected.\n\nThe goo-goo reformers moved elections to off-years. They claimed this\nwas to keep city politics distinct from national politics, but the real\neffect was just to reduce turnout. They stopped paying politicians a\nsalary. This was supposed to reduce corruption, but it just made sure\nthat only the wealthy could run for office. They made the elections\nnonpartisan. Supposedly this was because city elections were about local\nissues, not national politics, but the effect was to increase the power\nof name recognition and make it harder for voters to tell which\ncandidate was on their side. And they replaced mayors with unelected\ncity managers, so winning elections was no longer enough to effect\nchange.^[1](#fn:*)^\n\nOf course, the modern transparency movement is very different from the\nGood Government movement of old. But the story illustrates that we\nshould be wary of kind nonprofits promising to help. I want to focus on\none particular strain of transparency thinking and show how it can go\nawry. It starts with something that\u2019s hard to disagree with.\n\nSharing Documents with the Public\n---------------------------------\n\nModern society is made of bureaucracies and modern bureaucracies run on\npaper: memos, reports, forms, filings. Sharing these internal documents\nwith the public seems obviously good, and indeed, much good has come out\nof publishing these documents, whether it\u2019s the [National Security\nArchive](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/), whose Freedom of Information\nAct (FOIA) requests have revealed decades of government wrongdoing\naround the globe, or the indefatigable [Carl Malamud and his\nscanning](http://public.resource.org/), which has put terabytes of\nuseful government documents, from laws to movies, online for everyone to\naccess freely.\n\nI suspect few people would put \u201cpublishing government documents on the\nWeb\u201d high on their list of political priorities, but it\u2019s a fairly cheap\nproject (just throw piles of stuff into scanners) and doesn\u2019t seem to\nhave much downside. The biggest concern\u2014privacy\u2014seems mostly taken care\nof. In the United States, FOIA and the Privacy Act (PA) provide fairly\nclear guidelines for how to ensure disclosure while protecting people\u2019s\nprivacy.\n\nPerhaps even more useful than putting government documents online would\nbe providing access to corporate and nonprofit records. A lot of\npolitical action takes place outside the formal government, and thus\noutside the scope of the existing FOIA laws. But such things seem\ntotally off the radar of most transparency activists; instead, giant\ncorporations that receive billions of dollars from the government are\nkept impenetrably secret.\n\nGenerating Databases for the Public\n-----------------------------------\n\nMany policy questions are a battle of competing interests\u2014drivers don\u2019t\nwant cars that roll over and kill them when they make a turn, but car\ncompanies want to keep selling such cars. If you\u2019re a member of\nCongress, choosing between them is difficult. On the one hand are your\nconstituents, who vote for you. But on the other hand are big\ncorporations, which fund your reelection campaigns. You really can\u2019t\nafford to offend either one too badly.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a tendency for Congress to try a compromise. That\u2019s what\nhappened with, for example, the Transportation Recall Enhancement,\nAccountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act. Instead of requiring\nsafer cars, Congress simply required car companies to report how likely\ntheir cars were to roll over. Transparency wins again!\n\nOr, for a more famous example: after Watergate, people were upset about\npoliticians receiving millions of dollars from large corporations. But,\non the other hand, corporations seem to like paying off politicians. So\ninstead of banning the practice, Congress simply required that\npoliticians keep track of everyone who gives them money and file a\nreport on it for public inspection.\n\nI find such practices ridiculous. When you create a regulatory agency,\nyou put together a group of people whose job is to solve some problem.\nThey\u2019re given the power to investigate who\u2019s breaking the law and the\nauthority to punish them. Transparency, on the other hand, simply shifts\nthe work from the government to the average citizen, who has neither the\ntime nor the ability to investigate these questions in any detail, let\nalone do anything about it. It\u2019s a farce: a way for Congress to look\nlike it has done something on some pressing issue without actually\nendangering its corporate sponsors.\n\nInterpreting Databases for the Public\n-------------------------------------\n\nHere\u2019s where the technologists step in. \u201cSomething is too hard for\npeople?\u201d they hear. \u201cWe know how to fix that.\u201d So they download a copy\nof the database and pretty it up for public consumption\u2014generating\nsummary statistics, putting nice pictures around it, and giving it a\nsnazzy search feature and some visualizations. Now inquiring citizen can\nfind out who\u2019s funding their politicians and how dangerous their cars\nare just by going online.\n\nThe wonks love this. Still stinging from recent bouts of deregulation\nand antigovernment zealotry, many are now skeptical about government.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust the regulators,\u201d they say. \u201cWe need to be able to\ninvestigate the data for ourselves.\u201d Technology seems to provide the\nperfect solution. Just put it all online\u2014people can go through the data\nwhile trusting no one.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: if you can\u2019t trust the regulators, what makes\nyou think you can trust the data?\n\nThe problem with generating databases isn\u2019t that they\u2019re too hard to\nread; it\u2019s the lack of investigation and enforcement power, and websites\ndo nothing to help with that. Since no one\u2019s in charge of verifying\nthem, most of the things reported in transparency databases are simply\nlies. Sometimes they\u2019re blatant lies, like how some factories keep two\nsets of books on workplace injuries: one accurate one, reporting every\ninjury, and one to show the government, reporting just 10% of\nthem.^[2](#fn:dagger)^ But they can easily be subtler: forms are\nmisfiled or filled with typos, or the malfeasance is changed in such a\nway that it no longer appears on the form. Making these databases easier\nto read results only in easier-to-read lies.\n\nThree examples:\n\n-   Congress\u2019s operations are supposedly open to the public, but if you\n    visit the House floor (or if you follow what they\u2019re up to on one of\n    these transparency sites) you find that they appear to spend all\n    their time naming post offices. All the real work is passed using\n    emergency provisions and is tucked into subsections of innocuous\n    bills. (The bank bailouts were put in the Paul Wellstone Mental\n    Health Act.) Matt Taibbi\u2019s [*The Great\n    Derangement*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/038552062X) tells the\n    story.\n\n-   Many of these sites tell you who your elected official is, but what\n    impact does your elected official really have? For 40 years, people\n    in New York thought they were governed by their elected\n    officials\u2014their city council, their mayor, their governor. But as\n    Robert Caro revealed in [*The Power\n    Broker*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245), they were all\n    wrong. Power in New York was controlled by one man, a man who had\n    consistently lost every time he\u2019d tried to run for office, a man\n    nobody thought of as being in charge at all: Parks Commissioner\n    Robert Moses.\n\n-   Plenty of sites on the Internet will tell you who your\n    representative receives money from, but disclosed contributions are\n    just the tip of the iceberg. As Ken Silverstein points out in [his\n    series of pieces for\n    Harper\u2019s](http://www.harpers.org/subjects/KenSilverstein) (some of\n    which he covers in his book\n    [*Turkmeniscam*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X)), being a\n    member of Congress provides for endless ways to get perks and cash\n    while hiding where it comes from.\n\nFans of transparency try to skirt around this. \u201cOK,\u201d they say, \u201cbut\nsurely *some* of the data will be accurate. And even if it isn\u2019t, won\u2019t\nwe learn something from how people lie?\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s true, although\nit\u2019s hard to think of any good examples. (In fact, it\u2019s hard to think of\nany good examples of transparency work accomplishing anything, except\nperhaps for more transparency.) But everything has a cost.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars have been spent funding transparency\nprojects around the globe. That money doesn\u2019t come from the sky. The\nquestion isn\u2019t whether some transparency is better than none; it\u2019s\nwhether transparency is really the best way to spend these resources,\nwhether they would have a bigger impact if spent someplace else.\n\nI tend to think they would. All this money has been spent with the goal\nof getting a straight answer, not of doing anything about it. Without\nenforcement power, the most readable database in the world won\u2019t\naccomplish much\u2014even if it\u2019s perfectly accurate. So people go online and\nsee that all cars are dangerous and that all politicians are corrupt.\nWhat are they supposed to do then?\n\nSure, perhaps they can make small changes\u2014this politician gets slightly\nless oil money than that one, so I\u2019ll vote for her (on the other hand,\nmaybe she\u2019s just a better liar and gets her oil money funneled through\nPACs or foundations or lobbyists)\u2014but unlike the government, they can\u2019t\nsolve the bigger issue: a bunch of people reading a website can\u2019t force\ncar companies to make a safe car. You\u2019ve done nothing to solve the real\nproblem; you\u2019ve only made it seem more hopeless: all politicians are\ncorrupt, all cars are dangerous. What can you do?\n\nAn Alternative\n--------------\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic is that the Internet does provide something you can do. It\nhas made it vastly easier, easier than ever before, to form groups with\npeople and work together on common tasks. And it\u2019s through people coming\ntogether\u2014not websites analyzing data\u2014that real political progress can be\nmade.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve seen baby steps\u2014people copying what they see elsewhere and\ntrying to apply it to politics. Wikis seem to work well, so you build a\npolitical wiki. Everyone loves social networks, so you build a political\nsocial network. But these tools worked in their original setting because\nthey were trying to solve particular problems, not because they\u2019re\nmagic. To make progress in politics, we need to think best about how to\nsolve its problems, not simply copy technologies that have worked in\nother fields. Data analysis can be part of it, but it\u2019s part of a bigger\npicture. Imagine a team of people coming together to tackle some issue\nthey care about\u2014food safety, say. You can have technologists poring\nthrough safety records, investigative reporters making phone calls and\nsneaking into buildings, lawyers subpoenaing documents and filing\nlawsuits, political organizers building support for the project and\ncoordinating volunteers, members of Congress pushing for hearings on\nyour issues and passing laws to address the problems you uncover, and,\nof course, bloggers and writers to tell your stories as they unfold.\n\nImagine it: an investigative strike team, taking on an issue, uncovering\nthe truth, and pushing for reform. They\u2019d use technology, of course, but\nalso politics and the law. At best, a transparency law gets you one more\ndatabase you can look at. But a lawsuit (or congressional\ninvestigation)? You get to subpoena all the databases, as well as the\nsource records behind them, then interview people under oath about what\nit all means. You get to ask for what you need, instead of trying to\npredict what you may someday want.\n\nThis is where data analysis can be really useful. Not in providing\ndefinitive answers over the Web to random surfers, but in finding\nanomalies and patterns and questions that can be seized upon and\ninvestigated by others. Not in building finished products, but by\nengaging in a process of discovery. But this can be done only when\nmembers of this investigative strike team work in association with\nothers. They would do what it takes to accomplish their goals, not be\nhamstrung by arbitrary divisions between \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201cjournalism\u201d\nand \u201cpolitics.\u201d\n\nRight now, technologists insist that they\u2019re building neutral platforms\nfor anyone to find data on any issue. Journalists insist that they\u2019re\nobjective observers of the facts. And political types assume they\nalready know the answers and don\u2019t need to investigate further\nquestions. They\u2019re each in their own silo, unable to see the bigger\npicture.\n\nI certainly was. I care passionately about these issues\u2014I don\u2019t want\npoliticians to be corrupt; I don\u2019t want cars to kill people\u2014and as a\ntechnologist I\u2019d love to be able to solve them. That\u2019s why I got swept\nup in the promise of transparency. It seemed like just by doing the\nthings I knew how to do best\u2014write code, sift through databases\u2014I could\nchange the world.\n\nBut it just doesn\u2019t work. Putting databases online isn\u2019t a silver\nbullet, as nice as the word *transparency* may sound. But it was easy to\ndelude myself. All I had to do was keep putting things online and\nsomeone somewhere would find a use for them. After all, that\u2019s what\ntechnologists do, right? The World Wide Web wasn\u2019t designed for\npublishing the news\u2014it was designed as a neutral platform that could\nsupport anything from scientific publications to pornography.\n\nPolitics doesn\u2019t work like that. Perhaps at some point putting things on\nthe front page of the *New York Times* guaranteed that they would be\nfixed, but that day is long past. The pipeline of leak to investigation\nto revelation to report to reform has broken down. Technologists can\u2019t\ndepend on journalists to use their stuff; journalists can\u2019t depend on\npolitical activists to fix the problems they uncover. Change doesn\u2019t\ncome from thousands of people, all going their separate ways. Change\nrequires bringing people together to work on a common goal. That\u2019s hard\nfor technologists to do by themselves.\n\nBut if they do take that as their goal, they can apply all their talent\nand ingenuity to the problem. They can measure their success by the\nnumber of lives that have been improved by the changes they fought for,\nrather than the number of people who have visited their website. They\ncan learn which technologies actually make a difference and which ones\nare merely indulgences. And they can iterate, improve, and scale.\n\nTransparency can be a powerful thing, but not in isolation. So, let\u2019s\nstop passing the buck by saying our job is just to get the data out\nthere and it\u2019s other people\u2019s job to figure out how to use it. Let\u2019s\ndecide that our job is to fight for good in the world. I\u2019d love to see\nall these amazing resources go to work on *that*.\n\n*Thanks to Andy Oram and Andy Eggers for their insightful comments on\nearlier versions of this essay.*\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Many different strategies are tried \u2014 some just\nshake a jar, others call for help, some make specific small requests,\nand a fellow I saw today just kept sunnily repeating \u201ca nickel and a\nsmile will last a long while\u201d in an endearing tone. Others, however, try\nto earn their keep \u2014 playing music, doing tricks, selling special papers\nlike *Spare Change*.\n\nI have a strong urge to help out the first group, those who simply ask,\nbut helping the second has always struck me as odd. People tell me that\nit\u2019s better if the poor receive their money by doing work, because it\nlets them retain some dignity, but I\u2019ve never quite bought that. After\nall, how much dignity do you get when your income comes from people\npatronizingly pretending to buy a newspaper specially created for this\nruse?\n\nBut there\u2019s a much more serious problem with only giving the poor money\nfor doing things. It encourages them to think their worth as a person is\ndefined by their success in the capitalist economy.\n\nNow there is a grain of truth to this delusion. There are many useful\njobs for which society can compensate you. (Although even that, frankly,\nrequires a level of non-useful skill at fitting into the general\ncapitalist system.) But that\u2019s about it. There are many useful jobs that\nsociety doesn\u2019t compensate well. There are many useful people who can\u2019t\ndo any of those jobs because society never trained them or gave them the\nopportunities required. And even if, perchance, there existed someone\nwho cannot and even with training and opportunity could not do anything\nuseful, it seems clear to me that their simple existence as a human\nbeing endows them with some inalienable value. (If human beings didn\u2019t\nhave value, then we would have no one to do useful things *for*.)\n\nPeople on the street don\u2019t deserve our money because they can pretend to\ndo certain menial jobs. Nor should their sense of dignity be bound up in\ndoing them. Instead they, like everyone else, deserve our money because\nthey are *people* and if we cannot care for other people, then we have\nprecious little else.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1208674800.0, "postid": "moneyandworth", "internal_links": []}, "books2010": {"post_title": "2010 Review of Books", "tags": [], "post_content": "2010 Review of Books\n====================\n\nJanuary 3, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Previously:* [2009](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009),\n[2008](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books),\n[2007](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007),\n[2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)\n\nUnlinked means I recommend against getting it.

Ellsberg turns out to be an incredible writer and\n    he tells not only his own incredible story of the fight to release\n    the Pentagon Papers (did you know the *New York Times* actually\n    stole them from his house?), but, even more interestingly, recounts\n    a great deal of fascinating personal experience about what it was\n    like working with McNamara and Kissinger and trying to maintain your\n    sanity in the highest levels of government.\n\n    With the WikiLeaks cables in the news, this book is more relevant\n    than ever. And personally, I can\u2019t wait until Ellsberg\u2019s next book,\n    *The American Doomsday Machine*, comes out. ([Here\u2019s an\n    excerpt](http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/09/11_ellsberg_hundred_holocausts.php)\n    from back when he planned to publish it online; since then\n    [Bloomsbury snapped it\n    up](http://andyrossagency.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/daniel-ellsberg-and-the-american-doomsday-machine-2/).)\n\n    Also, be sure to check out [these\n    comments](http://crookedtimber.org/2009/12/22/i-dont-mind-who-writes-the-laws-of-the-future-if-i-can-write-and-sing-the-theme-tune/)\n    from Davies and Galbraith.\n\n2.  [Bright-Sided](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B003P2VDC4) by Barbara\n    Ehrenreich\n\n    A principled opposition to positive thinking has always been a\n    common Ehrenreich theme and here she expands it to book-length,\n    delivering exactly what you\u2019d expect. The good news is that it\u2019s\n    trenchant and witty, the bad news is that if you read a lot of\n    Ehrenreich you probably know just what\u2019s coming.\n\n3.  [Scientist in the Crib](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0688177883) by\n    Allison Gopnik, Andrew N. Meltzoff, Patricia K. Kuhl\n\n    Gopnik et al. summarize the findings of their wave of infant\n    research \u2014 namely that infants are trying to puzzle things out\n    through experiments rather than just sitting there waiting for their\n    brains to grow. Gopnik, as you\u2019d expect, is a good writer, but their\n    attempts to link their research with philosophy are a bit strained\n    and the research is still weak enough that the book doesn\u2019t quite\n    feel like it pays off the title.\n\n4.  Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely\n\n    Everybody\u2019s reading it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. A\n    collection of fairly mundane behavioral psychology experiments. If\n    you\u2019re really so deluded as to believe people aren\u2019t predictably\n    irrational, it\u2019s not clear to me how a mere book could possibly help\n    you.\n\n5.  *[A Bee Stung Me So I Killed All The\n    Fish](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/static/abeestungme.pdf)* [PDF] by\n    George Saunders\n\n    I love Saunders. I read [pretty much everything he\u2019s\n    written](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/User:AaronSw/George_Saunders)\n    this year. This collection features some of his sillier pieces.\n\n6.  [The Braindead Megaphone](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159448256X) by\n    George Saunders\n\n    Saunders is great, but he hasn\u2019t quite honed his nonfiction talents\n    the way he has with his fiction. Some fantastic pieces, some\n    fascinating ones, and some that don\u2019t quite work.\n\n7.  *[Prince of the Marshes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002V1GZFK)* by\n    Rory Stewart\n\n    I occasionally have this fantasy, while reading the news, that\n    whatever person I\u2019m reading about has been fired and, through some\n    miraculous fluke, I have been given their job. Would I make a hash\n    of it? Or, would by naive mind and outsider\u2019s expertise allow me to\n    do it in a fascinating new way?\n\n    In this book, Rory Stewart describes what happened when he was made\n    a colonial governor of a province in Iraq. Brilliant fellow that he\n    is, he does a remarkably good job all things considered, but also\n    writes a questioning, soul-searching, fascinating book about the\n    experience that highlights what an impossible task it really is.\n\n8.  *[False Profits: Recovering from the Bubble\n    Economy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0982417128)* by Dean Baker\n\n    A short, clear book on why the economy failed, who did it, and how\n    to set it right by someone who was absolutely right about it all\n    along. If you only want to read one book about the economic crisis,\n    this would be an excellent choice.\n\n9.  *[The Accidental Theorist](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393318877)*\n    by Paul Krugman\n\n    A collection of Krugman\u2019s columns for *Slate*. It was before he\n    really came off his neoliberal high, but after he learned to write,\n    so while they\u2019re not always right they\u2019re almost always delightful\n    (and *Slate* gave him a lot more freedom to be playful than the\n    *Times* does). A very fun book about a wide range of issues in\n    economics. (Here\u2019s [a nice\n    review](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/econ_articles/reviews/krugman_accidental.html)\n    from Brad DeLong.)\n\n10. [The Political Brain](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586485733) by\n    Drew Westen\n\n    A decent book that could have been great if it had a real editor.\n    There are really three things in here: 1) some fantastic examples of\n    what Democrats *should* say if they have any spine (they\u2019re the kind\n    of political propaganda Lakoff would write if Lakoff could write\n    political propaganda), 2) some pretty bogus fMRI experiments to give\n    the text in (1) the illusion of being backed in hard science, 3)\n    several hundred pages of pointless rambling and repetition. If only\n    an editor could have at least removed (3).\n\n11. *[Get Out The Vote](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0815732678)* by\n    Donald Green and Alan Gerber\n\n    Every year, thousands of Americans head out onto the streets to\n    knock on their neighbors\u2019 doors and remind them to vote. Does any of\n    it have any effect? Green and Gerber had the bright idea of running\n    an experiment to see: Randomize the houses and ask the canvassers to\n    knock on half of them and ignore the other half. Then, check the\n    voting records (which are public) to see how many people in each\n    group voted. The difference can tell you if you made a difference.\n\n    This brilliant idea sparked a whole field of experimental research\n    about getting out the vote, which Green and Gerber summarize in this\n    short book, aimed at some mix of scientists and political\n    professionals.\n\n12. *[Eating the Dinosaur](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416544216)* by\n    Chuck Klosterman\n\n    Absolutely fantastic. Could hardly put it down. Chuck Klosterman is\n    definitely in the running for greatest living essayist. The book is\n    a collection of essays, but not, as far as I can tell, essays that\n    were ever published anywhere else. They\u2019re each just magical gems\n    that fit together just perfectly. I even liked the stuff about\n    football (and I\u2019ve never seen a game of football).\n\n    I liked this so much I went on to read all his other books in\n    reverse chronological order:\n\n13. [Chuck Klosterman IV](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743284895) by\n    Chuck Klosterman\n\n    Great, but not quite *as* great.\n\n14. [Killing Yourself in Order to\n    Live](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743264460) by Chuck Klosterman\n\n    Merely interesting.\n\n15. [Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa\n    Puffs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743236017) by Chuck Klosterman\n\n    Pretty good.\n\n    But I could not read either *Downtown Owl* (his novel) or *Fargo\n    Rock City*. The rest I couldn\u2019t put down. I guess start with *Eating\n    the Dinosaur* and see how far you get.\n\n16. [Doubt is Their Product](http://books.theinfo.org/go/019530067X) by\n    David Michaels\n\n    There are a vast array of government agencies, like the EPA and\n    OSHA, whose job is to protect Americans by examining the science and\n    outlawing things that hurt people. But what if the bad guys get to\n    make up the science? David Michaels examines the whole industry of\n    scientists-for-hire that try to manufacture doubt about the harms\n    that big business commits. The title comes from a tobacco company\n    memo and the tobacco companies are infamous for trying to shed doubt\n    on the studies attacking their products, but the tactics they\n    invented have now spread to every little chemical additive.\n\n    Michaels is now head of OSHA. On the one hand, it\u2019s great that such\n    a corporate critic has such an influential position. On the other\n    hand, this book is written in the style you\u2019d expect from someone\n    who could become head of OSHA: it\u2019s cautious, not polemical, and\n    obsessed with proving the details, rather than the bigger picture.\n\n17. *[Why Not Socialism?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691143617)* by\n    G.A. Cohen\n\n    A great little book from the late philosopher Jerry Cohen. Not quite\n    as great as [his comments about the\n    shmoos](http://crookedtimber.org/2009/08/06/jerry-cohen-a-personal-appreciation/),\n    but a wonderful (and, sadly, all too rare) attempt to get people\n    thinking about what socialism really means and whether it would be\n    practical.\n\n18. [Free Schools](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2933773W/Free_schools)\n    by Jonathan Kozol\n\n    An angry little book not about how bad the school system is, like\n    Kozol\u2019s usual beat, but about the people trying to change it. Both\n    the folks, like Kozol, going into the inner city and trying to start\n    new schools and the others running away to the land to frolic in\n    freedom. Certainly a time capsule from the 1970s, but a fascinating\n    one.\n\n19. [Making Movies](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679756604) by Sidney\n    Lumet\n\n    A fairly self-absorbed book about what it means to make a movie.\n    Some decent details about the practicalities in here, but mixed in\n    with a lot of random musing and personal reflection.\n\n20. *[The Persistence of\n    Poverty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0300151365)* by Charles Karelis\n\n    I feel like I\u2019ve written so much about this book, but none of it\n    appears to have made it to this blog. A great little book, just\n    enough to explain one big idea and how it overturns what you think\n    about classical economics and poverty and much else besides. Here\u2019s\n    [a quick\n    bit](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/the-persistence-of-poverty/)\n    from Matt Yglesias on it.\n\n21. Caught Between Two Worlds: The Diary of a Lowell Mill Girl\n\n22. Mill by David Macaulay\n\n    I don\u2019t understand why everyone loves Macaulay so.\n\n23. Belles of New England\n\n24. *[The Industrial Worker](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0929587251)* by\n    Norman Ware\n\n    A fascinating history about how mill girls and shoemakers invented\n    socialism and fought for it in the early days of the republic,\n    before Jefferson\u2019s dream of independent men was crushed by the\n    onslaught of industrialization.\n\n25. *[Acme Novelty Library,\n    \\#19](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1897299567)* by Chris Ware\n\n    Chris Ware is magic. This book consists mostly of a chapter from the\n    work-in-progress *Rusty Brown*, which I was initially skeptical\n    about, but turns out to be just amazingly great. And *Building\n    Stories* is incredible too.\n\n    Ware\u2019s method is to publish a page each week or so in a weekly paper\n    (the Sunday *New York Times*, the *Chicago Reader*), then redraw the\n    entire chapter and send it out as an edition of the *Novelty\n    Library*, then redraw it a third time when the entire book is\n    published. So this is a way of getting intermediate results, but you\n    could just wait for the final books themselves (if they are ever\n    finished).\n\n26. [The Art of Lobbying](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0872894622) by\n    Bertram Levine\n\n    A guide by a practitioner, for practitioners. Not great, but you can\n    pick up a little bit of the flavor of the job from reading what the\n    insiders say.\n\n27. *[Making the Social World: The Structure of Human\n    Civilization](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195396170)* by John\n    Searle\n\n    Brilliant. [My review is\n    here](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dirfas).\n\n28. [The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies\n    Stronger](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B004A14W0Y) by Wilkinson and\n    Pickett\n\n    Not as good as I was hoping, but still a compelling case for\n    equality with a vast array of data.\n\n29. Women at Work\n\n30. [Loom and Spindle](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1176813617) by\n    Harriet Jane Hanson Robinson\n\n    A fantastic memoir of a fantastic time. Shows how radical even the\n    moderate mill girls were.\n\n31. *[Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value and How to Take Advantage of\n    It](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809078813)* by William Poundstone\n\n    Poundstone is one of the great science writers of all time. Here he\n    takes on behavioral economics at the very top of his game. Full of\n    fascinating ideas.\n\n32. [Influence](http://books.theinfo.org/go/006124189X) by Robert\n    Cialdini\n\n    Covers the usual results of the science on persuasion in a decent\n    and clear way.\n\n33. [Education and the Cult of\n    Efficiency](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226091503) by Raymond E.\n    Callahan\n\n    Proof that business has been trying to take over education for over\n    a century.\n\n34. [On Writing](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1439156816) by Stephen King\n\n    Nothing earth-shattering, but it turns out Stephen King is actually\n    a good writer. I honestly had no idea.\n\n35. *[Schooling in Capitalist\n    America](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465097189)* (reread) by Samuel\n    Bowles and Herbert Gintis\n\n    The best book on the real meaning of school.\n\n36. *[Becoming Attached](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)*\n    (reread) by Robert Karen\n\n    One of my favorite books of all time. Probably the best work of\n    science writing I\u2019ve ever read.\n\n37. *[Moral Politics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226467716)* (reread)\n    by George Lakoff\n\n    The best book on American politics.\n\n38. *[Unconditional Parenting](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743487486)*\n    (reread) by Alfie Kohn\n\n39. *[How Children Fail](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201484021)*\n    (reread) by John Holt\n\n    An amazing book on education.\n\n40. [The Lobbyists](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0812923146) by Jeffrey\n    Birnbaum\n\n41. [Dumbing Us Down](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0865714487) by John\n    Taylor Gatto\n\n42. [Winning Your Election the Wellstone\n    Way](http://books.theinfo.org/go/081665333X) by Jeff Blodgett and\n    Bill Lofy and others\n\n    Really just a more-detailed version of *Politics the Wellstone Way*.\n\n43. *[Bonfire of the Vanities](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312427573)*\n    by Tom Wolfe\n\n    Absolutely fantastic. A rare must-read novel \u2014 packed full of\n    information about society, journalism, activism, race, etc. I can\u2019t\n    convey just how good it really is. It\u2019s like *The Power Broker* of\n    fiction.\n\n44. [The Checklist Manifesto](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312430000) by\n    Atul Gawande\n\n    Not a bad book by any means, but its constrained focus means it\u2019s\n    not quite as thrilling as Gawande\u2019s other books. It ends up mostly\n    being a series of stories about how great checklists can be.\n    Checklists are interesting, but they\u2019re a very small piece of the\n    institutional change that this book should really be about. You get\n    a few hints at other pieces through the well-researched examples,\n    but they\u2019re only hints.\n\n45. The Revisionists Revised by Diane Ravitch\n\n    Eminently skimmable \u2014 Ravitch barely even tries to mount an\n    argument. Instead she just sort of fumes for a hundred pages or so\n    at the radical scholars who dared to point out the invention of\n    school wasn\u2019t so nobly motivated. Well, she\u2019s come a long way \u2014 now\n    she\u2019s basically one of them. ([See this piece on her\n    reversal](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/thewrongstuff/archive/2010/05/17/diane-ravitch-on-being-wrong.aspx).)\n\n46. [Free at Last: The Sudbury Valley\n    School](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1888947004) by Daniel Greenberg\n\n    Sudbury has some aspects of magic and nothing conveys them better\n    than this book.\n\n47. [Learning all the Time](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201550911) by\n    John Holt\n\n48. [Political Polling](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0742561313) by\n    Jeffrey Stonecash\n\n    Has some decent stuff on the business side of things \u2014 how to write\n    polling reports and get clients and so on.\n\n49. [The Big Short](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393338827) by Michael\n    Lewis\n\n    Oh, what to say about this book? It\u2019s well-written, as you\u2019d expect,\n    though no knockout. It tells a fascinating story about some aspects\n    of the crisis, but goes far from unravelling the whole thing.\n\n50. *[How to Win Friends and Influence\n    People](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1439167346)* (reread) by Dale\n    Carnegie\n\n    There\u2019s a reason this is a classic. It articulates a way of dealing\n    with people, founded on concern and empathy, and convincingly argues\n    that this kind style is actually the more productive one for getting\n    things done. Instead of yelling at people to do things, you make\n    them *want* to help you. And the book itself is a genius exemplar of\n    this practice. Instead of berating you for being a jerk, like most\n    people would, it persuades you to *want* to change.\n\n51. *[The Immortal Life of Henrietta\n    Lacks](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400052173)* by Rebecca Skloot\n\n    Everyone has praised this book, and for good reason \u2014 it deftly\n    interweaves an incredible story of science with the heartbreaking\n    tragedy of the people science studies. Nothing earthshattering, but\n    a great piece of writing.\n\n52. [The Design of Design](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201362988) by\n    Fred Brooks\n\n    No deep lasting insights, but it is fascinating to watch Brooks\n    struggle with these questions and it helps you struggle as well.\n\n53. [REDACTED]\n\n54. [The Case Against Standardized\n    Tests](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0325008930) by Alfie Kohn\n\n    If you need more reasons to hate standardized tests, this book is\n    full of them.\n\n55. [When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a\n    Fish](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374532419) by Martin Gardner\n\n    In memoriam. In the same way that the spirit of Lenny Bruce passed\n    through Bill Hicks and now Louis CK, the ghost of Feynman passed to\n    Martin Gardner. His wit and curiosity, combined with a gift for\n    explanation, did more than almost anyone to promote a genuine\n    appreciation for math and science. This essay collection was his\n    last book. (Although I\u2019m sure many, many more will come\n    posthumously.)\n\n56. [Class War?: What Americans Really Think about Economic\n    Inequality](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226644553) by Benjamin Page\n    and Lawrence Jacobs\n\n    If the state of politics gets you down about your fellow man, this\n    well-researched scientific book will persuade you that even\n    Americans are egalitarians at heart.\n\n57. [Getting to Yes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140157352) by Roger\n    Fisher and William Ury\n\n    This book is full of alternate strategies to try, but has very\n    little on the key negotiation question of what to do about\n    distributing the surplus.\n\n58. [Expert Political Judgment](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691128715)\n    by Philip Tetlock\n\n    This book is kind of a bore to read, but the story it tells is\n    fascinating, so [just read Louis Menand\u2019s\n    summary](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1)\n    instead.\n\n59. [101 Things I Learned in Business\n    School](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446550280) by Michael W. Preis\n    with Matthew Frederick\n\n    A sweet, short book with cute pictures. Smart idea for a series.\n\n60. [The Way We Were?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/087078417X)\n    [[online](http://tcf.org/publications/1998/9/pb196)] by Richard\n    Rothstein\n\n    A fantastic debunking of the \u201ckids were so much smarter back then\u201d\n    myth.\n\n61. [The Matthew Effect](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231149484) by\n    Daniel Rigney\n\n    Short and unmemorable.\n\n62. [Taking Economic Seriously](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262014181)\n    by Dean Baker\n\n    A nice little summary of Dean\u2019s big ideas.\n\n63. *[The Meaning of David\n    Cameron](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1846944562)* by Richard Seymour\n\n    A short book on what\u2019s happened to British politics from a radical\n    perspective.\n\n64. *[Managing to Change the\n    World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0615273416)* by Allison Green and\n    Jerry Hauser\n\n    The best book on the practicalities of management I\u2019ve ever read.\n    Whereas most books focus on vague and meaningless advice, this book\n    is clear about the nuts and bolts.\n\n65. *[Workers in a Labyrinth](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0876638175)*\n    by Robert Jackall\n\n    Not as great as my favorite book of all-time, Jackall\u2019s *Moral\n    Mazes*, but a fascinating look at how normal people make sense of\n    their daily work lives.\n\n66. Disconnect by Morris Fiorina\n\n    Fiorina has no idea what he\u2019s talking about in this one; it\u2019s\n    completely ridiculous. There was a long period in American politics\n    where, to prevent blacks from voting, southern whites excluded\n    blacks from the Democratic party primary and then always voted for\n    the Democratic nominee in the general. Blacks could legally vote,\n    but only in the general, when it didn\u2019t make any difference.\n\n    The result was that a whole lot of racist, conservative politicians\n    ended up in the Democratic Party and so politics appeared less\n    polarized \u2014 there were conservatives Democrats (and some liberal\n    Republicans) and the conservatives and the liberals could work\n    \u201cacross party lines\u201d to get things done.\n\n    Eventually the Supreme Court outlawed this noxious practice and the\n    south started sending Republicans to Congress instead. That led to\n    the conservatives leaving the Democratic party (and then the liberal\n    Republicans getting kicked out too) and now when liberals or\n    conservatives all work together, they only need to do so within one\n    party. The result is what appears to be an increase in party\n    polarization. Instead of a couple Democratic liberals and a couple\n    Republican liberals writing a bill, you just get a bunch of\n    Democratic liberals writing a bill.\n\n    This is such an obvious explanation and MoFi does his best to ignore\n    it, looking everywhere but the obvious place so he can wonder about\n    the dangers of polarization.\n\n67. [The Girl with the Dragon\n    Tattoo](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307454541) (1 of 3) by Stieg\n    Larsson\n\n    This book has no deep point to make, Nora Ephron has [ably\n    chronicled its stylistic\n    oddities](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2010/07/05/100705sh_shouts_ephron),\n    and the plot is more bizarre than compelling. Yet I couldn\u2019t put it\n    down. Indeed, I dare say I enjoyed it.\n\n68. [The Girl who Played with\n    Fire](http://books.theinfo.org/go/030745455X) (2 of 3) by Stieg\n    Larsson\n\n69. [The Girl who Kicked Over the Hornet\u2019s\n    Nest](http://books.theinfo.org/go/030726999X) (3 of 3) by Stieg\n    Larsson\n\n    These two tell a different, and in some ways more interesting story\n    than the first one, but it\u2019s not enough to change my fundamental\n    evaluation.\n\n    However, I do much prefer the original titles, which translate\n    roughly to: *Men Who Hate Women*, *The Girl Who Played with Fire*,\n    and *The Exploding Social Safety Net*. I guess it\u2019s nice when that\n    sort of thing can be a bestseller.\n\n70. *[The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who\n    Read Them](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374532184)* by Elif Batuman\n\n    Hilarious, brilliant, fantastic. There\u2019s no justification for this\n    book being as good as it is. Even I wasn\u2019t interested in reading a\n    book about Russian literary scholars, but it\u2019s just incredible good\n    and I\u2019m glad I did.\n\n71. *[This is Your Country on\n    Drugs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0470643897)* by Ryan Grim\n\n    I would not have thought the world needed another book on drugs, but\n    this one turns out to be basically perfect. Comprehensive, erudite,\n    funny, and realistic \u2014 Grim definitely inhales.\n\n72. [Scott Pilgrim\u2019s Precious Little\n    Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664084) (1 of 6) by Bryan Lee\n    O\u2019Malley\n\n73. [Scott Pilgrim vs. The\n    World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664122) (2 of 6) by Bryan Lee\n    O\u2019Malley\n74. [Scott Pilgrim and the Infinite\n    Sadness](http://books.theinfo.org/go/193266422X) (3 of 6) by Bryan\n    Lee O\u2019Malley\n75. [Scott Pilgrim Gets It\n    Together](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664491) (4 of 6) by Bryan\n    Lee O\u2019Malley\n76. [Scott Pilgrim vs. The\n    Universe](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1934964107) (5 of 6) by Bryan\n    Lee O\u2019Malley\n77. [Scott Pilgrim\u2019s Finest\n    Hour](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1934964387) (6 of 6) by Bryan Lee\n    O\u2019Malley\n\n    You should *definitely* see the movie and then, if you do see it,\n    it\u2019s worth reading the books. The books are much deeper and darker\n    than the movie otherwise lets on. You realize that the film you saw\n    as an example of joy and exuberance is actually incredibly\n    depressing.\n\n    By contrast, we will just forget that someone made a movie of\n    *Bonfire of the Vanities*. Yeek.\n\n78. Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson\n\n79. *[Delivering Happiness](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446563048)* by\n    Tony Hsieh\n\n    This book is more the story of Hsieh\u2019s insane journey toward\n    creating Zappos than the business advice book it looks like, but\n    that\u2019s OK because it\u2019s an incredible story and Hsieh\u2019s exuberant\n    retelling makes it impossible to put down.\n\n80. [Meta Math!](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400077974) by Gregory\n    Chaitin\n\n    Chaitin makes an obscure field you\u2019ve never heard of like\n    Algorithmic Information Theory sound interesting and fun, even if\n    you don\u2019t know any math.\n\n81. [Philosophy in a New\n    Century](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521731585) by John Searle\n\n    A collection of some great essays by Searle.\n\n82. The Essential Drucker by Peter Drucker\n\n    Drucker sounds like the kind of person I should like, but I\u2019ve never\n    actually liked him.\n\n83. Socks by Beverly Cleary\n\n84. Beezus and Ramona by Beverly Cleary\n85. Ramona the Pest by Beverly Cleary\n86. Ramona the Brave by Beverly Cleary\n\n    I read these to the seven-year-old, at her insistence. They weren\u2019t\n    great, but they were at least tolerable, unlike some of the other\n    stuff she likes.\n\n87. XKCD, vol. 0 by Randall Munroe\n\n    You no doubt already read xkcd online. Yet apparently many people\n    also bought this paper copy. And they said print was dead!\n\n88. [The Promise: President Obama, Year\n    One](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1847398065) by Jonathan Alter\n\n    No great revelations, but it is shocking how little actual thought\n    goes on in the Obama White House.\n\n89. *[Microeconomics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691126380)* by Samuel\n    Bowles\n\n    A textbook that totally upends the field of classical economics.\n    Sadly, it can be a bit hard to follow, but I wrote [summaries of it\n    here](http://groups.google.com/group/bowles-l/topics).\n\n90. *[All Art is Propaganda: Critical\n    Essays](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0156033070)* by George Orwell\n    (with introduction by Keith Gessen)\n\n    Orwell is magic.\n\n91. [Toyota Production System](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0915299143)\n    by Taiichi Ohno\n\n    It\u2019s hard to find a better book that describes what lean production,\n    in its original sense, is all about than this translated work from\n    its creator. I hope that Ohno one day gets the recognition he\n    deserves: as one of the world\u2019s first pioneers in what is\n    undoubtedly the greatest human art form (with sex running a close\n    second).\n\n92. [Freedom](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312600844) by Jonathan\n    Franzen\n\n    Flashes of greatness mixed with strings of ridiculousness. (This is\n    Franzen\u2019s Great American Novel, in case you hadn\u2019t heard.) Could\n    have been truly great if Franzen had a great editor, but instead all\n    his indulgences were left in. It\u2019s certainly no competition for DFW.\n    (Sorry, Franzen!)\n\n93. [The Machine that Changed the World: The Story of Lean\n    Production\u2014Toyota\u2019s Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now\n    Revolutionizing World\n    Industry](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743299795) by James P.\n    Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel Roos\n\n    Not bad, but feels a bit like reading a book by a bunch of blind men\n    trying to explain the elephant charging toward them.\n\n94. Conscience of a Liberal by Paul Krugman\n\n    Did I really read this book? I don\u2019t remember it at all.\n\n95. [How to Become a Scandal](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805089799) by\n    Laura Kipnis\n\n    Kipnis\u2019 writing is fun, as always, but there\u2019s no real insight here.\n\n96. [Poisoned for Pennies: The Economics of Toxics and\n    Precaution](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1597264016) by Frank\n    Ackerman\n\n    A fantastic book on the serious trouble with using mathematical\n    cost-benefit analyses to try to decide when to protect the\n    environment.\n\n97. Exit, Voice, and Loyalty by Albert O. Hirschman\n\n    A disappointment. Perhaps all its insights have become common\n    knowledge since then.\n\n98. REDACTED\n\n99. [Beyond the Hoax](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0199561834) by Alan\n    Sokal\n\n    Alan Sokal returns again with a book collecting and integrating his\n    papers on the philosophy of science (although there is still some\n    repetition). Sokal\u2019s clear thinking on difficult philosophical\n    issues is always appreciated, but this time around I\u2019m convinced\n    that [he\u2019s wrong about the Edinburgh\n    set](http://qblog.aaronsw.com/post/1153051459/edinburgh-revisited).\n    The rest of it is great, though, especially if you haven\u2019t read it\n    before. (There\u2019s also some good newish stuff too, including some\n    stuff about *Prophets Facing Backward*.)\n\n100. *[Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective\n    Joy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805057242)* by Barbara Ehrenreich\n\n    Ehrenreich makes a convincing case for the ecstatic tradition in\n    American life. My only regret is that it lacks a chapter on raves.\n\n101. [The Mind-Body Problem](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140172459) by\n    Rebecca Goldstein\n\n    A nice book about the problem with marrying a genius. See also: the\n    film *Whatever Works*.\n\n102. REDACTED\n\n103. [The \\$12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of\n    Contemporary Art](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0230620590) by Don\n    Thompson\n\n    This is another book about a weird subject that goes into too much\n    detail. Thompson gives a decent overview of the art market, but then\n    spends too much time getting into obscure detail about the people\n    involved. Modern art sure is weird, though.\n\n104. [The Cartoon Introduction to\n    Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809094819) by Grady Klein\n    and Yoram Bauman\n\n    Funny (especially the intro) and some basic economics, but nothing\n    stupendous on either front.\n\n105. *[When Brute Force Fails](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691148643)*\n    by Mark A. R. Kleiman\n\n    A fantastic book. More gushing [in my\n    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bruteforce).\n\n106. [Money for Nothing](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416597700) by John\n    Gillespie and David Zweig\n\n    A quick read on why corporate boards suck so very much.\n\n107. [Ha\u2019Penny](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0765358085) (2 of 3) by Jo\n    Walton\n\n108. [Half a Crown](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0765316218) (3 of 3) by\n    Jo Walton\n\n    A good fun detective story combined with interesting speculative\n    fiction. (I read the first book, *Farthing*, years ago.)\n\n109. [Reason and Rationality](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691139008) by\n    Jon Elster\n\n    Very, very short.\n\n110. [An Object of Beauty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446573647) by\n    Steve Martin\n\n    More on the art market. Martin is not a bad novelist, considering\n    everything else he is, but I doubt I would have read the book if it\n    had a different author\u2019s name on the cover.\n\n111. [Shopgirl](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0786891076) by Steve Martin\n\n    Turns out to be basically the same book, except much creepier since\n    you realize Martin\u2019s basically just using the book to work through\n    his guilt about screwing over younger women.\n\n112. *[Good to Great](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0066620996)* by Jim\n    Collins\n\n    Most business books consist of a bunch of wacky ideas dressed up\n    with even wackier names and presented as the Next Big Thing. Jim\n    Collins greatly improves the genre, by replacing the wacky ideas\n    with actual science. (Unfortunately, he continues the tradition of\n    wacky names.)\n\n    Collins and his team picked out all Fortune 500 companies that\n    sustained 4x market returns for more than 15 years (the great\n    companies) and went back to find the transition point where they\n    went from earning normal-market returns to their 4x returns. Then\n    they found the most similar company at that transition point and\n    used it as a control. They examined what differed between the great\n    companies and the controls and describe it here. Of course, you have\n    to trust Collins to pick out the right lessons, but the ones he\n    chooses seem like very good ones.\n\n113. [Good to Great and the Social\n    Sector](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0977326403) by Jim Collins\n\n    A short little appendix describing how to apply these principles to\n    non-profits.\n\n114. [Built to Last](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060516402) by Jim\n    Collins and Jerry Porras\n\n    This book is very similar to *Good to Great* except it uses even\n    worse science and even worse names. (Clock building? Really? Can\u2019t\n    we just call it institution building?) Just read *Good to Great* \u2014\n    the important stuff from this book is presented in its last chapter\n    anyway.\n\n115. Beyond Entrepreneurship by Jim Collins and William C. Lazier\n\n    This book has pretty much no science (although fewer silly names as\n    well). It\u2019s just a lazier version of *Built to Last*.\n\n116. [You Lost Me There](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594487634) by\n    Rosencrans Baldwin\n\n    I knew Rosencrans had a novel out, but I was shocked to see it at\n    the checkout counter. But it\u2019s great!\n\n117. Bigfoot: I Not Dead by Graham Roumieu\n\n    Not funny.\n\n118. [The Thick of It: The Missing DoSAC\n    Files](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0571272541) by the writers of\n    *The Thick of It*\n\n    Not that funny. (*The Thick of It* is one of the top 5 great TV\n    shows of all-time, though.)\n\n119. *[The Lifecycle of Software\n    Objects](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1596063173)*\n    [[online](http://subterraneanpress.com/index.php/magazine/fall-2010/fiction-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects-by-ted-chiang/)]\n    by Ted Chiang\n\n    Read it! Even people who know much more about sci-fi than me agree\n    this is one of the great science fiction books of all time. It\u2019s a\n    novel about the ethical issues with AI.\n\n120. [Dr. Horrible and Other Horrible\n    Stories](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1595825770) by Zack Whedon\n\n    Definitely funny, though not as great as the show.\n\n121. [Wrestling With Moses](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400066743) by\n    Anthony Flint\n\n    A decent attempt at a biography of Jane Jacobs, though I would have\n    wanted more detail on how she actually did what she did. Caro he is\n    not \u2014 either in writing or research.\n\n122. *[Short: Walking Tall When You\u2019re Not Tall At\n    All](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159643323X)* by John Schwartz\n\n    Surely you\u2019ve heard about the studies showing short people don\u2019t\n    make as much as tall people. John Schwartz set out to write a book\n    to cheer kids up about this fact, but looking into them he found it\n    wasn\u2019t a fact at all. The result is a model of self-help through\n    science and media criticism. Schwartz playfully teaches you enough\n    math and science to be able to debunk the studies and enough\n    personal advice to make a life on your own terms.\n\n*Disclosures:* I know Rory Stewart, Dean Baker, John Schwartz, Ryan\nGrim, Randall Munroe, and Charles Karelis. Baker and Karelis provided me\nwith free copies. Ryan Grim and John Schwartz have written about me in\nother forums.\n\nIn the future, I think I should probably do this monthly instead of one\nhuge yearly installment.\n", "external_links":

Books\n========================\n\nApril 19, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Previously:* [2010](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010),\n[2009](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009),\n[2008](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books),\n[2007](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007),\n[2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)\n\n2011 was a stressful year, in many ways, and so for large parts of it I\ndid not really read. [Instead, I\ntracked](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As8ovKAdyK-hdGJEd3h3eWpjaWhHRndFS3loOW1sTmc&hl=en_US#gid=0)\nhow many books I started and how many pages I got through each, for a\ntotal of 112 books started, 70 finished, and over 20,000 pages read. Not\nup to my usual standards. Nonetheless\u2026\n\n**Key:** Books in bold are those that were so great my heart leaps at\nthe chance to tell you about them even now. If you only have time to\nread some of this, read those.\n\n1.  *[The Net Delusion](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586488740)* by\n    Evgeny Morozov\n\n    Surprisingly well-written and well-researched.\n\n2.  *Managing Oneself* by Peter Drucker\n\n3.  ***[The Halo Effect](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743291263)* by\n    Phil Rosenzweig**\n\n    [Last year](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010), I recommended\n    *Good to Great*, calling it \u201cactual science\u201d. [Dave Bridgeland\n    quickly corrected me](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010#c8)\n    and recommended this book, which is vastly better. Not only does it\n    systematically debunk the pretensions to science in *Good to Great*\n    and the other management bestsellers in an absolutely delightful\n    manner, it provides a short but very thought-provoking discussion of\n    strategy in its own right.\n\n    You can mock the banality of its recommendations, but there\u2019s no\n    question: this book is well worth it just for the way it encourages\n    habits of genuine scientific thought. I knew I never should have\n    fallen so low as to trust a business book!\n\n4.  *[The Farnsworth Invention](http://books.theinfo.org/go/057366286X)*\n    by Aaron Sorkin\n\n    Clearly not Sorkin\u2019s best, but short and fun. Also interesting to\n    see how Sorkin plays with the fourth wall in a play format.\n\n5.  ***[The Trial](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805209999)* by Franz\n    Kafka (translated by Breon Mitchell)**\n\n    A deep and magnificent work. I\u2019d not really read much Kafka before\n    and had grown up led to believe that it was a paranoid and\n    hyperbolic work, dystopian fiction in the style of George Orwell.\n    Yet I read it and found it was precisely accurate \u2014 every single\n    detail perfectly mirrored my own experience. This isn\u2019t fiction, but\n    documentary.\n\n    *Spoilers follow.*\n\n    The bulk of the book is about K trying to find someone to fight his\n    case for him, and failing miserably. As an individual in a world of\n    bureaucracies, he concludes [there\u2019s no\n    substitute](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/delegation) but to do the\n    work himself.\n\n    This is set against the backdrop of his \u201cday job\u201d at the bank \u2014\n    about as characteristic a bureaucracy as you can imagine. The bank,\n    by contrast, has no difficulty finding people to do its work for it.\n    Even when K slacks off or gets distracted, the bank continues\n    chugging along just fine \u2014 as seen in the vice president who leaps\n    to take K\u2019s work from him. (Compare: The independent lawyer is under\n    no such pressure to actually get K\u2019s work done.)\n\n    A vivid illustration that bureaucracies, once they get started,\n    continue doing whatever mindless thing they\u2019ve been set up to do,\n    regardless of whether the people in them particularly want to do it\n    or whether it\u2019s even a good idea. At the same time, individual\n    people have an incredibly hard time executing long-term or\n    large-scale tasks on their own, even when they\u2019re quite motivated.\n\n    But what of the priest? The priest tells K a story about how as an\n    individual in a bureaucracy, it\u2019s a losing game to try to ask\n    permission. You have to persuade your boss, your boss\u2019s boss, and\n    your boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss (so terribly powerful that your boss can\u2019t\n    even bear to look at him). If you wait for your request to be\n    approved by the chain of command, it won\u2019t happen at all.\n\n    K argues with the priest about how horribly unfair this is: isn\u2019t\n    your boss (the individual) doing the wrong thing somehow? The priest\n    maintains there are many different theories about this question of\n    individual responsibility. But K is missing the larger point: this\n    is just how bureaucracy works.\n\n    K takes the lesson to heart and decides to stop fighting the system\n    and just live his life without asking for permission. It goes\n    well\u2026for a while. But it still seems a better option than the\n    alternatives.\n\n6.  *The Great Stagnation* by Tyler Cowen\n\n    A dreadful little book, which boils down to nothing more than a vast\n    tract of economic illiteracy. Take just the insanity that is chapter\n    2. Cowen takes as his dictum:\n\n    > The larger the role of government in the economy, the more the\n    > published figures for GDP growth are overstating improvements in\n    > our living standard.\n\n    For example, as government-insured health care takes up a larger\n    proportion of our country\u2019s spending, we can\u2019t accurately measure\n    how our living standards are improving since it\u2019s paid for at set\n    rates by government instead of through a competitive market process\n    to set accurate prices.\n\n    But, as any economist should realize, our standard of living is\n    *never* appropriately measured through prices, because of consumer\n    surplus. The *whole point* of a competitive economy is to create\n    this disconnect. Let\u2019s say a chair greatly improves my standard of\n    living and I would pay \\$10,000 for one. In a competitive market,\n    different chair providers compete for my money by offering a lower\n    price, eventually driving the price of the chair down to the cost of\n    production.\n\n    Has my \u2018living standard\u2019 [*sic*] thereby decreased? Of course not!\n    In fact, it has increased since I can buy several chairs (while\n    still getting thousands of dollars in consumer surplus!). It\u2019s\n    insane to blame this on government.\n\n    Cowen\u2019s other arguments are similarly ignorant. For example, he\n    tries to claim that the reason we\u2019re in a recession, \u201cnot filling\n    government coffers or supporting many families\u201d, is because \u201cour\n    major innovations are sprining up in sectors where a lot of work is\n    done by machines, not by human beings. \u2026 That is one reason why we\n    have been seeing a \u2018jobless recovery.\u2019\u201d (L503)\n\n    Nonsense on stilts. [The Federal Reserve\n    decides](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs) how many people\n    will have jobs, iPads have nothing to do with it.\n\n    This book\u2019s popularity is a sad sign of how ignorance triumphs when\n    it benefits the powerful.\n\n7.  *[Lifted](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B004K1F9KG)* by Evan Ratliff\n    ([iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-atavist/id408059276?mt=8&ls=1))\n\n    A fast, fun real-life heist story.\n\n8.  *[Getting Things Done](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142000280)* by\n    David Allen [reread]\n\n    Still good, though not worth starting a cult over. Its insights are\n    more psychological than anything else.\n\n9.  *[Private Firms Working in the Public\n    Interest](http://www.rand.org/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD212.html)*\n    by Abigail Bugbee Brown\n\n    Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Olympus \u2014 why is there so much accounting\n    fraud? Why isn\u2019t this stuff caught? In this serious but\n    briskly-written work, Abigail Brown explains the incredible story of\n    how accounting firms actually work. Paid by the people they\u2019re\n    supposed to be auditing, accounting firms have developed an\n    elaborate culture of corruption, letting them aid and abet the most\n    egregious forms of dishonesty.\n\n    (Disclosure: Ms. Brown and I were lab fellows together at the\n    Harvard Center for Ethics.)\n\n10. *QED* by Peter Parnell\n\n    Not bad, by any stretch, but on the page, for anyone who\u2019s familiar\n    with Feynman\u2019s actual writings, this can\u2019t help but feel thin.\n\n11. *Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself* with David Foster\n    Wallace\n\n    After a great artist dies, there comes a point where the barrel of\n    work that can be published posthumously seems like it\u2019s running dry\n    (Elliot Smith\u2019s *New Moon*, Kafka\u2019s *Office Papers*). Publishing the\n    transcript of a rambling conversation with DFW as a book would seem\n    to be similarly stretching.\n\n    But, like the others, it turns out to be appreciated all the same.\n    DFW is delightful and witty and it\u2019s fascinating to see how much of\n    his linguistic creativity and charm wasn\u2019t the result of any special\n    effort but simply his natural form to speech. He must have been such\n    a delight to spend time with.\n\n    The problem is that the editor of this volume, David Lipsky, is\n    apparently a dreadful writer who is deluded into thinking he\u2019s a\n    great one. Taking DFW\u2019s polite words of support as deep praise, he\n    is not shy about sharing his \u2018gifts\u2019 via overwrought introductions\n    and interpolations. The result is an infuriating combination of\n    glorious rants from DFW cut with ignorant and ill-written\n    speculation by someone desperate to show off. (Though I don\u2019t recall\n    Lipsky\u2019s recent piece about DFW being so bad, so maybe he merely\n    needed an editor\u2026or was told to pad the book out with random\n    asides.)\n\n12. *Inside WikiLeaks* by Daniel Domscheit-Berg\n\n13. *[Brainiac](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0812974999)* by Ken Jennings\n\n    Who knew Ken Jennings was so funny? A witty and delightful book,\n    though obviously not one that\u2019s anything more than trivial.\n\n14. *[From Dictatorship to\n    Democracy](http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html)* by Gene\n    Sharp\n\n    A short but impressive guide to how to run a democratic revolution.\n    Reportedly rather influential and certainly provides an interesting\n    structure for thought.\n\n15. *[Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime\n    Underground](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307588696)* by Kevin\n    Poulsen\n\n    A fun and intriguing book. Poulsen writes in a restrained style, but\n    the pace is fast and the images are vivid and the technology seems\n    pretty right-on.\n\n    (Disclosure: Kevin Poulsen and I worked together at Wired.)\n\n16. *[Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund\n    Manager](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0051BNV4U)* by Anonymous Hedge\n    Fund Manager and Keith Gessen (with n+1)\n\n    An annotated transcript of a series of interviews between the\n    brilliant literary writer Keith Gessen and a sympathetic and\n    polymathic hedge fund manager. The hedge fund manager tries to\n    provide some insight into what his world is like, in real time as\n    it\u2019s collapsing, but Gessen\u2019s questioning typically isn\u2019t detailed\n    enough to get a very vivid picture. HFM\u2019s stories were thrilling as\n    things happened but with distance they seem somewhat blurred; it\u2019s\n    harder to fit them in now that we think we understand what happened.\n    They\u2019re both delightful characters, though, enough to still make the\n    book a decent read.\n\n17. *[The Watchman: The Twisted Life and Crimes of Serial Hacker Kevin\n    Poulsen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316528579)* by Jonathan\n    Littman\n\n    Whatever ese you want to say about Kevin Poulsen, he was certainly\n    funny. Littman provides a vivid retelling of his strange story. I\u2019m\n    told Poulsen denies most of what\u2019s in this book, so it may not have\n    much value as documentary, but as entertainment it\u2019s pretty good.\n\n18. *Tourist Season* by Carl Hiassen\n\n19. *Strip Tease* by Carl Hiassen\n20. *Skinny Dip* by Carl Hiassen\n\n    Carl Hiassen writes murder mysteries with a political bent. They\u2019re\n    fun airport reading but it\u2019s hard to justify them as much more than\n    that.\n\n21. *[Scoop](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316926108)* by Evelyn Waugh\n\n    This book, the source of the name *The Daily Beast*, is a vicious\n    satire of journalism. It has some quite witty and biting moments,\n    including some I\u2019ve found myself referring back to, but I\u2019m not sure\n    it holds together as literature.\n\n22. *The Age of WikiLeaks* by Greg Mitchell\n\n    An good, well-written summary of the story so far, but nothing more\n    than that.\n\n23. *JSTOR: A History* by Roger C. Schonfeld\n\n24. *Team Rodent* by Carl Hiassen\n\n    A very short book packed full of muck about the Disney Corporation.\n    Fun stuff, but it comes off as very light \u2014 basically just a list of\n    stories Hiassen seems to have picked up in his years of living\n    nearby.\n\n25. *Shots* by David Fenton\n\n26. *At a Slight Angle to the Universe* by William Bowen\n27. *[The Honor Code](http://books.theinfo.org/go/039334052X)* by K.\n    Anthony Appiah\n\n    A collection of interesting stories about how social revolutions\n    have happened. Appiah tries to tie them together with a story about\n    honor, but I think that\u2019s ultimately less interesting and persuasive\n    than just reading the stories themselves.\n\n28. *The Case of the Speluncean Explorers: Nine New Stories* by Peter\n    Suber\n\n29. *The Story of Colors* by Subcomandante Marcos\n\n    Absurdly, a children\u2019s book by Subcomandante Marcos. As weird as\n    you\u2019d expect, but not as good as you\u2019d hope.\n\n30. *[The New-York Historical Society: Lessons from One Nonprofit\u2019s Long\n    Struggle for Survival](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0787901873)* by\n    Kevin Guthrie\n\n    A compellingly-written and fascinatingly-told story of how the\n    New-York Historical Society, a grand old museum housing countless\n    invaluable treasures, was so consistently financially mismanaged\n    that despite its greatness it found itself constantly on the verge\n    of financial ruin. Clearly written as a cautionary tale for those\n    who would run a non-profit.\n\n31. *[The Pale King](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316074233)* by David\n    Foster Wallace\n\n    In his notes, David Foster Wallace described this unfinished book\n    about boredom as one where \u201csomething big threatens to happen but\n    doesn\u2019t actually happen\u201d. As a result, it\u2019s probably less unfinished\n    than it feels. It has the usual DFW virtuosity with language\n    (including some truly poetic sections) and a tax-related premise\n    that somehow captures the entirety of this political moment the same\n    way *Infinite Jest* captured the cultural one, but there\u2019s certainly\n    nothing in the way of a plot the way there was in *Infinite Jest*.\n\n32. *[Bossypants](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316056863)* by Tina Fey\n\n    This book is like a literary cupcake: a small bombshell of sugar\n    without very much in the way of substance. I believe I read the\n    whole thing while sitting in an airport terminal and while I enjoyed\n    it and laughed, it\u2019s hard to claim I took anything away from the\n    experience.\n\n33. ***[Poor Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586487981)* by\n    Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo**\n\n    God, what a book! *Poor Economics* is a series of tales of\n    foreigners trying to save the far-flung poor, while failing to\n    realize not only that their developed-country ideas are terrible\n    disasters in practice, but also that everything they\u2019ve learned to\n    think of as solid \u2014 even something as simple as measuring distance \u2014\n    is far more fraught, and complex, and political than they ever could\n    have imagined. It\u2019s a stunning feeling to have the basic building\n    blocks of your world questioned and crumbled before you \u2014 and a\n    powerful lesson in the value of self-skepticism for everyone who\u2019s\n    trying to do something.\n\n34. *The Filter Bubble* by Eli Pariser\n\n35. *[The Psychopath Test](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594485755)* by\n    Jon Ronson\n\n    Another fun puff pastry of a book.\n\n36. *[Empire State](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0078XPQPG)* by Jason\n    Shiga\n\n    Reads a bit like Shiga trying to do his own version of\n    *[Shortcomings](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1897299753)*. Not a bad\n    book, by any means, but it has none of the Jason Shiga magic.\n\n37. ***[Bookhunter](http://books.theinfo.org/go/097427156X)* by Jason\n    Shiga**\n\n    Words won\u2019t do it justice: an action-movie-thriller of a book, a\n    hilarious adrenaline-fueled ride that\u2019s impossible to put down. I\u2019ve\n    never had this much fun with a piece of entertainment. Just sheer\n    delight.\n\n38. *[Meanwhile](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0810984237)* by Jason Shiga\n\n    Not his best, but still entrancing and strange and very, very good.\n\n39. *[He\u2019s Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding\n    Guys](http://books.theinfo.org/go/141690977X)* by Greg Behrendt and\n    Liz Tuccillo\n\n40. *[Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica\n    review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars)*\n    by John Siracusa\n41. ***[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)*\n    by Eliezer Yudkowsky**\n\n    This is a book whose title still makes me laugh and yet it may just\n    turn out to be one of the greatest books ever written. The writing\n    is shockingly good, the plotting is some of the best in all of\n    literature, and the stories are simply pure genius. I fear this book\n    may never get the accolades it deserves, because it\u2019s too hard to\n    look past the silly name and publishing model, but I hope you, dear\n    reader, are wiser than that! A must-read.\n\n    As it says at the beginning, you really need to give it a couple\n    chapters to get started before passing judgment \u2014 the first bunch\n    are quite silly and it doesn\u2019t seem worth sticking with until you\u2019ve\n    gotten past them.\n\n42. *[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our\n    Lives](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416596585)* by Steven Levy\n\n    Levy again does what he does so well: make an alien culture visible\n    and comprehensible. A great guide to Google.\n\n    (Disclosure: Levy once included me in an essay collection he\n    edited.)\n\n43. *[How to Count](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005DPIKPE)* by Steven\n    Frank\n\n    The first volume into what will surely be a wonderful introduction\n    to programming. Certainly the best book on counting that I\u2019ve read.\n\n44. ***[The Inner Game of\n    Tennis](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679778314)* by Timothy\n    Gallwey**\n\n    This book touched me deeply and made me rethink the entire way I\n    approached life; it\u2019s about vastly more than just tennis. I can\u2019t\n    really describe it, but I can recommend [this video with Alan Kay\n    and the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos) that\n    will blow your mind.\n\n45. ***[The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning\n    Organization](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385517254)* by Peter M.\n    Senge**\n\n    This book does not live up to its title \u2014 it has very little\n    practical advice on how to create a learning organization \u2014 but\n    still, it\u2019s an important topic and I don\u2019t know of anything better.\n    It\u2019s full of fascinating stories and provocations that will change\n    how you think about business.\n\n46. *[House of Holes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B007MXCUNS)* by\n    Nicholson Baker\n\n    I\u2019m not normally one for filthy books, but Baker\u2019s writing is so\n    good that he somehow manages to make this one just utterly\n    compelling despite the smut. I started reading and I couldn\u2019t stop,\n    he just draws you into his world of pure insanity.\n\n47. ***[Rick Perry and his\n    Eggheads](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005HE8ED4)* by Sasha\n    Issenberg**\n\n    Sasha Issenberg is a miracle-worker. This book (really an excerpt\n    from his forthcoming book) is so very, very good that it just blows\n    me away. Issenberg tells the tale of everything I\u2019ve been trying to\n    say to everyone in politics, but he does it in a real-life three-act\n    morality play that\u2019s so good it could be a model on how to tell a\n    story.\n\n48. *[Haiti: After the Quake](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586489739)*\n    by Paul Farmer\n\n    Farmer\u2019s gripping personal story of returning to Haiti after the\n    earthquake and seeing the devastation it had left, both physically\n    and politically. It\u2019s a personal narrative, not a work of\n    investigative journalism, but it still provides powerful insight\n    into what happened.\n\n49. *[Confessions of a \u201cRape Cop\u201d\n    Juror](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LQV3CM)* by Patrick Kirkland\n\n    When I first heard that the \u201crape cop\u201d had been acquitted, I took it\n    as yet another instance of a \u201crape culture\u201d in which crimes against\n    women go unpunished. This book persuaded me that we were all wrong.\n    It\u2019s a fascinating real-life story of what it\u2019s like inside a jury\n    room and what it really means to have proof beyond a reasonable\n    doubt.\n\n50. ***[The End of Loser\n    Liberalism](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0615533639)* by Dean Baker**\n\n    Dean Baker knocks it out of the park again \u2014 a must-read for anyone\n    who cares about economic policy.\n\n51. ***[The Lean Startup](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307887898)* by\n    Eric Ries**\n\n    Ries presents a translation of the Toyota Production System to\n    startups \u2014 and it\u2019s so clearly the right way to run a startup that\n    it\u2019s hard to imagine how we got along before it. Unfortunately, the\n    book has become so trendy that I find many people claiming to swear\n    allegiance to it who clearly missed the point entirely. Read it with\n    an open mind and let it challenge you, so you can start to\n    understand how transformative it really is.\n\n52. *The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man* by Michael Chabon,\n    illustrated by Jake Parker\n\n    A short children\u2019s book with absolutely gorgeous illustrations by\n    Parker and a cute little story by Chabon.\n\n53. *[Harry Potter and the Sorceror\u2019s Stone (Book\n    1)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/059035342X)* by J. K. Rowling\n\n54. *[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book\n    2)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439064872)* by J. K. Rowling\n55. *[Republic, Lost](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446576433)* by\n    Lawrence Lessig\n56. *[Flat Earth News](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0099512688)* by Nick\n    Davies\n\n    I\u2019ve read a lot of books of media criticism and they all tend to\n    trod similar ground: sensationalism, political bias, etc., etc. Nick\n    Davies has written what is, in many ways, the same book \u2014 except he\n    write it as an insider, not an outsider. As a result, he explains\n    *how* the media gets to be this way, *why* it is as bad as it is \u2014\n    and he tells lots of delicious insider stories of incredible things\n    he discovered that got cut or buried or distorted beyond all\n    recognition. Davies is now famous for bringing down the Murdoch\n    empire, but if more people read this book, perhaps he will bring\n    down the rest of corrupt journalism as well.\n\n57. *[Steve Jobs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1451648537)* by Walter\n    Isaacson\n\n    [Siracusa is right](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42): they got the\n    wrong guy. The book is compelling and readable, there\u2019s no doubt\n    about that, but it tells a story that\u2019s basically already been told.\n    Isaacson is so clueless and uncurious that pretty much all of his\n    \u201cexclusive interviews\u201d were wasted; there\u2019s no insight in any of\n    this, just weird lapses into authorial judgment.\n\n    Robert Caro has said there\u2019s one more biography he wants to write\n    after he finishes LBJ. I dearly hope that it\u2019s Steve Jobs.\n\n58. *[Anything You Want](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1936719118)* by\n    Derek Sivers\n\n    I constantly find myself loving Derek Sivers\u2019 blog posts, and while\n    they feel eerily insubstantial collected together here, they\u2019re\n    still full of enough insight and good humor to make them well worth\n    reading.\n\n59. ***[CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and\n    Software](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0735611319)* by Charles\n    Petzold**\n\n    A magnificent achievement. Charles Petzold starts with the story of\n    two kids across the street who wish to communicate with each other\n    and, from this simple beginning, builds up an entire computer\n    without ever making it seem like something that should be over your\n    head. I never really felt I understood the computer until I read\n    this book.\n\n60. *[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book\n    3)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439136369)* by J. K. Rowling\n\n61. *[Masscult and Midcult: Essays Against the American\n    Grain](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159017447X)* by Dwight Macdonald\n    (edited by John Summers), with an introduction by Louis Menand\n\n    Dwight Macdonald is one of those delightful cranks that you can\u2019t\n    help but love watching. Summers has collected a magnificent listing\n    of things to watch \u2014 plus included an introduction that\u2019s the\n    incredible Menand at his best.\n\n62. *[The Ghost [Writer]](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000WJSA6A)* by\n    Robert Harris\n\n    It\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that a big part of the appeal of this\n    book is watching Tony Blair get arrested for war crimes, but that\n    doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a first-rate political thriler.\n\n63. ***[What It Takes: The Way to the White\n    House](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679746498)* by Richard Ben\n    Cramer**\n\n    Were this just the story of how George H. W. Bush got elected, it\u2019d\n    be one of the few biographies that belonged in the same league as\n    Robert Caro. But it\u2019s so much more than that: Richard Ben Cramer\n    gives the same treatment to dozens of candidates in the 1988\n    presidential election: Gary Hart, Bob Dole, Joe Biden, Dick\n    Gephardt, and on and on. Even if you didn\u2019t care about politics,\n    this book would be worth reading simply because the writing is so\n    good. But if you do, there\u2019s never been a better exposition of what\n    drives these men who wish to be our leaders and what they have to go\n    through to get there.\n\n64. *[Joan: Forty Years of Life, Loss, and Friendship with Joan\n    Didion](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005YF5RZO)* by Sara Davidson\n\n    It\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that this book is merely the author\n    attempting to cash in on their minor friendship with Joan Didion,\n    but I love Didion so much that I\u2019m just grateful for the stories.\n\n65. [*How a Book is Born: The Making of* The Art of\n    Fielding](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LEWYYU) by Keith Gessen\n\n    Gessen is an incredible writer and here he has the gift of getting\n    to observe, first-hand, a heartwarming tale. A good story and a\n    great introduction to the modern book business.\n\n66. *[I\u2019m Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number\n    59](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0547737394)* by Douglas Edwards\n\n    There were many, many times in this book that I couldn\u2019t help but\n    wonder: How did he get away with writing this? Google apparently\n    approved of the project and had chaperones in all his interviews,\n    but nonetheless the book is just full of revelations and shockers\n    that it\u2019s hard to imagine Google would ever want to see the light of\n    day.\n\n    There are a lot of books written about Google, but this has got to\n    be one of the best. Edwards is uniquely suited to the task: his\n    talents as a writer allow him to craft a compelling read, his\n    insider\u2019s view of the very early days give him a detailed knowledge\n    from which to tell his story, but his total lack of cultural\n    chemistry with the rest of the Googlers allows him to find\n    mysterious all the crazy things which they all take for granted. A\n    fantastic read.\n\n67. *[The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and\n    Practice](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1455523003)* by Christopher\n    Hitchens\n\n    Mother Teresa is a byword for saintliness, but have you ever stopped\n    to ask why? Christopher Hitchens makes a convincing case that she\u2019s\n    something closer to a monster. Everyone I\u2019ve told about this book is\n    shocked by the concept, but it\u2019s a short book with a pretty\n    compelling argument.\n\n68. *The Gated City* by Ryan Avent\n\n69. *[Books I Did Not Read This Year: An\n    Ebook](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2011/12/08/books-i-did-not-read-this-year-an-ebook/)*\n    by Kieran Healy\n\n    Healy is hilarious; this collection of blog posts was a delight.\n\n70. *[The Devil and Sherlock\n    Holmes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307275906)* by David Grann\n\n    Grann is a masterful nonfiction writer; this is a collection of his\n    pieces.\n\n\n", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As8ovKAdyK-hdGJEd3h3eWpjaWhHRndFS3loOW1sTmc&hl=en_US#gid=0", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586488740", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743291263", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/057366286X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805209999", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B004K1F9KG", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-atavist/id408059276?mt=8&ls=1", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142000280", "http://www.rand.org/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD212.html", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0812974999", "http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307588696", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0051BNV4U", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316528579", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316926108", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/039334052X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0787901873", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316074233", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316056863", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586487981", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594485755", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0078XPQPG", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1897299753", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/097427156X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0810984237", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/141690977X", "http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars", "http://hpmor.com/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416596585", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005DPIKPE", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679778314", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385517254", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B007MXCUNS", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005HE8ED4", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586489739", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LQV3CM", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0615533639", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307887898", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/059035342X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439064872", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446576433", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0099512688", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1451648537", "http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1936719118", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0735611319", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439136369", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/159017447X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000WJSA6A", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679746498", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005YF5RZO", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LEWYYU", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0547737394", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1455523003", "http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2011/12/08/books-i-did-not-read-this-year-an-ebook/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307275906"], "time": 1334818800.0, "postid": "books2011", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010#c8", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/delegation", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs"]}, "officelife": {"post_title": "Life at the Office", "tags": [], "post_content": "Life at the Office\n==================\n\nNovember 10, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/officelife)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt started when he stopped going home. The rent in San Francisco was so\nexpensive and the commutes so painful that it just seemed easier not to\nleave. Nobody really noticed at first\u2014the cleaning crew came in around 7\nand just assumed he was staying late, while the other employees just\nassumed he was an early riser. And really, who\u2019s going to complain about\nan employee who puts in too much time at the office? Especially when he\nwasn\u2019t using it to get additional work done.\n\nThen he started wondering if he could eliminate the trip for food too.\nHe found a website that sold nutritionally-balanced diet bars and\nordered a whole tub, which he placed under his desk. All day he\u2019d be\nmunching on one bar or another, no longer feeling hungry around lunch or\ndinner. So he just sat at his desk munching instead. Strangely, this\ndidn\u2019t seem to make him any more productive.\n\nBetween the lack of exercise and nonstop eating, he began growing fat.\nNobody really said anything to him about it. He was rail-thin when he\nstarted so many co-workers were secretly happy to see him put on a few\npounds. But it quickly got out of hand, with rolls of fat oozing between\nthe cracks in his Aeron chair. Still, nobody wants to insult a fat man,\nso he just continued to grow. He never really needed to leave his chair\nanymore, so he didn\u2019t mind it much.\n\nSoon he began\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure how to describe it, I guess he was sort\nof *fusing* with the chair. The rolls of fat would sneak through a crack\nand then continue growing, like vines crawling through a gate. It\nquickly got to the point where he couldn\u2019t even get out of the chair if\nhe wanted too, the fat had locked him in. He could still roll around the\noffice on it but that movement quickly became tiring and as he grew\nfatter the wheels snapped off.\n\nNobody really seemed to mind, though. He had become an office\nfixture\u2014people came to him now. He\u2019d chat with them about their day or\nkeep an eye on things for them. Since he was always there he knew\neverything that went on in the office and people could always rely on\nhim for gossip or signing for their packages.\n\nSoon it seemed like he was part of the office itself, like some sort of\nroboreceptionist you read about in Negroponte novels. Desks began subtly\norganizing themselves around him and employees began treating him as\njust another office fixture. There\u2019s the bathroom and there\u2019s the\nkitchen and there\u2019s, well, you know\u2026\n\nAnd then, one day, they left. Some corporate restructuring or something;\nthey were all being moved to a different building. People packed their\nstuff in boxes, cleaners cleaned one more time, and then suddenly they\nwere all gone.

They ask it casually,\nlike \u201cHow\u2019s work going?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019d you do this weekend?\u201d But it\u2019s not a\ncasual question. It was a huge, incredible, transformative experience.\nThose 30 days felt like six months. My habits changed, my relationships\nchanged, my identity changed, my personality changed \u2014 hell, the\nphysical shape of my body changed dramatically. I went through four\nlegal pads trying to describe what it was like. I\u2019m still not sure I\nreally know.\n\nOne thing is clear, though: my normal life style isn\u2019t healthy. This\ndoesn\u2019t seem like the kind of thing that requires a break to learn. I\nimagine people with unhealthy lifestyles *know* they\u2019re unhealthy. They\ncome home after work and say \u201cI can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d they cry\nrandomly in elevators. But I didn\u2019t know. Life online is practically the\nonly life I know. Sure, I guess things were different when I was very\nyoung \u2014 I remember, after getting my first email account, wishing\nsomeone would email me so I\u2019d have an email to answer (even then I knew\nI\u2019d soon be missing those empty-inbox days) \u2014 but for most of my life,\nthis has been it: a jumble of interruptions and requests and jobs and\npeople, largely carried out alone. It never let up, so I never saw\nanything different. How was I to know there was anything wrong?\n\nBut the last few weeks have made it clear there was \u2014 is. These weeks\nhaven\u2019t felt that different my other weeks online, really \u2014 same jumble\nof work and people and interruptions as always. The usual sense that I\u2019m\nnever really *here*, I\u2019m always worried about the million things around\nthe corner: a todo list that goes for pages, a thousand emails to\nrespond to, hundreds of blog posts to read, twenty open tabs, a dozen IM\nwindows, a text message to answer, a Twitter stream to catch up on. I\nnever used to think about these things as a benefit *or* a distraction \u2014\nI didn\u2019t think about them at all; they were just how life online was.\nThis was the era of multitasking and I was its child. If I felt anything\nabout it, it was pride \u2014 a kind of joy in (mostly) managing to handle a\nthousand different things thrown my way at once. But I never knew what\nlife was like when things *weren\u2019t* constantly being thrown at you.\nUntil it stopped, I never knew how awful it really was.\n\nI am not happy. I used to think of myself as just an unhappy person: a\nmisanthrope, prone to mood swings and eating binges, who spends his days\nmoping around the house in his pajamas, too shy and sad to step outside.\nBut that\u2019s not how I was offline. I loved people \u2014 everyone from the\ncounter clerk to the old friends I bumped into on the street. And I\nloved to go for walks and exercise in the gym and \u2014 even though there\nwas no one around to see me \u2014 groom. Yes, groom: shower and shave and\nput on nice clothes and comb my hair and clean up my nails and so on,\nall things a month ago I would have said went against my very nature,\nthings I never did before *voluntarily*.\n\nBut most of all, I felt not just happy, but firmly happy \u2014 solid, is the\nbest way I can put it. I felt like I was in control of my life instead\nof the other way around, like its challenges just bounced off me as I\nkept doing what I wanted. Normally I feel buffeted by events, a thousand\ntiny distractions nagging at the back of my head at all times. Offline,\nI felt in control of my own destiny. I felt, yes, serene.\n\nWhen I was very young, my parents introduced me to a book called\n*[Flow](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0061339202)*. It argued that people\ngood at their jobs went into a sort of flow state \u2014 they were \u201cin the\nzone\u201d \u2014 where the normal stress of the world faded away and all their\nconcentration was focused on the task at hand. It wasn\u2019t \u201cfun\u201d the way\nice cream or sex is fun \u2014 it didn\u2019t make you smile, just look grimly\ndetermined \u2014 but it was somehow more than that. It was *fulfilling*. And\nthat was even better than a smile.\n\nI go into such states when programming or writing and they are indeed\nfantastic, but also weirdly hollow. When you come out the real world \u2014\nwith its mundane stresses and distractions \u2014 comes crashing back in, and\nthe moment of flow seems like just another temporary escape, an elusive\ndream.

Normal days weren\u2019t painful anymore. I\ndidn\u2019t spend them filled with worry, like before. Offline, I felt solid\nand composed. Online, I feel like my brain wants to run off in a million\ndifferent directions, even when I try to point it forward.\n\nA friend asked me if I knew I was privileged to be able to take such a\nbreak. It seemed a silly question: I feel privileged every day. As I\nwrite, my best friend is broke and homeless, much of the world struggles\njust to stay alive. I feel privileged to own a mattress, let alone take\na break.\n\nI realize everyone\u2019s lives are filled with work and people and\ndistractions \u2014 the situation brewing at the office, the sump pump\nbreaking down at the house, the family member who\u2019s fallen ill. I\nrealize it must seem like the greatest arrogance to think one could\nescape life\u2019s mundane concerns, like asking to live on a cloud, floating\nabove the mere mortals. But it was that arrogance that made me think I\ncould contribute to adult mailing lists when I was still in elementary\nschool, that arrogance that made me think someone might want to read my\nwebsite when I was still just a teen, that arrogance that had me start a\ncompany as a college freshman. That sort of arrogance \u2014 not bragging,\nbut simply inwardly thinking I could do more than was expected of me \u2014\nis the only thing that\u2019s gotten me anywhere in life. I see no reason to\nstop now.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to carve a life away from the world\u2019s\nconstant demands and distractions. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to balance\nall the things I want to do with the pressures and responsibilities they\nbring.

Wow, it\u2019s a great search engine! Wow, they\u2019re not\nsleazy like other companies! Wow, they treat their hackers well! Wow,\nthey *are* hackers!\n\nThe feeling peaked sometime last year when I was almost rolling on the\nfloor hoping to work at Google. And I do mean peaked. Everything I\u2019ve\nheard since then has been downhill, each time I hear about it Google\nseems less cool. I\u2019m not saying the company is imminently doomed or that\nyou should sell your shares, but I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to\nget any cooler.\n\nGoogle is run like a socialist state. Its citizens are treated extremely\nwell. There\u2019s free food, free doctors, free massages, free games, a\nlimited workweek, etc. There are ministries to give projects free\npromotion and support. The government tries to avoid getting too much in\npeople\u2019s lives. And Google is always coming up with more perks to give\naway. (There\u2019s also a strong class hierarchy, with abused temps and\npowerful acquirees.)\n\nThe problem with a system like this is that it\u2019s necessarily a bubble.\nEverybody inside gets treated grandly, but the outside world gets\nnothing. Indeed, because of Google\u2019s notorious secrecy, they barely even\nget to talk to the people inside. A friend who\u2019s a prominent free\nsoftware developer says that every community member who\u2019s joined Google\nhas stopped contributing to public projects. It\u2019s so bad, he says, that\nthey\u2019re thinking of banning Google from buying a booth at their next\nconference. They can\u2019t afford to lose any more developers.\n\nWhich means that Google has to be careful about who they hire, but since\nthey\u2019re growing so fast they need to [hire people as quickly as\npossible](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116156296729900433.html).\nIt\u2019s an impossible bind \u2014 you can hire lots of people or you can hire\nreally good people, but even a company as prominent as Google is going\nto have a hard time doing both.\n\nThe solution, of course, is to pop the bubble. There\u2019s no reason being\npart of Google has to be a binary decision. Google has a wide variety of\nresources and while there are some they can\u2019t really give away to\neveryone (e.g. massages), there are others that should be easy (e.g.\nservers). Unfortunately for them, Google\u2019s mindset is so obviously set\nthat this will never happen. Even a company as woeful as Amazon is\nalready kicking their but in this space, giving away storage space and\ncomputer power, with more in the works.\n\nBut let\u2019s imagine you had the resources to do this right, what would you\ndo? (I feel like I\u2019m giving away a valuable secret here, but since\nnobody listens to me anyway, I doubt it will make any difference.) The\nright thing is to build not a bubble, with it\u2019s binary in-or-out choice,\nbut to build a gradient, with shades of resources you make available as\npeople achieve success.\n\nSo you have this organization dedicated to building cool web apps. The\nfirst thing you do is you start giving away free food in the middle of\nSan Francisco. You have a nice cozy area with tables and bathrooms and\nWi-Fi and anyone interested in starting a web site is encouraged to drop\nby and hang out. There they can eat, chat, hack, get feedback, get\nsuggestions, get help.\n\nThen you give them free hosting. Servers and bandwidth are cheap, good\nprojects are invaluable. But not only will you host their app for free,\nthrowing in servers to scale it as necessary, but you\u2019ll *pay* them for\nthe privilege of hosting. Indeed, you\u2019ll pay them proportionately to the\namount of traffic they get, in exchange for the right to run ads on it\nsomeday.\n\nSo now you\u2019ve got all the bright, smart young things who want to start\ncompanies starting them on your servers, with clear and unambiguous\nincentives: get traffic, get paid. They don\u2019t need to worry about\nimpressing anyone with their idea; anyone can use the hosting. And they\ndon\u2019t need to sell out to investors anymore; as their traffic grows,\nyou\u2019ll already be giving them the cash to grow the business.\n\nMost of these sites, of course, will probably be failures. But who\ncares? Sites that don\u2019t get much traffic don\u2019t use up much in the way of\nresources. Meanwhile, a couple of the sites will actually take off. So\nwhat do you do with those? *Give them more resources.*\n\nPut your promotional team behind them to spread the word about the\nideas. Have your web designers, database jockeys, and JavaScript\nhotshots help them fix up the site. Encourage promising young\nprogrammers interested in helping out with something to write a feature\nor two.\n\nAnd \u2014 this is where the gradient comes in \u2014 as they become more\nsuccessful, you give them more resources. Let them move into the\napartment building above to food/hangout space, so they can get more\nfacetime with fellow successful hackers. Give them free offices to work\nin. Provide free massages and exercise equipment. Have your PR team set\nup interviews with the major media. Integrate their site with your other\nsites. Plus, of course, they\u2019re getting paid more for more traffic the\nwhole time.\n\nSome of the sites will be huge hits, another YouTube or Facebook. The\nfounders will be raking in millions from the traffic. And at some point,\nthey\u2019ll get tired of running the site and they\u2019ll let it go. You\u2019ll be\nthere to take it over, slap some ads on it to recoup the investment, and\ngive it to some new, junior developers to maintain and improve. And the\ncycle continues.\n\n(Bonus for the truly adventurous: run the whole thing as a non-profit\nand have all the applications involved be open source.)\n\nA bubble like Google can hire only so many people and there\u2019s no way of\npicking only the ones which will be successes. But everyone can be part\nof a gradient and the successes simply rise to the top. I know which one\nI\u2019d work for.\n\n*Thanks to Emmett Shear for discussion and suggestions.*\n", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116156296729900433.html"], "time": 1161846000.0, "postid": "googradient", "internal_links": []}, "finij": {"post_title": "On Finishing *Infinite Jest*", "tags": [], "post_content": "On Finishing *Infinite Jest*\n============================\n\nSeptember 16, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/finij)\n\n* * * * *\n\n> **NOTE:** For those who have actually read *Infinite Jest*, you\u2019ll\n> probably get more out of my very spoiler-heavy summary of [what\n> happens just after the end of the\n> book](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ijend).\n\nI don\u2019t remember starting Infinite Jest.

Around page 750, I found a note I couldn\u2019t\nread in a hand I didn\u2019t recognize with a symbol I couldn\u2019t understand.\nBut it was stamped with the address of our German hotel.

I must have had a room, though, right?\n\nThat week in Boston I tried to write a book. Then I got sick. I stopped\nleaving the apartment. I stopped eating. I went a bit bats, I suppose.\nBut it was getting sick that start of it, some kind of bad cold or\nsomething. I remember that.

My roommates and I had moved\nto San Francisco and the place was left empty except for the collecting\ndust. It was a big place, held three people before we left, and I had it\nto myself, to go mad in.\n\nI next remember reading it in my new place in San Francisco, which I got\nlater that year.

You have a\nconcept in your head and you try to get it across. There are lots of\ntools you can use to do this: you can give an example, you can tell the\nstory of how you thought of it, you can draw a picture. But the concept\nis the important thing.\n\nIn journalism, you\u2019re telling a story. Someone did one thing, which led\nto something else, which led to this other thing. Occasionally you pause\nto take a step back and make some larger point: the story might have\nsome moral or illustrate some larger principle or lead you to a\nconclusion. But the important thing is always the story.\n\nOf course, this is how science advances. Something weird happened over\nhere, so we measured it carefully and took detailed notes. (These are\nthe experimentalists.) When you put all these weird things together,\nthey kind of fit a larger pattern. (These are the theorists.) The theory\nthen leads to more experiments and the new experiments lead to more\ntheory. You inch forward, bouncing between experiment and theory,\njournalism and science writing, to a larger understanding of the world.\n\nBut, of course, just as science requires both, the best science writing\nrequires both. This is what makes *This American Life*\u2019s show \u201c[The\nGiant Pool of\nMoney](http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355)\u201d still so\nunsurpassedly brilliant. It took a question everyone wanted to know the\nanswer to \u2014 why did the economy melt down? \u2014 and explained it not by\njust illustrating the concepts, as many science writers did, or just\ntelling stories of the people involved, as journalists did, but by doing\n*both*, moving between the two modes so you could understand not just\nthe theory but how it worked.\n\nIt seems like an obvious idea, especially when you lay it out this way,\nbut I really can\u2019t think of any other good examples. Take three of my\nvery favorite books: Robert Jackall\u2019s *Moral Mazes*, Robert Karen\u2019s\n*Becoming Attached*, and William Foote Whyte\u2019s \\_Street Corner\nSociety\\_^[1](#fn:fn1)^. All are absolutely brilliant, among the best\nexamples of the genre while conveying facts of incredible importance.\nJackall is very cinematic: his book consists of well-chosen scenes and\nall the theory comes in the cuts between them. (As soon as I finished\nreading it, I wanted to turn it into a movie.) But the two \u2014 scenes and\ntheory \u2014 exist in a weird sort of balance. Neither of them (with a few\nexceptions) really take over and drive the work the way both do in \u201cThe\nGiant Pool of Money\u201d but instead they water each other down: the scenes\nare always illustrating a theory and the theory consists largely of\nscenes.\n\nKaren embeds the theory within his story by telling the story of the\ntheory\u2019s development. Because he does this without condescension, it\u2019s\nas good an introduction to the science as can be imagined. It\u2019s a very\nclever technique, and a very powerful one (I certainly wouldn\u2019t change\nit), but it\u2019s a different one and doesn\u2019t have the same power.\n\nWhyte, by contrast, spends his book telling the story of one example.\nFrom it, he draws out all the important theoretical principles\n(basically inventing every major branch of sociology for the next\ncentury) but the theory is always illustrating his one story, just as\nJackall\u2019s scenes are always illustrating his theory.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell probably comes closest to a genuine mixture of the two,\nbut his work is marred by the fact that he kind of makes up all his\nscience. His stories are never illustrating some established scientific\nprinciple or even a new one he has that he wants to stand up to\nscrutiny, but instead his principles are always invented *ad hoc* to\nserve his stories, with the same fidelity a typical *This American Life*\nepisode has to its theme.

In general, it seems larger books\nwritten by magazine writers might, since magazine articles (story,\nstory, moment of reflection) are the building blocks of the form, but\nI\u2019m still having trouble thinking of other examples. *Outliers* is\n*much* better than the other Gladwell books on this front.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

But currently the corporation\u2019s CEO gets to decide who\u2019s on the\ncard! The result is a board hand-picked by the CEO \u2014 and they return the\nfavor by providing CEOs with exorbitant salaries.\n\nThe current financial regulation bill \u2014 in a provision passed by both\nthe House and Senate \u2014 would change that by allowing shareholders with\n5% of the stock to come together and propose additional names for the\nballot. But the White House is trying to gut this proposal at the last\nminute, and they\u2019ve done it in an incredibly sneaky way \u2014 they removed\nthe letter `s` from the end of the word shareholders.\n\nNow instead of shareholders whose stock adds up to 3% coming together,\nyou have to be a single shareholder with 5% of the stock all by\nyourself. And for most big companies, there just isn\u2019t anyone like that.\nTake GE, for example \u2014 its biggest shareholder only owns about 3.4% of\nthe company.\n\nSo by removing a single letter, they managed to make this provision\ncompletely useless.\n\nThe White House is being barraged by major CEOs begging them to keep\nfighting for this provision \u2014 after all, no CEO wants to see their\nlavish salaries cut! As Barney Frank put it, \u201cI think there are some\npeople in the White House who think, \u2018Well, we\u2019re fighting the financial\ninstitutions, but why fight with some of the others, you know, the other\ncorporations?\u2019\u201d Apparently they\u2019re so scared of a fight, they\u2019re willing\nto gut a provision passed by both the House and Senate.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in fighting for real corporate reform, please sign\nour petition to the White House:\n\n> \u201cStop lobbying against shareholder power in corporate decision-making\n> \u2014 and against protections that would finally rein in CEO pay.

There\u2019s supply (workers) and demand (employers).\nAnd the incredible power of market competition pushes the price (wages)\nto where those two meet. Thus massive unemployment is about as likely as\nhuge unsold piles of wheat: if people aren\u2019t buying, it\u2019s just because\nyou\u2019re setting the price too high.\n\nAnd yet, as I write, 17.5% of the country is unemployed. Are they all\njust insisting on being paid too much? Economists are forced into the\nmost ridiculous explanations. Perhaps people just don\u2019t know where the\njobs are, some say. (Maybe the government should run ads for\nCraigslist.) Or maybe it just takes time for all those former\nhouse-builders to learn new jobs. (This despite the fact that\nunemployment is up in all industries.) But they\u2019re typically forced back\nto the fundamental conclusion of the textbook: that people are just\ndemanding to be paid too much. It might be for the most innocent of\nreasons, but facts are facts.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\u2019 great insight was to see that all of this was\nnonsense. The job market is a very special market, because the people\nwho get \u201cbought\u201d are also the people doing all the buying. After all,\nwhy is it that people are hired to farm wheat? It\u2019s because, at the end\nof the day, other people want to buy it. But if lots of people are out\nof a job, they\u2019re doing their best to save money, which means cutting\nback on purchases. And if they cut back on purchases, that means there\nare fewer people for business to sell to, which means businesses cut\nback on jobs.\n\nClearly something is badly wrong with the basic economic theory. So\nlet\u2019s go through [Keynes\u2019 masterpiece, *The General Theory of\nEmployment, Interest, and\nMoney*](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/generaltheory), and understand his\ntheory of how the economy works.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen you get your paycheck at the end of the week, you spend it. But\npresumably you don\u2019t spend all of it \u2014 you put some money away to save,\nlike you were told as a child. Saving is seen as a great national virtue\n\u2014 thus all those Public Service Announcements with talking piggy banks.\nEveryone knows why: put some money away today and it\u2019ll be worth more\ntomorrow.\n\nBut there\u2019s a kind of illusion involved in this. Money isn\u2019t worth\nanything on its own, it\u2019s only useful because it can buy things. And it\nbuys things because it pays other people to make them for you. But you\ncan\u2019t save *people* in your bank account \u2014 if fifteen million people are\nout of work, they can\u2019t put their time in a piggy bank for when things\nare looking up. The work they could have done is lost forever.\n\nSo yes, some people can save while others borrow from them \u2014 you can let\nyour neighbor buy two iPods in exchange for letting you buy four next\nyear \u2014 but the country, as a whole, cannot. At the end of the day,\nsomeone has to buy the things we can make. But if everyone\u2019s saving,\nthat means people aren\u2019t buying. Which means the people making stuff are\nout of a job.\n\nIt\u2019s a vicious cycle: if people buy less, companies make less, which\nmeans people get paid less, which means people buy less. And so on,\nuntil we\u2019re all out of work. (Thankfully it doesn\u2019t get that bad \u2014 but\nonly because some people are refusing to lower their wages. The thing\nthat mainstream economists said was causing unemployment is actually\npreventing it!)\n\nBut this cycle can be run in reverse. Imagine Donald Trump hires\nunemployed people to build him a new skyscraper. They\u2019re suddenly\ngetting paid again, which means they can start spending again. And each\ndollar they spend goes to a different business, which can start hiring\npeople itself. And then *those* newly-hired people start spending the\nnew money *they* make, and so on. This is the *multiplier*: each dollar\nthat gets spent provides even more than one dollar\u2019s worth of boost to\nthe economy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNow let\u2019s look at things from the employer\u2019s side \u2014 say you run an truck\nfactory. How do you decide how many trucks to make? Obviously, you make\nas many as you think you can profitably sell. But there\u2019s no way to\ncalculate something like that \u2014 it\u2019s a question about what customers\nwill do in the future. There\u2019s literally no way to know. And yet,\nobviously, trucks get made.\n\nIt used to be, Keynes says, that wealthy men just thought investing was\nthe manly thing to do. They weren\u2019t going to sit around and calculate\nwhat kind of bonds yielded the greatest expected return. Bonds are for\nwusses. They were real men. They were going to take their money and\nbuild a railroad.\n\nBut they don\u2019t make rich people like that anymore. Nowadays, they put\ntheir money in the stock market. Instead of boldly picking one great\nenterprise to invest in, they shift their money around from week to week\n(or hire someone else to do it for them). So these days, it\u2019s the stock\nmarket that stimulates most new investment.\n\nBut how does the stock market figure out what profits are supposed to\nbe? In truth, it has no more clue than you do. It\u2019s really just based\naround a convention. We all pretend that whatever the stock price is now\nis a pretty decent guess and then we only have to worry about the\nvarious factors that will cause the stock price to change. We forget\nabout the most basic fact: that nobody has any clue what the stock price\nshould be to begin with.\n\nSo instead of people trying their best to figure out which businesses\nwill make money in the future, and investing in those, we have people\nwho try to figure out which stock prices will change in the future, and\ntrying to get there first. It\u2019s like a giant game of musical chairs \u2014\neverybody\u2019s rushing not to be the one left standing when the music\nstops.\n\nOr, you could say, it\u2019s like those newspaper competitions where you have\nto pick the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs. The prize\ngoes to the person who picks the faces that are most picked, so you\ndon\u2019t pick the faces *you* find prettiest, but instead the faces you\nthink *everyone else* will find prettiest. But it\u2019s not even that, since\neveryone else is doing the same thing \u2014 you\u2019re actually picking the\nfaces you think everyone else will think everyone else will find\nprettiest! And no doubt there are some people who take this even\nfurther.\n\nYou might think this means that someone who actually did the work and\ntried to calculate expected profits would clean up, taking money from\nall the people playing musical chairs. But it\u2019s not so simple.\nCalculating expected profits is really quite hard. To make money, you\u2019d\nhave to be unusually good at it, and it seems much easier to just guess\nwhat everyone else will do.\n\nAnd even if you were somehow good at guessing long-term profits, where\nwould you get the money to invest? It\u2019s in the fundamental nature of\nyour strategy that your investments seem crazy to everyone else. If\nyou\u2019re successful, they\u2019ll write it off as a lucky fluke. And when your\nstocks aren\u2019t doing well (which is most of the time \u2014 they\u2019re long-term\npicks, remember), people will take this as evidence of your failures and\npull their money out.\n\nThe scary thing is that the more open our markets get, the faster people\ncan move their money around and the more trading is based on this kind\nof speculation instead of serious analysis. And that\u2019s scary because \u2014\nrecall \u2014 the whole point of the stock market is to decide the crucial\nquestion of what we, as a society, should build for the future. As\nKeynes says, \u201cWhen the capital development of a country becomes a\nby-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be\nill-done.\u201d\n\nThe best solution is probably a small tax on each trade. Not only would\nthis raise a ton of money (modern estimates suggest even a tiny tax\ncould raise \\$100 billion a year), it would help redirect all the brains\non Wall Street from these wasteful games of musical chairs to something\nactually useful.\n\nBut even if we solve the problem of the stock market, there\u2019s still some\nirreducible uncertainty. Because whether new investment makes sense\nalways depends on whether the economy will be doing well in the future.\nAnd whether the economy is doing well depends on whether there\u2019s new\ninvestment. So, at the end of the day, investment doesn\u2019t depend simply\non a careful calculation of future expected yield, but on our \u201canimal\nspirits,\u201d our optimism about the future. It\u2019s this factor that\nexaggerates booms and deepens slumps and makes it hard to get out of a\nbad situation.\n\nEven more perversely, it means economic performance depends in no small\npart on keeping businessmen happy. If electing Obama gets businessmen\ndepressed, they might pull back their investments and send the economy\ninto a slump. It doesn\u2019t even have to be intentional \u2014 they may very\nwell believe that a President Obama is bad for the economy. But when you\nhave a system that only works when businesspeople feel good, their fears\nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe result, Keynes suggests, is that the government will have to step in\nto prevent the economy from crashing every time rich people get a bit of\nindigestion.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo that\u2019s how we calculate the income side of things, now what about\ncosts? Most costs are pretty clear \u2014 you need to buy equipment and hire\npeople. But since you need to make stuff now that you can only sell in\nthe future, one of your big costs is going to be money to use in the\nmeantime. And the cost of money is just the interest rate. (If you get a\nloan for a million dollars at 5% interest, you\u2019re essentially paying\n\\$50,000 for the right to use the money now.)\n\nThus lowering interest rates increases investment \u2014 it reduces the cost\nof getting money, which reduces the cost of making stuff, which means\nmore things can make a profit. And if more things can make a profit,\nmore things get made, which means more people get hired. So what\ndetermines the interest rate?\n\nWell, if the interest rate is the cost of money, the obvious answer is\nthe amount of money in circulation. If there\u2019s a lot of money lying\naround, you can get some pretty cheap. Which means that, fundamentally,\nunemployment is caused by a lack of money: more money (assuming people\ndon\u2019t hoard it all) means lower interest rates, lower interest rates\n(assuming expected profits don\u2019t crash) means higher investment, higher\ninvestment (assuming people don\u2019t stop buying) means more employment,\nand more employment means higher prices, which means we\u2019re going to need\nmore money.\n\nMoney is created by the central bank (the Federal Reserve in the US),\nwhich decides what they want the interest rate to be and then prints new\nmoney (which they use to buy up government debt) until the interest rate\nis where they want. To get the economy back on track, all they have to\ndo is keep lowering interest rates until investment picks up again and\neveryone has a job.\n\nBut there\u2019s one catch: the interest rate can\u2019t go below zero. (Keynes\ndidn\u2019t think this problem was very likely, but in the US we\u2019re facing it\nright now.) What do you do if the interest rate is zero and people are\nstill out of work?\n\nWell, you can pray that billionaires will start hiring us all to build\nthem giant mansions, but that\u2019s no way to run a country. The government\nhas to step in. Instead of waiting for billionaires to build\npleasure-domes, the government can hire people to build things we all\nneed \u2014 roads, schools, houses, high-speed Internet connections.\nAlthough, honesty, it doesn\u2019t have to be things we all need. They could\nhire people to do anything. This is why inspecting the stimulus money\nfor waste is so ridiculous \u2014 waste is perfectly fine, the important\nthing is to get the money into circulation so that the economy can get\nback on track.\n\nAnother good solution is redistributing income. Poor people are a lot\nmore likely to spend money than billionaires. If we take some money from\nthe billionaires and give it to the poor, the poor will use it to buy\nthings they need and people will get jobs making those things.\n\nRemember that money is just a kind of illusion. In reality, there are\njust people who want things and people who make things. But we\u2019re stuck\nin a completely ridiculous situation: there are lots of people who\ndesperately want jobs making things \u2014 they\u2019re literally not doing\nanything else \u2014 while at the same time there are lots of people who\ndesperately want things made. It seems ridiculous not to do something\nabout this just because some people have all the little green sheets of\npaper!\n\nCapitalism seems to go through frustrating cycles of booms and busts.\nSome people say the solution is just to prevent the booms \u2014 raise\ninterest rates so the party doesn\u2019t get out of hand and we won\u2019t all be\nsorry the next morning. Keynes disagrees: the remedy \u201cis not to be found\nin abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but\nin abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.\u201d\n\nThink back to the dot-com era, when venture capitalists were spending\nall their money laying fiber-optic cable under the street. The right\nsolution wasn\u2019t for the Fed to raise interest rates until even\npunch-drunk venture capitalists could realize all this investment in\nfiber wouldn\u2019t be profitable. The right solution was to *take their\nmoney away*. Give it to the poor, who will spend it on something useful,\nlike food and clothing.\n\nSo those are Keynes\u2019 prescriptions for a successful economy: low\ninterest rates, government investment, and redistribution to the poor.\nAnd, for a time \u2014 from around the 1940s to the 1970s \u2014 that\u2019s kind of\nwhat we did. The results were magical: the economy grew strongly,\ninequality fell away, everyone had jobs.\n\nBut, starting in the 1970s, the rich staged a counterattack. They didn\u2019t\nlike watching inequality \u2014 and their wealth \u2014 melt away. There was a\nresurgence in classical economics, Keynes was declared to have been\ndebunked, and interest rates were raised drastically, throwing millions\nout of work. The economy tanked, inequality soared, and things have\nnever been the same since. For a while people talked about levels of\ninequality that hadn\u2019t been seen since the 1920s. Then they talked about\na recession the size of which hadn\u2019t been seen since the 1930s.\n\nOnce again, Keynes provides us with the instructions on how to get out\nof this mess. The question is whether we\u2019ll follow them.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1253775600.0, "postid": "keynes", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/generaltheory"]}, "miraclediet": {"post_title": "The Miracle Diet", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Miracle Diet\n================\n\nApril 26, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/miraclediet)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![](image1_miraclediet)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0399153640)\n\nYou eat food that has calories. And you do things that burn calories.\nThe calories left over get stored as fat. And thus, the typical advice\nfor losing weight: eat less, exercise more. Fewer calories are eaten and\nmore are burned and so the result is less fat. There\u2019s just one problem:\nthat\u2019s really hard. To burn enough calories to lose a lot of weight, you\nreally have to put an awful lot of time into it. And if you try to eat\nless, your body just feels hungry all the time, because it wants more.\n\nSo what if instead of forcing your body to eat less, you teach your body\nto *want* less. After all, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s obesity, not lack of\nfat, that\u2019s the health problem. So getting your body to want less food\nwould be a good thing. And it would make dieting incredibly easy too \u2014\ninstead of fighting to count calories or avoid eating certain foods, you\ndo nothing at all; you\u2019re just not interested in eating.\n\nIt sounds like a pipe dream, but Seth Roberts argues that it\u2019s possible.\nDrawing on the results of a number of studies with rats, his own\nexperiments on himself, and the best research on nutrition and weight\nloss, he\u2019s developed a theory of how the body decides what it feels like\neating.\n\nOur body\u2019s weight, he says, is regulated by a \u201cset point\u201d, like the\nsetting on a thermostat. If our weight is lower than our internal set\npoint, we feel hungry; higher, we feel full. So if you want to weigh\nless, all you need to do is lower your body\u2019s set point. Your body will\nstop being hungry, you\u2019ll burn the fat you already have, and your weight\nwill go down.\n\nBut how would you do that? Roberts argues that a person\u2019s set point\nisn\u2019t fixed, instead it goes up and down based on what they eat. After\nall, the whole reason the body stores up calories when food is abundant\nis so it can use them in \u201clean years\u201d, when food is scarce. So it would\nmake sense for a person\u2019s set point to go up when food is abundant\n(allowing them to build up fat) and down when it\u2019s scarce (so they don\u2019t\nfeel hungry all the time).\n\nThe problem, of course, is that food is never scarce anymore. You can\nalways just go to McDonald\u2019s. The body is storing up for an eventuality\nthat will never come. So how do you get it to stop? Maybe you could\ntrick it into thinking food was scarce.\n\nThis is where Roberts\u2019s big insight comes \u2014 he argues that we use a\nPavlovian sort of flavor-conditioning system to see whether food is\nscarce. If we eat foods frequently, we grow to like their taste, and\nthus our brain realizes we\u2019re eating them out of choice and raises the\nset point. On the other hand, if we eat new foods or foods with little\ntaste, our brain assumes we\u2019re eating them because there\u2019s nothing else\naround and the set point is lowered.\n\nAnd thus, the way to lower your set point: eat foods with no taste. Of\ncourse, they have to have calories as well, so Roberts\u2019s preferred\nsuggestion is extra-light olive oil (ELOO), which is basically just oil\nwith absolutely no taste. Your body gets the calories but it doesn\u2019t get\nthe taste, so the set point goes lower every time you eat it.\n\nIt all seems crazy, but Roberts is sort of a crazy guy, so he decided to\ntest it. He started taking a couple hundred tasteless calories every\nday. Almost immediately, he begun feeling less hungry. He started eating\none meal every other day, even while still exercising, and felt great.\nHe lost a pound of weight a week with no effort. He lost so much weight\nthat his friends started telling him that he looked too thin, so he\nstarted taking less tasteless calories and put some weight back on. It\nwas amazing; a diet plan unlike any other.\n\nHe told friends about it and it worked for them too. It was written up\nin *The New York Times* and readers wrote in with letters saying it was\nworking for them. Blogs started to keep track of people\u2019s stories \u2014\nalmost all successful. And now he has a new book yesterday, *The\nShangri-La Diet*, which explains how you can do it to.\n\nThe book is odd, in that it looks pretty much like any other silly diet\nbook, but the contents are rather different. Although clearly rushed,\nthe book has an appendix of scientific studies using rats to back up its\narguments about theory and happily features the stories of people who\ntried the diet and found it didn\u2019t work along with those who tried the\ndiet and found it did.\n\nObviously, such anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t enough to prove the system\nworks, but it does make it intriguing enough to try. I\u2019ve started taking\na couple tablespoons of extra light olive oil and already I found myself\nskipping a meal, something I\u2019ve never been able to do before. We\u2019ll see\nhow it goes.\n\n-   [Buy the book from Amazon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0399153640)\n\n\n[image1_miraclediet]: image1_miraclediet.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0399153640", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0399153640"], "time": 1146034800.0, "postid": "miraclediet", "internal_links": []}, "webproductivity": {"post_title": "Some Announcements", "tags": [], "post_content": "Some Announcements\n==================\n\nJanuary 5, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/webproductivity)\n\n* * * * *\n\nMy new Python web application library, [web.py](http://webpy.org/), is\nout.\n\n[An essay of mine about\nproductivity](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity) has made the\nrounds.

You see this all over the place \u2014 it\u2019s how\nscience works, it\u2019s how you program, it\u2019s even how people deal with\ntheir friends (\u201clet\u2019s do the mall again\u201d).\n\nSo it would seem natural to think that smart people would work on a very\nhigh level, dealing not in details but in huge abstractions. They would\nhave turned everything into a component, no longer worrying about its\ndetails, and built things out of the results.\n\nBizarrely, this seems entirely untrue. The smartest people I know\ndisdain abstractions, preferring to speak in concrete specifics. Take\nPaul Buchheit, the genius behind Gmail. When he talks about building web\napplications, he doesn\u2019t think about high-level things like the\nunderlying semantic structure of the data \u2014 instead he talks about the\nlittle \u201cheads\u201d that read data off of the hard disk and how fast they can\nmove.\n\nAnother friend, also incredibly bright, doesn\u2019t refer to other people\nthat way. He doesn\u2019t say \u201coh, he\u2019s an expert in X\u201d or \u201che\u2019s really smart\nabout X\u201d; instead he says \u201che\u2019s thought a lot about X\u201d \u2014 breaking down\nthe abstractions of expertise and intelligence into something much more\nconcrete: spending time thinking about something.\n\nAt first glance these seem like mistakes. Why should a brilliant web app\nprogrammer be thinking about hard disk heads? Isn\u2019t that something\nsomeone else should take care of? And why is my smart friend only\nconcerned with how much time someone has spent on something? Aren\u2019t\nthere other factors involved?\n\nBut if you look the other direction, you see the same pattern. Clueless\nbusiness guys love speaking in big abstractions, talking about\n\u201cinformation superhighways\u201d that act as \u201cmore efficient content delivery\nsystems\u201d that will \u201cmonetize the genre\u201d by \u201cdisintermediating the legacy\nplayers\u201d. These guys are speaking exactly as you would expect smart\npeople to \u2014 thinking at a high level, working with the big ideas \u2014 yet\nthe things they say are so incredibly stupid that they either don\u2019t mean\nanything or mean something that\u2019s actually impossible.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? As we noted at the beginning, the brain works\nby mastering the details and *then* giving them a name. But the business\nguys took the easy way out: they just mastered the names. If you asked\nthem exactly how a content delivery system worked, they wouldn\u2019t be able\nto tell you. They know only the high-level thing, with none of the\ndetails.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the details that make it so interesting \u2014 and so powerful.\nAnyone can master the names of big concepts and combine them like so\nmany puzzle pieces; it\u2019s knowing how they work that takes time. And the\nsmart people have made that investment. So perhaps it\u2019s just natural\nthat they want to stay it a little closer to it than most.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1165219200.0, "postid": "smartabstractions", "internal_links": []}, "waitingforsuperman": {"post_title": "The Real Problem with *Waiting for \u201cSuperman\u201d*", "tags": ["movies", "education"], "post_content": "The Real Problem with *Waiting for \u201cSuperman\u201d*\n==============================================\n\nOctober 8, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/waitingforsuperman)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[[crossposted at\nHuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-swartz/the-real-problem-with-wai_b_748748.html)]\n\n*Waiting for \u201cSuperman\u201d*, in case you haven\u2019t heard, is the hot new film\nfrom *Inconvenient Truth* director Davis Guggenheim. While his last film\ncapitalized on liberal guilt over destroying our planet (and maybe\nvoting for Ralph Nader?), *\u201cSuperman\u201d* (yes, the film is weirdly\ninsistent on those unnecessary quotation marks) is for people who feel\nbad about sending their kids to private school while poor kids wallow in\nthe slums.\n\n\u201cTeaching should be easy,\u201d Guggenheim declares as we watch a cartoon\nteacher rip open his students\u2019 skulls and pour what looks like blue\nSpaghetti-O\u2019s inside. (When he closes the skulls the kids sprout wings\nand fly out the open classroom window.) This is about as close as the\nfilm gets to depicting actual teaching. (I checked with the friend who\npaid for my ticket and he confirmed this scene was meant seriously,\nthough thankfully not literally.)\n\nDespite repeatedly insisting poor kids just need better teachers, the\nfilm never says what it is that better teachers actually do. Instead it\nhighlights the voices of American Express pitchman Geoffrey Canada and\nBill Gates, whose obsessions with higher standardized test scores have\nled their schools to cancel recess and art in favor of more hours of\nscripted memorization. Why bother with art if teaching is just about\nfilling kids\u2019 heads with pre-determined facts?\n\nThe real crisis in American education isn\u2019t teachers\u2019 unions preventing\nincompetent teachers from getting fired (as awful as that may be), it\u2019s\nthe single-minded focus on standardized test scores that underlies\neverything from Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind to Obama\u2019s Race to the Top\nto the charter schools lionized in the film. Real education is about\ngenuine understanding and the ability to figure things out on your own;\nnot about making sure every 7th grader has memorized all the facts some\nbureaucrats have put in the 7th grade curriculum.\n\nThis would be obvious if the film dared to show real teaching in the\nschools it lauds. Instead of the rich engagement you imagine from\nprogressive private schools, you find teachers who read from assigned\nscripts while enforcing a regime of zero-tolerance discipline. They\u2019re\nnightmarish gulags where children\u2019s innate creativity is beaten out of\nthem and replaced with martial order. Because standardized behavior is\nwhat makes you do well on standardized tests.\n\nFilm is the perfect medium for showing what this life is like. Seeing\nterrified kids up on the big screen, you can\u2019t help but empathize with\nthem. So we never see it. Instead, the film hides behind charts and\ngraphs and interviews. \u201cWhen you see a great teacher, you are seeing a\nwork of art,\u201d Geoffrey Canada tells us, but this is something Guggenheim\nwould rather tell than show.\n\nThe film has other flaws. It insists all of America\u2019s problems would be\nsolved if only poor kids would memorize more: Pittsburgh is falling\napart not because of deindustrialization, but because its schools are\nfilled with bad teachers. American inequality isn\u2019t caused by decades of\nReaganite tax cuts and deregulation, but because of too many failing\nschools. Our trade deficit isn\u2019t a result of structural economic factors\nbut simply because Chinese kids get a better education. Make no mistake,\nI desperately want every kid to go to a school they love, but it seems\nfar-fetched to claim this would solve all our country\u2019s other problems.\nAt the end of the day, we have an economy that works for the rich by\ncheating the poor and unequal schools are the result of that, not the\ncause.\n\nI\u2019m glad a talented filmmaker has decided to draw attention to the\nhorrible inequities in our nation\u2019s schools. But I\u2019m terrified that the\nsolutions put forth by its proponents will only make things worse. We\nknow what happens when we fire teachers who don\u2019t do enough to raise\ntheir students\u2019 test scores, or when we adopt more stringent\nrequirements for classroom curriculum: we squeeze out what little\ngenuine education these schools have left. And that\u2019s something we\nshould really feel guilty about.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-swartz/the-real-problem-with-wai_b_748748.html"], "time": 1286521200.0, "postid": "waitingforsuperman", "internal_links": []}, "transparencybunk": {"post_title": "Transparency is Bunk", "tags": [], "post_content": "Transparency is Bunk\n====================\n\nApril 23, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/transparencybunk)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Adapted from an impromptu rant I gave to some people interested in\nfunding government transparency projects.*\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past year and change working on a site, watchdog.net,\nthat publishes government information online. In doing that, I\u2019ve\nlearned a lot: I\u2019ve looked at everything from pollution records to voter\nregistration databases and I\u2019ve figured out a number of bureacratic\ntricks to get information out of the government. But I\u2019ve also become\nincreasingly skeptical of the transparency project in general, at least\nas it\u2019s carried out in the US.\n\nThe way a typical US transparency project works is pretty simple. You\nfind a government database, work hard to get or parse a copy, and then\nput it online with some nice visualizations.\n\nThe problem is that reality doesn\u2019t live in the databases. Instead, the\ndatabases that are made available, even if grudgingly, form a kind of\nofficial cover story, a veil of lies over the real workings of\ngovernment. If you visit a site like GovTrack, which publishes\ninformation on what Congresspeople are up to, you find that all of\nCongress\u2019s votes are on inane items like declaring holidays and naming\npost offices. The real action is buried in obscure subchapters of\ninnocuous-sounding bills and voted on under emergency provisions that\nlet everything happen without public disclosure.\n\nSo government transparency sites end up having three possible effects.\nThe vast majority of them simply promote these official cover stories,\nmisleading the public about what\u2019s really going on. The unusually\ncutting ones simply make plain the mindnumbing universality of waste and\ncorruption, and thus promote apathy. And on very rare occasions you have\na \u201csuccess\u201d: an extreme case is located through your work, brought to\njustice, and then everyone goes home thinking the problem has been\nsolved, as the real corruption continues on as before.\n\nIn short, the generous impulses behind transparency sites end up doing\nmore harm than good.\n\nBut this is nothing new. The whole [history of the \u201cgood government\u201d\nmovement](http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/local.html) in\nthe US is of \u201creformers\u201d who, intentionally or otherwise, weakened the\ncause of democracy. They too were primarily supported by large\nfoundations, mostly Ford and Rockefeller. They replaced\ndemocratically-elected mayors with professional city managers, which\nrequired a supermajority to overrule. They insisted on nonpartisan\nelections, making it difficult to organize people into political blocs.\nArguing it would reduce corruption, they insisted city politicians serve\nwithout paying, ensuring the jobs were only open to the wealthy.\n\nI worry that transparency groups may be making the same \u201cmistake\u201d.\n\nThese are some dark thoughts, so I want to add a helpful alternative:\njournalism. Investigative journalism lives up to the promise that\ntransparency sites make. Let me give three examples: Silverstein,\nTaibbi, Caro.\n\n[Ken Silverstein](http://www.harpers.org/subjects/KenSilverstein)\nregularly writes brilliant pieces about the influence of money in\npolitics. And he uses these sorts of databases to do so. But the\ndatabases are always a small part of a larger picture, supplemented with\ninterviews, documents, and even undercover investigation \u2014 he recently\ndid a piece where he posted as a representative of the government of\nTurkmenistan and described how he was wined and dined by lobbyists eager\nto build support for that noxious regime. The story, and much more, is\ntold in his book\n*[Turkmeniscam](http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X)*. (His book\n*[Washington Babylon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1859840922)* is\nsimilarly indispensible.)\n\nMatt Taibbi, in his book *[The Great\nDerangement](http://books.theinfo.org/go/038552062X)*, describes how\nCongress really works. He goes to the capitol and lays out the whole\nscene: the Congressmen naming post offices on the House floor, the\njournalists typing in the press releases they\u2019re handed, the key actions\ngoing on behind the scenes and out of the public eye, the continual use\nof emergency procedures to evade disclosure laws.\n\nAnd Robert Caro, in his incredible book *[The Power\nBroker](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245)* (one of the very best\nbooks ever published, I\u2019m convinced) takes on this fundamental political\nquestion of \u201cWho\u2019s actually responsible for what my government is\ndoing?\u201d For forty years, everyone in New York thought they knew the\nanswer: power was held by the city council, the mayor, the state\nlegislature, and the governor. After all, they run the government,\nright?\n\nAnd for forty years, they were all wrong. Power was held \u2014 held, for the\nmost part, *absolutely*, without any checks or outside influence \u2014 by\none man: Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. All that time, everyone\n(especially the press) treated Robert Moses as merely the Parks\nCommissioner, a mere public servant serving his elected officials. In\nreality, he pulled the strings of all those elected officials.\n\nThese journalists tackled all the major questions supposedly addressed\nby US transparency sites \u2014 who\u2019s buying influence? what is Congress\ndoing? who\u2019s in power in my neighborhood? \u2014 and not only tell a richer,\nmore informative story, but come to strikingly different answers to the\nquestions. In this era where investigative reporting budgets have been\ncut to the bone and newspapers are folding left and right, it\u2019s fallen\nto nonprofits like ProPublica and the Center for Independent Media and,\nfrom a previous era, the Center for Public Integrity, to pick up the\nslack. They\u2019ve been using the Internet in innovative ways to supplement\ngood old-fashioned narrative journalism, where transparency sites are a\nsupplement, rather than an end-in-themselves.\n\nFor too long we\u2019ve been funding transparency projects on the model of\nif-we-build-it-they-will-come: that we don\u2019t know what transparency will\nbe useful for, but once it\u2019s done it will lead to all sorts of exciting\npossibilities. Well, we\u2019ve built it. And they haven\u2019t come. The only\nsuccess story its proponents can point to is that transparency projects\nhave bred even more transparency projects. I\u2019m done working on\nwatchdog.net; I\u2019m done hurting America. It\u2019s time to give old-fashioned\nnarrative journalism a try.\n\n*Previously:* [Disinfecting the Sunlight\nFoundation](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dissunlight) [November 2006]\n", "external_links": ["http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/local.html", "http://www.harpers.org/subjects/KenSilverstein", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1859840922", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/038552062X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245"], "time": 1240470000.0, "postid": "transparencybunk", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dissunlight"]}, "followyourheart": {"post_title": "Follow Your Heart", "tags": [], "post_content": "Follow Your Heart\n=================\n\nMay 14, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/followyourheart)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor years, I\u2019ve wanted to be on public radio.

They sleep on couches in\nthe common rooms, break into the showers in the gym, and steal food and\ndrink from the cafeterias. They use the money they save on necessities\nto promote the public good. I suggested that they\u2019re actually behaving\nmore morally than the average citizen. This seems shocking, so let\u2019s\nlook at the objections in depth.\n\nThere\u2019s the obvious argument that by taking these things without paying,\nthey\u2019re actually passing on their costs to the rest of the MIT\ncommunity. But for most of these things, there are no costs: no MIT\nstudents use the couches or the showers at night. And while it\u2019s true\nthat taking MIT food and drink probably does increase the university\u2019s\ncosts slightly, this concern doesn\u2019t seem too consistently applied. Do\nyou think it\u2019s wrong to take one of the free refreshments at an MIT\nevent? The consequences seem about the same.\n\nEven if they were costing MIT money, it seems this could be justified.\nMIT receives enormous sums from the wealthy and powerful, more than they\nknow how to spend. Much of it gets spent on unneeded luxuries for their\nalready-elite students. Redistributing it to the town\u2019s poorer residents\nseems potentially justified.\n\nOthers claim that this lifestyle results in increased security costs. I\ndon\u2019t see how that\u2019s true unless the students get caught. Even if they\ndid, MIT has a notoriously relaxed security policy, so they likely\nwouldn\u2019t get in too much trouble and MIT probably wouldn\u2019t do anything\nto up their security.\n\nA more serious complaint is that this \u201cerodes the social contact.\u201d Peter\nSinger (no contract theorist he!) puts this more clearly in his book\n*Democracy and Disobedience*: In any society people are going to have\ndisputes. Everyone\u2019s better off if these disputes are resolved without\nresorting to force. Thus in most societies there are governments to help\nresolve disputes peacefully. Resorting to force when you don\u2019t like\ntheir resolution could tip things back to the bad state of people\nresolving things through force in general.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a particularly plausible concern. My friends\n(understandably) keep quiet about their lifestyle. If anyone, *I* am the\none undermining the social contract by publicizing it. But let\u2019s keep me\nout of this analysis for a second. It\u2019s hard to see how sleeping on MIT\ncouches will lead to violent revolution.^[1](#fn:d)^\n\nIt\u2019s possible there are other objections to this style of life. Or\nperhaps some objectors are right \u2014 and not only shouldn\u2019t we steal from\nMIT, but we shouldn\u2019t take advantage of their largesse either. But\nthinking about these questions \u2014 as opposed to blindly following rules \u2014\nis what it means to be a moral person and instead of eroding the social\ncontract it seems much more likely to strengthen our moral sense.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Singer identifies one other concern, particular to democracies. (He\n    thinks the previous concern is especially relevant in democracies,\n    since there\u2019s not much improvement revolution can lead to, but in\n    the end he decides this isn\u2019t too relevant since modern\n    \u201cdemocracies\u201d aren\u2019t actually democratic.) He suggests that it\u2019s\n    wrong to participate in politics and vote like everybody else, but\n    then refuse to follow the rules when the decision ends up being\n    something you don\u2019t like.\n\n    I think this is a fairly silly objection and basically impossible to\n    justify on utilitarian grounds. (The book is Singer\u2019s doctoral\n    thesis and is weirdly agnostic on utilitarianism. It\u2019s also not\n    particularly well-written, so my apologies if I\u2019m missing part of\n    Singer\u2019s argument.)\n\n    Imagine it\u2019s a presidential election year and the major issue is\n    that candidate A has promised to make kids in public schools wear\n    uniforms while candidate B opposes it. (Imagine also that the\n    president has the power to accomplish this rule change by simple\n    executive order.) Whatever happens, you refuse to send your child to\n    school wearing a uniform \u2014 you plan to keep dressing them as you do\n    now. You have two choices: vote for candidate B or not cast a vote\n    for president.\n\n    Singer suggests that if you vote for B and A wins, you ought to make\n    your child wear the uniform. It\u2019s hard to see how this helps anyone.\n    Nobody knows whether you voted for president or not (it\u2019s a secret\n    ballot), no good (as far as I can see) comes from not voting.\n    Indeed, if you vote for B, you make it more likely that everyone\n    avoids this unjust law *and* you make it more likely you won\u2019t have\n    to resort to civil disobedience and erode the social fabric.\n\n    It\u2019s hard to see how any intuitive notion of obligation can trump\n    this.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:d)\n\n\n", "external_links": ["#fn:d", "#fnref:d"], "time": 1252998000.0, "postid": "honesttheft", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ethics"]}, "awfullectures": {"post_title": "The Awfulness of College Lectures", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Awfulness of College Lectures\n=================================\n\nOctober 3, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/awfullectures)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*What do the children of privilege do when not engaging in conspicuous\nconsumption while [wearing fashionable\nclothes](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fashionnotes)? Why attend class,\nof course! This bizarre, yet widespread, affectation seemed intriguing\nenough that I decided to pursue a further investigation in my inimitable\n\u201cfirst-person snob\u201d style.*\n\nThe Harvard students sit patiently outside the lecture hall as they wait\nfor the previous class to end. Many simply sit, but others, showing the\ngo-get-it-ness that got them into Harvard, begin attempting conversation\nwith their neighbors. The awkward situation shows through in the awkward\nconversation (which, no doubt, they will learn to smooth over as they\nget older) about superficial topics of schoolwork (never school content,\nof course).\n\nAs the previous class exits, we file in and take our seats. Gabbing\ncontinues somewhat for a while until, all of a sudden, as if by some\nmysterious consensus, it completely silences. The professor seems\nsurprised too. \u201cWell, uh, it got quiet all of a sudden,\u201d he says\nhaltingly, \u201cso I guess I better start talking.\u201d For a professor in\nsocial psychology, you think he\u2019d show a little more interest.\n\nHe begins the lecture in the standard way since PowerPoint: a title\nslide (with a cute illustration), a table of contents slide (which he\nwalks through interminably slowly), and then a series of chunks of text\nand illustrations, which he walks through one by one. It\u2019s so bad it\nmakes we want to tear my hair out. The content is largely superficial;\nthe presentation is unnaturally slow. (We literally spend a good five\nminutes talking about a specific gross-out gag.)\n\nBut while this may be an extreme version of it, at its essence, this is\nthe college lecture. Someone who (we\u2019ll give them the benefit of the\ndoubt) is quite smart appearing stupid for fifty minutes so that they\ncan communicate basic facts to kids \u201cat their level\u201d. Edward Tufte\nteaches us to always ask about the information density of a method of\ncommunication. The information communicated in this lecture could have\nfit on one side of a single piece of paper.\n\nThere was a camera in the back of the hall, presumably recording the\nproceedings. But had this been available online, I doubt I could have\nforced myself to watch it. (The other day someone asked me why more\npeople don\u2019t watch the recordings of MIT lectures made available for\nfree online. This is why.) The only reason the lecture is tolerable at\nall is because there\u2019s something captivating about being in the presence\nof another human being, regardless of what they\u2019re saying. But it\ndoesn\u2019t seem like that communicates anything additional \u2014 whether you\nsee the guy in person or watch him at home, he\u2019s still saying the same\nstuff. And so when you watch him at home, there\u2019s just not much there.\n\nSo if what he\u2019s saying isn\u2019t very interesting, why do we subject\nourselves to it? How did this become the primary method of education?\nWhy do kids paid tens of thousands of dollars, in large part to fly\nsomeplace else to see someone say something they would have been bored\nto watch at home?\n\nBack at Harvard, as I walk out of the class I hear the students gabbing.\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m so glad I took this class,\u201d one says. \u201cThat was the best\nlecture I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1159858800.0, "postid": "awfullectures", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fashionnotes"]}, "immoral": {"post_title": "Life in a World of Pervasive Immorality: The Ethics of Being Alive", "tags": [], "post_content": "Life in a World of Pervasive Immorality: The Ethics of Being Alive\n==================================================================\n\nAugust 2, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/immoral)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI used to think I was a pretty good person. I certainly didn\u2019t kill\npeople, for example. But then Peter Singer pointed out that animals were\nconscious and that eating them led them to be killed and that wasn\u2019t all\nthat morally different from killing people after all. So I became a\nvegetarian.\n\nAgain I thought I was a pretty good person. But then Arianna Huffington\ntold me that by driving in a car I was pouring toxic fumes into the air\nand sending money to foreign dictatorships. So I got a bike instead.\n\nBut then I realized that my bike seat was sewn by children in foreign\nsweatshops while its tubing was made by mining metals through ripping up\nthe earth. Indeed, any money I spent was likely to go to oppressing\npeople or destroying the planet in one way or another. And if I happen\nto make money some of it goes to the government which spends it blowing\npeople up in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nI thought about just living off of stuff I found in dumpsters, like some\nfriends. That way I wouldn\u2019t be responsible for encouraging its\nproduction. But then I realized that some people buy the things they\ncan\u2019t find in dumpsters; if I got to the dumpster and took something\nbefore they did, they might buy it instead.\n\nThe solution seemed clear: I\u2019d have to go off-the-grid and live in a\ncave, gathering nuts and berries. I\u2019d still probably be exhaling CO2 and\nusing some of the products in the Earth, but probably only in levels\nthat were sustainable.\n\nPerhaps you disagree with me that it\u2019s morally wrong to kill animals or\nblow up people in Afghanistan. But surely you can imagine that it\n*might* be, or at least that someone could think it is. And I think it\u2019s\nsimilarly clear that eating a hamburger or paying taxes contributes \u2014 in\na very small way; perhaps only has the possibility of contributing \u2014 to\nthose things.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t, everyday life has a million ways that are more\ndirect. Personally, I think it\u2019s wrong that I get to sit at a table and\ngaily devour while someone else delivers more food to my table and a\nthird person slaves over a stove. Every time I order food, I make them\ndo more carrying and slaving. (Perhaps they get some money in return,\nbut surely they\u2019d prefer it if I just gave them the money.) Again, you\nmay not think this wrong but I hope you can admit the possibility. And\nit\u2019s obviously my fault.\n\nOff in the cave, I thought I was safe. But then I read [Peter Singer\u2019s\nlatest book](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/). He points out that for\nas little as a quarter, you can save a child\u2019s life. (E.g. for 27 cents\nyou can buy the oral rehydration salts that will save a child from fatal\ndiarrhea.) Perhaps I was killing people after all.\n\nI couldn\u2019t morally make money, for the reasons described above.\n(Although maybe it\u2019s worth helping fund the bombing of children in\nAfghanistan in order to help save children in Mozambique.) But instead\nof living in a cave, I could go to Africa and volunteer my time.\n\nOf course, if I do that there are a thousand other things I\u2019m not doing.\nHow can I decide which action I take will save the most lives? Even if I\ntake the time to figuring out, that\u2019s time I\u2019m spending on myself\ninstead of saving lives.\n\nIt seems impossible to be moral. Not only does everything I do cause\ngreat harm, but so does everything I don\u2019t do. Standard accounts of\nmorality assume that it\u2019s difficult, but attainable: don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t\ncheat, don\u2019t steal. But it seems like living a moral life isn\u2019t even\npossible.\n\nBut if morality is unattainable, surely I should simply do the best I\ncan. (Ought implies can, after all.) Peter Singer is a good utilitarian,\nso perhaps I should try to maximize the good I do for the world. But\neven this seems like an incredibly onerous standard. I should not just\nstop eating meat, but animal products altogether. I shouldn\u2019t just stop\nbuying factory-farmed food, I should stop buying altogether. I should\ntake things out of dumpsters other people are unlikely to be searching.\nI should live someplace where others won\u2019t be disturbed.\n\nOf course all this worrying and stress is preventing me from doing any\ngood in the world. I can hardly take a step without thinking about who\nit hurts. So I decide not to worry about the bad I might be doing and\njust focus on doing good \u2014 screw the rules.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t just apply to the rules inspired by Peter Singer.\nWaiting in line at the checkout counter is keeping me from my\nlife-saving work (and paying will cost me life-saving money) \u2014 better\njust to shoplift. Lying, cheating, any crime can be similarly justified.\n\nIt seems paradoxical: in my quest to do good I\u2019ve justified doing all\nsorts of bad. Nobody questioned me when I went out and ordered a juicy\nsteak, but when I shoplift soda everyone recoils. Is there sense in\nfollowing their rules or are they just another example of the world\u2019s\npervasive immorality?

Ive and Jobs became close friends and collaborators,\nbut Ive, \u201cso instinctively nice,\u201d found himself puzzled about how his\ngood friend could be so mean:\n\n> He\u2019s a very, very sensitive guy. That\u2019s one of the things that makes\n> his antisocial behavior, his rudeness, so unconscionable.

[\u2026And] because of how very sensitive he is,\n> he knows exactly how to efficiently and effectively hurt someone. And\n> he does do that. (462)\n\nSteve\u2019s fits are legendary. \u201cHe would shout at a meeting, \u2018You asshole,\nyou never do anything right,\u2019\u201d recalls his director of finance, Debi\nColeman. \u201cIt was like an hourly occurrence.\u201d (124) \u201cThis is shit!\u201d he\nyelled after seeing the first draft of the \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones\u201d\nad. \u201cIt\u2019s advertising agency shit and I hate it.\u201d (329)\n\n> Something was either \u201cthe best thing ever,\u201d or it was shitty,\n> brain-dead, inedible. \u2026Any perceived flaw could set off a rant. The\n> finish on a piece of metal, the curve on the head of a screw, the\n> shade of blue on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen\u2014he\n> would declare them to \u201ccompletely suck\u201d until that moment when he\n> suddenly pronounced them \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d (561)\n\nOne way of reading this is that Steve Jobs is just a sociopath, someone\nwho knows exactly where people\u2019s weaknesses are and plays on them\nmasterfully until they do exactly, precisely what he wants, without\nlittle concern about human consequences.\n\nBut there\u2019s another, more sympathetic reading. I think Jobs really did\nfeel this way. He had such an intense aesthetic sense that even\nsomething as minor as the curve on the head of the screw could cause him\nenormous pain. And, like anyone in pain, he responded by lashing out at\nthe people around him. There are some people who, when they\u2019re insulted,\ncan\u2019t resist punching the person who insulted them. Steve wasn\u2019t much\nfor physical violence, but when something looked off to him, he couldn\u2019t\nhelp screaming.\n\nI sympathize because I can see this in myself. Something that\u2019s perfect\njust feels much, much better than something that\u2019s almost right. When\nI\u2019m doing something myself, I can just sit there and work at it until\nit\u2019s *exactly* right. It\u2019s embarrassing to launch a product with a bug\nin it! It physically hurts when I realize that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. But as\nprojects and companies grow, there are more and more people in between\nme and those tiny details. And then I face a choice: do I keep\ncomplaining until something\u2019s perfect or do I just let go and consider\nit somebody else\u2019s problem?\n\nSteve never let go. He continued to feel that founder\u2019s pain about\neverything in his life. When it was his project, he\u2019d make people stay\nlate until they got it right. When it was his company, he\u2019d go right to\nthe person responsible, even if they were 5 levels down in the org\nchart, and make them fix it. (\u201cAfter looking at a bunch of screenshots,\nJobs jumped up, grabbed a marker, and drew a simple rectangle on a\nwhiteboard. \u2018Here\u2019s the new application,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s got one window.\nYou drag your video into the window. Then you click the button that says\n\u201cBurn.\u201d That\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d (382))\n\nIn fact, it didn\u2019t matter whose company it was. He once sent his\nfresh-squeezed juice back to the kitchen three times in a row until they\ngot it right (527); when his cable box was frustrating him, he called\nthe CEO of Comcast. (\u201cI thought he was calling to say something nice\nabout it,\u201d the CEO recalled. \u201cInstead, he told me \u2018It sucks.\u2019\u201d (489))\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I like Jony Ive. He too clearly feels that pain (he once\ninsisted they hold up an entire product launch because he didn\u2019t like\nthe polish on the screws) but he doesn\u2019t lash out at people about it.\nInstead, he sits down with the people involved and works to fix the\nproblem until they get it just right.\n\nAsk Jobs about his viciousness and he insisted it was all for the best:\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that when you have really good people you\ndon\u2019t have to baby them\u2026A-plus players like to work together, and they\ndon\u2019t like it if you tolerate B work. Ask any member of that Mac team.\nThey will tell you it was worth the pain.\u201d Even Debi Coleman agreed: \u201cI\nconsider myself the absolute luckiest person in the world to have worked\nwith him.\u201d\n\nBut does it require so much pain? My hope is that I can be just as\nexacting, demand work just as good, without emotionally destroying\npeople in the process. I want to be a perfectionist *and* a nice guy. I\nwant to be Jony Ive.

They\nroutinely disappoint. But, for a moment, let\u2019s take the opposite\nscenario. What\u2019s the most that we could hope for?\n\nBarack Obama grew up middle class and black. Obviously intelligent, he\nleft school knowing he wanted to make a difference, but unsure how.\nInspired by the civil rights movement and SNCC, he joined various\nprogressive organizations like NYPIRG and worked as a community\norganizer.\n\nHe then entered law school and graduated highly, but instead of taking a\nclerkship went back to Chicago to write a book about race relations and,\nlater, run a voter registration drive. He taught Constitutional Law and\njoined the board of various progressive foundations. He turned his\nsights toward politics, where he\u2019s spent the last ten years,\nrepresenting largely progressive districts.\n\nThroughout his political career, he has been criticized for being overly\ncautious and moderate. But he\u2019s been taken unusual pains to reach out to\nleft-wing journals (including fairly obscure ones) who have leveled such\ncriticisms, talked to them personally, and tried to defend himself.\n\nIn his presidential campaign, he\u2019s raised hundreds of millions of\ndollars, much of it coming from small-dollar donors. He\u2019s built a\ngrassroots organization never seen before in this country, with millions\nof well-coordinated members. Through an incredibly well-executed\ncampaign and a series of eloquent speeches, he seems poised to take the\npresidency with both houses of Congress, a solid majority, and a strong\nmandate.\n\nThis is unique. He hasn\u2019t spent enough time in politics to get chewed up\nby the system. He hasn\u2019t become dependent on a handful of big-money\ndonors. He comes from a background of progressive politics. And he has\nan army of cash and people behind him.\n\nLet\u2019s say he wanted to reform health care, an issue towards the top of\nAmericans\u2019 minds and a task that\u2019s necessary to balance the budget and\nget real wages rising again. The majority of the country supports a\nsingle-payer program, like in every other industrialized nation, but\nbecause of the vast influence of money in politics, it\u2019s often been\nconsidered politically impossible to achieve.\n\nBut Obama could pull it off. With his eloquence, he could easily sell\nthe plan to the country. The Democratic majority in both houses would\nget him most of the votes he needed. With his fundraising and volunteer\nnetwork, he could threaten to have primary challengers replace any\nCongresspeople who disagree. (Obama personally has raised around \\$700M.\nThe average Congressional campaign costs less than \\$1M.) With his\ntactical shrewdness, he could outwit industry lobbying groups.\n\nAcross a wide variety of such issues, it\u2019s possible to imagine a\nPresident Obama getting such things done. He has sufficient skill,\nbackground, and power to pull it off. It\u2019s hard to imagine a similar\nsituation in history. (FDR, who Obama is often compared to, came from a\nvery upper-class background and was strongly pulled by the far-left\ninspired by the Depression.)\n\nDo I think it will happen? No. The far-right spent these final days\nshrieking that Obama is a closet socialist who will take this country\ninto a new era of single-payer health care, strong financial regulation,\nrevitalized unions, progressive taxation, a green economy, and universal\nvoting rights. I wish it were so.\n\nInstead, Obama has proposed the most moderate and cautious plan of all\nDemocratic candidates, repeatedly refused to make ideological challenges\nout of fear of alienating voters, caved on even obvious questions like\nillegal wiretapping, surrounded himself with old centrist party hacks,\nand spent most of his campaign arguing for vague generalities like\n\u201cchange\u201d rather than specific policy proposals. So all signs point to\nObama being another cautious moderate.\n\nBut the striking thing is that none of these are dispositive. It\u2019s\npossible to imagine that, like W, Obama has run a quiet campaign focused\non building an electoral majority which he plans to use to push through\nthe policies he truly favors. It\u2019s implausible (the hardest thing to\nexplain away is the FISA vote; even my most hopeful side can\u2019t think of\nany decent explanation for that) but it is possible. And it will only be\nmore likely if we fight for it.\n\nIf we don\u2019t it seems Obama\u2019s most likely path is to become what the\nleft\u2019s pundits call \u201ca more competent steward of empire\u201d \u2014 do a bunch of\nreasonable, sensible things that will probably have quite positive\neffects on the lives of most Americans, while leaving all the\nfundamentals untouched.

Physicists can isolate atoms\nand run an experiment; historians have to try to find clever ways to\nmake a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d.\n\nObviously, the progress has to be actual, rather than simply perceived,\nwhich is indeed a common confusion in the social sciences, but real\nobservers of science should reconsider who they esteem.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1152601200.0, "postid": "hardscience", "internal_links": []}, "gettingitright": {"post_title": "Getting It Right", "tags": [], "post_content": "Getting It Right\n================\n\nOctober 13, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitright)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting little experiment you can do. If you have a\nclassroom of kids and you give them a bunch of tasks they can work on of\nvarying difficulty, the kids will pick the tasks that are just outside\ntheir level, that stretch them to do a little bit more.

In *Amazing\nGrace*, Jonathan Kozol writes heart-wrenchingly about life in East St.\nLouis. And a little closer to home, in the shining Valley city of Palo\nAlto, the workers and their families (as usual, mostly people of color)\nare shunted into East Palo Alto at the end of the day.\n\nNot only does this keep the workers and their families out of sight and\nout of crime, but it has beneficial political effects too. The workers\nmay elect their own mayor, who is economically powerless to do anything\nabout their plight, and they may attend their own school system,\nmaintaining the new racial and economic segregation of American schools.\n(Incidentally, Stanford recently purchased East Palo Alto High School so\nit can run experiments on the poor children.)\n\nIt would be absurd and offensive to compare life in San Francisco to\nlife in these impoverished neighborhoods, but I can\u2019t help but feel\nthere are some structural similarities. Whatever else San Francisco is,\nit is a reaction to the Valley. Many of the people I\u2019ve met here are\ndoing their best to escape their stifling Silicon Valley jobs, taking\nthe bus or train or car every day into work, then running back as soon\nas they can.\n\nThe result is that San Francisco ends up being something like the\nopposite of the Valley. The Valley has its clean if gray office\nbuildings in neat squares; San Francisco has its rough and random dirty\nshops and houses drizzled across hillsides. The Valley is full of\nconservative corporate behavior; San Francisco is full of left-wing\nactivists. The Valley is where people work, so San Francisco is where\nthey play, throwing frisbees in parks and hanging out in coffee shops or\ngoing to dance parties at night. The Valley is a place of businesslike\nbehavior; in San Francisco people hug deeply when they meet. (Not\neveryone, of course; none of this is everyone, but more than enough to\nbe noticeable.)\n\nThe result, like some Marxist dialectic, is that neither the City nor\nthe Valley really feel real. Both are reacting against each other,\nplaying off their faults, waiting for some synthesis to put the pieces\nback together. The result is, to be sane you have to be in both.\n\nCity people refer to Palo Alto as Shallow Alto, which might even be\nliterally true. The city is a thin strip of road, surrounded on one side\nby houses and on the other by offices, with Stanford behind it and other\ncities in front. It is, perhaps, a decent place to work \u2014 the finest\nupscale fakery you can find along relatively clean streets where even\nthe homeless are white \u2014 but it\u2019s apparently a terribly boring place to\nlive.\n\nMeanwhile the city is all action. People are \u201cintellectually lazy\u201d here,\ncomplains one resident. You can zip around on bikes and scooters, drop\ninto parties and nightclubs, gab with friends, eat good food, stroll by\nshops, do everything but actually get work done. People here are fleeing\nfrom work, not looking for it.\n\nAnd so, to live, you ping-pong back and forth. A job you hate in the\nValley, but you have to keep it so that it pays the exorbitant rent in\nthe City, which you have to live in to escape the deadliness of the\nValley. High highs, low lows, bright nights, dark days.\n\nI suspect the City works as an escape valve in other ways. Instead of\nunioninizing your big corporate employer, you simply flee to a False\nProfit party, secure in your anti-capitalist sentiment. Instead of\nworking to build a better life, you go out dancing with your friends,\ntrying to enjoy the little time you have.\n\nWhich, I have to say, is better than most. Most office drones just go\nhome and watch TV, their work having drained from them the energy for\nany more productive activity. I suspect some of the difference lies in\nthe peculiar economics of the computer industry. The people in it are\nunusually smart and talented. And the barriers to entry are so low that\nif they wanted to they could start their own thing (and, as the startup\nworld shows, many do). So perhaps one has to \u201cheighten the distractions\u201d\nto keep them busy.\n\nBut who knows?

Most people seem to agree that there are \u201cright\u201d\nthings and \u201cwrong\u201d things and we should try to do the right ones, but\nthey\u2019re less clear on how to figure out what the right ones are.\n\nSome say there are certain moral rules (don\u2019t murder, don\u2019t steal) that\nwe must follow to be right. But how do you decide what those rules are?\nMany such rules have been proposed; how do we pick the good ones?\n\nIf you ask someone to justify a rule, they usually do it by listing its\n*consequences*: if we don\u2019t steal, God will reward us; everyone will be\nhappier if we stop killing. In the end, it seems like everything boils\ndown to consequences: good acts are those which accomplish good things.\n\nSo how do we decide what good things are? Doesn\u2019t everyone have their\nown idea of what\u2019s good? Instead of trying to promote one particular\nperson\u2019s notion of what\u2019s good, it seems like we should balance\neveryone\u2019s good. In most cases, it\u2019s impossible for us to know what\u2019s\nactually good for a person, so this usually means taking their word for\nit and trying to give them what they *want*.\n\n(Cases where people don\u2019t seem to want what\u2019s good for them are usually\ncases where people are confused about what they want. I may think I\nreally want to eat this whole box of cookies but later I\u2019ll realize I\nreally wish I hadn\u2019t.)\n\nBut everyone wants different things \u2014 how do we balance their desires?\nIt seems like the only fair thing to do is to treat everyone equally. Of\ncourse, this doesn\u2019t mean treating every want equally: if one person\nwants a yacht and another person wants a dry place to sleep tonight, the\nsecond want seems much stronger than the first; filling it will\naccomplish more overall good.\n\nHere\u2019s another way to look at this. Imagine that before we were born, we\nall sat up in the heavens and talked about how to design the world. None\nof us yet know which bodies we would be born into or which parents we\u2019d\nhave, so none of us can possibly be biased. Aren\u2019t we all going to want\nto promote the greatest good overall? We\u2019ll make sure the worst-off\naren\u2019t particularly worse-off in case we\u2019re one of them, and we\u2019ll make\nsure the rest aren\u2019t especially handicapped in case we\u2019re one of\nthem.^[1](#fn:p)^ If we have to choose between a world with one more\nyacht for Larry Ellison and one with one more dry place to sleep for a\nwoman in poverty, we\u2019ll probably pick the dry place.\n\nSo we have our simple moral principle: when faced with a question, pick\nthe answer that will accomplish the most overall good. Two friends both\nwant to borrow my TV tonight, but one already has a TV and just wants it\nso he can watch two channels at once, while the other can\u2019t afford even\na single television. Our principle suggests the TV goes to the second.\n\nBut our principle doesn\u2019t just apply to the questions we\u2019re obviously\nfaced with. Surely there are many other people who want a TV and have\neven less than my friend. By our logic, they would seem to deserve the\nTV even more, even though they didn\u2019t happen to be asking me for it and\nthus forcing me to confront the question.\n\nIt seems like we need to think more carefully about the implicit\nquestion of each moment: what do I do now \u2014 with my time, my money, my\npossessions? And it seems like we need to apply the same moral rule.\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable: we must live our lives to promote the\nmost overall good. And that would seem to mean helping those most in\nwant \u2014 the world\u2019s poorest people.\n\nOur rule demands one do everything they can to help the poorest \u2014 not\njust spending one\u2019s wealth and selling one\u2019s possessions, but breaking\nthe law if that will help. I have friends who, to save money, break into\nbuildings on the MIT campus to steal food and drink and naps and\nshowers. They use the money they save to promote the public good. It\nseems like these criminals, not the average workaday law-abiding\ncitizen, should be our moral exemplars.\n\nSuch a thorough-going conception of ethics seems incredibly difficult.\nSurely it requires severe changes in our life. The traditional notion of\nethics is much easier \u2014 there are some bad things (stealing, lying,\ncheating) and we need to try our best not to do them. But, as in any\nfield, it\u2019s important to separate the truth from what\u2019s convenient.\nPeople are often criticized for not doing what they think is right\n(hypocrisy), but not believing in what\u2019s right because it\u2019s hard to do\nis far worse!\n\nI am convinced that the account here is largely correct, but I certainly\ndon\u2019t live up to its demanding standards. And that\u2019s OK. One of the\nconclusions of this argument is that it\u2019s impossible to be perfectly\nmoral. By accepting that, and keeping it in the back of my mind, I do a\nlittle better each day.\n\nFor a long time, people told me eating meat was wrong and I refused to\nbelieve them, because I thought it would be impossible for me not to eat\nmeat. Then one day, I accepted that they were right and I was doing the\nwrong thing and I decided I could live with that. I wasn\u2019t perfect. But\nshortly after I decided that, meat started seeming less and less\nattractive, and I started eating less and less, and now I don\u2019t eat it\nat all anymore.\n\nAccepting you\u2019re immoral is the first step to being a more moral person.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Being\nextraordinarily bad at saying no, I said yes. I asked what they wanted\nme to talk about and they said I could speak about whatever I liked. I\nthought about it for a while and concluded that I should talk about my\nlife and how I got out of a small town in the middle of the country and\nended up working with famous people. Due to a timing screw up, I didn\u2019t\nget to spend as much time on it as I liked, but I did my best. I can put\nthe draft up if anyone wants it. (**Update:** [Here\u2019s the talk, as\nprepared.](http://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget))\n\n(My hope was that talking about all these things would give people lots\nof different subjects to ask questions on, and then I could go into more\ndetail about whatever interested people. But oddly, the questions were\ninstead mostly about the few things I\u2019d left out of the narrative. I\nwonder if that means I addressed everything in enough detail that I\nanswered all their questions or whether I didn\u2019t talk about the things\nthey actually cared about.)\n\nGiving a talk via videoconference is a painful thing. First, your\ndisembodied head is looming six feet tall over a room of people. It\u2019s\nhard to imagine that\u2019s attractive to anyone other than Big Brother\u2019s\nmost ardent fan. Second, you have only the blurriest view of the\naudience you\u2019re speaking to. Third, you can\u2019t hear whether they\u2019re\nlaughing or not, because if you get an audio channel then all you hear\nis the delayed sound of your own voice repeated back to you \u2014 which is\nincredibly distracting \u2014 so instead all you get is silence. It\u2019s\nincredibly difficult to connect with an audience under these conditions.\n\nStill, I did my best, and I\u2019m told it went reasonably well. I sure had\nfun \u2014 there\u2019s a real buzz you get from speaking before an audience,\nwhether it\u2019s on the radio or via videocast or in person. Suddenly your\ndepression and thirst and hunger melt away and you just light up with\nenthusiasm and energy. The students who filled the room I was addressing\napplauded and thanked me; but in truth I really owe a debt to them.\n\n(**P.S.** If you did attend the talk, I\u2019d love your honest feedback on\nhow it went.

There\u2019s a social norm that how much we discuss something\nshould be roughly proportional to its importance. Mountains of print may\nbe spilled on the issues of international relations but spending a\ncouple emails [discussing\npunctuation](http://daringfireball.net/2003/03/antialiasing) would seem\ndreadfully bizarre.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: I *enjoy* deep discussions of punctuation and\nother trivialities. I could try to justify this taste \u2014 some argument\nthat we should think about everything we do so that we don\u2019t do\neverything we think about \u2014 but why bother? Do I have to justify\nenjoying certain television shows as well? At some point, isn\u2019t pure\nenjoyment just enough? After all, [time isn\u2019t\nfungible](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity).\n\nBut of course, the same drive that leads me to question punctuation\nleads me to question the drive itself, and thus this essay.\n\nWhat is \u201cthis drive\u201d? It\u2019s the tendency to not simply accept things as\nthey are but to want to think about them, to understand them. To not be\ncontent to simply feel sad but [to ask what sadness\nmeans](http://www.plover.com/blog/aliens/emotions.html). To not just get\na bus pass but [to think about the economic reasons getting a bus pass\nmakes\nsense](http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/weblog/nb.cgi/view/vitanuova/2005/11/04/0).\nI call this tendency the intellectual.\n\nThe word \u201cintellectual\u201d has a bit of a bad rap. When I think of the word\nI hear a man with a southern accent sneering at it. But this stain seems\nappropriate \u2014 *the idea* has a bad rap.\n\nAnd why is that? One reason is that many people simply don\u2019t like to\nthink about things. Perhaps it reminds them of school, which they didn\u2019t\nenjoy, and they don\u2019t want to go back there. Another is that they\u2019re\nbusy people \u2014 men of action \u2014 and they don\u2019t have time to sit and think\nabout every little detail. But mostly it\u2019s just because they think it\u2019s\na waste of time. What\u2019s the point? What difference does it make what you\nthink about punctuation? It\u2019s not going to affect anything.\n\nThis is the argument that\u2019s often used when demonizing intellectuals. As\nThomas Frank summarizes the argument:\n\n> The same bunch of sneaking intellectuals are responsible for the\n> content of Hollywood movies and for the income tax, by which they\n> steal from the rest of us. They do no useful work, producing nothing\n> but movies and newspaper columns while they freeload on the labor of\n> others. (116)\n\nWhen I think of intellectuals, though, I don\u2019t really think of Hollywood\nproducers or politicians or even newspaper columnists. But the people I\ndo think of seem to have something else in common. They don\u2019t just love\nthinking, they love language. They love its tricks and intricacies, its\ngames, the way it gets written down, the books it gets written into, the\nlibraries those books are in, and the typography those books use.\n\nUpon reflection this makes perfect sense. Language is the medium of\nthought and so it\u2019s no surprise that someone who spends a lot of time\nthinking spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate their\nthoughts as well. And indeed, all the intellectuals that come to mind\nwrite, not because they have to or get paid to, but simply for its own\nsake. What good is thinking if you can\u2019t share?\n\nThis contrasts with how intellectuals are commonly thought of \u2014 namely\nas pretentious elitist snobs. But real intellectuals, at least in the\nsense I\u2019m using the term, are anything but. They love nothing more than\nexplaining their ideas so that anyone who\u2019s interested can understand\nthem. They only seem pretentious because discussing such things is so\nbizarre.\n\nThis stereotype actually seems more like the caricature of the academic\nthan the intellectual. (It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that most of the\nintellectuals I can think of *aren\u2019t* academics or at least have left\nthe academy.) Far from being intellectuals, academics are encouraged to\nbe almost the opposite. Instead of trying to explain things simply,\nthey\u2019re rewarded for making them seem more complicated. Instead of\ntrying to learn about everything, they\u2019re forced to focus in on their\nlittle subdiscipline. Instead of loving books, they have to love gabbing\n\u2014 up in front of class or at office hour with students or at\nprofessional conferences or faculty meetings.\n\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. At the beginning I declined\nto justify my being an intellectual on any grounds other than pure\npersonal enjoyment. And here, at the end, I can\u2019t think of any better\njustification. Certainly people should think deeply about their actions\nand the world\u2019s problems and other important topics. But the other ones?\nThat\u2019s little more than personal preference.\n", "external_links": ["http://daringfireball.net/2003/03/antialiasing", "http://www.plover.com/blog/aliens/emotions.html", "http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/weblog/nb.cgi/view/vitanuova/2005/11/04/0"], "time": 1145257200.0, "postid": "intellectuals", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity"]}, "mrmillionaire": {"post_title": "Mr. Millionaire", "tags": [], "post_content": "Mr. Millionaire\n===============\n\nNovember 6, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mrmillionaire)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*While I\u2019m moving I\u2019ll be running old tortured-psyche fiction pieces.\nThis one was written in August of 2005, shortly after the first Summer\nFounders Program ended.*\n\nI kiss my girlfriend goodbye before walking down the front steps into\nthe waiting cab.

Here\u2019s my response.*\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, there were four of us crammed into a dingy\nlittle three-bedroom apartment (I slept in a kitchen cabinet). Every\nmorning we\u2019d wake up and stumble into the small space that I think was\nsupposed to be a living room, where we\u2019d placed desks along all four\nwalls (Steve\u2019s wall had a small window, with a beautiful view of the\nwall of the next building over, just a couple feet away). The sky would\nbe gray, the floor would be filthy, and we\u2019d be three feet floors away\nfrom the rest of the world. Looking back, it\u2019s hard to see how we got\nany work done. Actually, looking back, I\u2019m not sure we did.\n\nAside from the filth, my memories of those days mostly consist of an\nunending series of petty annoyances and frustrations. It\u2019s hard spending\nyour working days in such close quarters with other people. It\u2019s even\nharder when you spend your nights there too. And it\u2019s almost impossible\nwhen you\u2019re all high-strung socially-awkward geeks. Tensions frequently\nflared.\n\nNot that there wasn\u2019t a lot to get flared about. There were always bugs\nor complaints or new features you just couldn\u2019t get to work. And when\nyou finally got the site working fine, a new storm of traffic would\noverwhelm things and you\u2019d be back to picking up the pieces, making it\nrun faster and more reliably.\n\nThere were lots of problems, but somehow we got over them. Take a nap,\nwalk the fifteen minutes into town to get some food, go across the\nstreet to the abandoned playground, or, when things got really bad, just\nlook at that ever-growing traffic graph. We must be doing something\nright, we figured, or at least not doing much that\u2019s particularly wrong.\n\nWhile behind the scenes work was a disaster, in public things were going\ngreat. Every time we went out, more people seemed to know what Reddit\nwas. We started selling Reddit t-shirts and people wearing them and\nrecognizing started to pop up over town. One fan, on a short trip to\nBoston, even made a pilgrimage to our apartment and stole the Reddit\nsticker off our door. (We only found out where the missing sticker had\ngone when he bragged about it on his blog.) Reddit heads started\nappearing on more and more weblogs and sites I read started talking\nabout Reddit as if they assumed everyone already knew what it was.\n\nAt parties, the awkwardness of trying to tell people what we did for a\nliving (\u201cWe, uh, build a website. You know, it\u2019s kind of a news-type\nwebsite.\u201d) gave way to recognition (\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve heard of that\nsite.\u201d), and then to profuse thanks for a great time-waster. Towards the\nend, actual introductions became unnecessary \u2014 people started\nrecognizing us and coming up to say hi.\n\nWhen I went home to visit my family, my dad insisted on setting up a\nmeeting for me with a magazine publisher he knew. I was sure the visit\nwould be a disaster \u2014 why would a magazine publisher take a punk kid\nlike me seriously? \u2014 but once she heard our monthly visitor numbers, she\nwas eager to start a partnership. The same scene repeated itself over\nand over.\n\nEven when people had no idea what we did, the traffic gave us\nconfidence. Once we won a free meal at a restaurant (actually, we won at\nleast three different times) in exchange for suffering through a short\nlecture about financial planning opportunities. As the man talked about\nbeing sure to put money away for a safe day, we looked at each other\nknowingly. Either we\u2019d sell big or blow up entirely. Staying safe just\nwasn\u2019t in our vocabulary.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1162886400.0, "postid": "earlydays", "internal_links": []}, "personalitytests": {"post_title": "Trials of Testing", "tags": ["health", "psychology"], "post_content": "Trials of Testing\n=================\n\nOctober 28, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/personalitytests)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Since many readers complained about [the previous\npiece](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/humanmysteries) we have pulled it\nand provided this replacement.

The idea seems equally\npreposterous but it held real sway in its era \u2014 the Massachusetts\nMedical Association and the president of Harvard threw their weight\nbehind it (Paul, 7) and phrenology continues to be remembered today.\n\nSuch absurd ideas are not remnants of a bygone past \u2014 just replace\n\u201corgans\u201d with \u201cgenes\u201d and you\u2019ll have the new \u201cscience\u201d of evolutionary\npsychology (formerly sociobiology), an absurdity which Harvard\nUniversity\u2019s own president has thrown the institution\u2019s weight behind.\nAnd yet one rarely sees \u201cpro-science skeptics\u201d challenging its claims.\nIndeed, scientific magazines write them up with only minor questioning,\nsaving their ire for those who dare criticize the ideas.\n\nBut at least such fields have critics (and I count myself among them).\nThere are related claims, however, that exercise much more power over\nour lives and (perhaps as a result) are far less challenged. One of\ntheir creators explained that they would \u201cpromote personal development\u201d,\n\u201cmanage conflict\u201d, and \u201cincrease human understanding worldwide.\u201d (Paul,\n121) But instead of Vedic science, she was talking about here creation:\nthe Myers-Briggs personality test.\n\nI have written before about the failures of experiments to provide\nevidence in favor of our concepts of\n[personality](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001595) or\n[intelligence](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001606) and how despite\nthis many continue to believe in them. One can discuss how even studies\nby proponents find that IQ lacks validity and that 47% of people have a\ndifferent Myers-Briggs personality type on a second administration of a\ntest. But this somehow seems not to convince. So let us try another\ntack: let us look at how these tests are made.\n\nThe history of the IQ test \u2014 along with a number of other supposed ways\nof measuring \u201cintelligence\u201d \u2014 is detailed in Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s classic\n*The Mismeasure of Man*. It was originally created by Alfred Binet to\nfind children in French schools who might need special tutoring. Binet\nthought that by locating and helping these students, one could make sure\nthat everyone learned all the material. Binet composed the test by\nthrowing together whatever questions came to mind: things about shapes\nand numbers and words. He just wanted to see if some kids were having\ntrouble, he made no attempt to make sure the result was a balanced\nmeasure of \u201cintelligence\u201d.\n\nLewis Terman, a professor at Stanford University, imported the Binet\ntest to America, added some more random things and mixed it all up a\nlittle, and called the result the Stanford-Binet intelligence test (a\nname which is still used today).^[1](#fn:n)^ One of the test\u2019s first\napplications was American Psychological Association president Robert\nYerkes\u2019s attempt to classify the people recruited for the Army. Among\nthe questions:\n\n> Crisco is a: patent medicine, disinfectant, toothpaste, food product\\\n>  The number of a Kaffir\u2019s legs is: 2, 4, 6, 8\\\n>  Christy Mathewson is famous as a: writer, artist, baseball player,\n> comedian\n\nRecent immigrants, whose command of English might be understandably\nweak, were allowed to take a pictorial version: drawing \u201ca rivet in a\npocket knife, a filament in a light bulb, a horn on a phonograph, a net\non a tennis court, and a ball in a bowler\u2019s hand (marked wrong, Yerkes\nexplained, if an examinee drew the ball in the alley, for you can tell\nfrom the bowler\u2019s posture that he has not yet released the ball).\u201d\n(Gould, 230)\n\nTerman, meanwhile, conducted a longitudinal study of the people his IQ\ntest marked as \u201cgifted\u201d. Joel Shurkin, based on exclusive access to the\nrecords, documented the full story in his book *Terman\u2019s Kids*. Among\nthe study\u2019s participants was a man named Jess Oppenheimer. \u201cGave the\nimpression of being very pushy and forward although he did not show\nthese characteristics during the interview,\u201d wrote one of Terman\u2019s\nassistants. \u201cI could detect no signs of a sense of a humor.\u201d (Shurkin,\n54) Oppenheimer went on to create and write the shows *I Love Lucy* and\n*Get Smart*.\n\nThe story of personality tests is little better. In her book *The Cult\nof Personality* (recently republished as *The Cult of Personality\nTesting*), Annie Murphy Paul (a former senior editor for mass bi-monthly\n*Psychology Today*) describes the history of all the major personality\ntests. Take the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI),\nwhich was created in a similar way to the IQ test.\n\nThe test was created by psychologist Starke Hathaway and\nneuropsychiatrist J. Charnley McKinley by simply coming up with a bunch\nof true-or-false statements that they thought might indicate whether the\nrespondent had a mental illness. Among them:\n\n> I have never had any black, tarry-looking bowel movements.\\\n>  I have had no difficulty starting or holding my urine.\\\n>  I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices.\\\n>  There is something wrong with my sex organs.\\\n>  I believe there is a Devil and a Hell in the afterlife.\\\n>  Everything is turning out as the Bible said it would.\\\n>  I think I would like to belong to a motorcycle club.\\\n>  Often I feel as if there were a tight band around my head.\\\n>  I loved my father.\\\n>  I like to flirt.\\\n>  I believe my sins are unpardonable.\\\n>  I have a good appetite.\\\n>  I think Lincoln was greater than Washington.\\\n>  Women should not be allowed to drink in cocktail bars.\\\n>  A large number of people are guilty of bad sexual conduct.\\\n>  If the money were right, I would like to work for a circus or\n> carnival. (Paul, 53)\n\nThe resulting test was administered to the patients at the University of\nMinnesota mental hospital as well as the (presumably sane) staff there\n(all white, Protestant, Minnesotans who came to be known as the\n\u201cMinnesota Normals\u201d). Statistical analysis was then done to determine\nwhich questions more accurately predicted whether the user had a mental\nillness and more specifically, what kind.^[2](#fn:m)^\n\nThis was quickly generalized: people who scored above-average on the\nscales for Hysteria or Depression (but not high enough to actually have\na mental illness) could be said to have hysterical or depressive\n*personalities*, even though there was absolutely no evidence to support\nthis leap (not that it was on particularly sturdy ground to begin with).\n\nThe resulting test was used to analyze people in business, the army,\ncourt, high school, and at the doctor\u2019s. It was \u201cused to screen job\napplicants, offer vocational advice, settle custody disputes, and\ndetermine legal status.\u201d (Paul, 58f) And while the test engendered some\nbacklash, it continues to be used frequently today, often as the a\nrequirement for getting or keeping a job. Paul notes \u201cthe MMPI (in an\nupdated version) is employed by 86% of clinical psychologists and\nadministered, by one estimate, to 15 million Americans each year.\u201d (63)\nFor example, it is used by 60% of police departments to evaluate\nprospective officers. Meanwhile, studies show that such tests can reject\nas high as 60% of healthy applicants.\n\nThis is but one example \u2014 and one chapter in Paul\u2019s book \u2014 but all the\nothers all have similar stories. An absurd test, concocted through\nabsurd means, completely untested, ends up becoming a powerful societal\nforce. All the more reason for us to speak out about them.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Incidentally, although Terman did not put his name on the test, his\n    family continues to have a presence at Stanford. His son Frederick\n    Emmons Terman was a professor of engineering (and later provost);\n    the Terman Engineering Center, which was across the street from my\n    dorm, is named in his honor. And down the hall from me in my dorm\n    lived his daughter, who, in full disclosure, I ate meals with a\n    couple times.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:n)\n\n2.  Not that this methodology is necessarily flawed, although it leads\n    to some interesting conclusions. Paul writes that in one experiment,\n    the question \u201cthat yielded some of the most useful information\u201d\n    about whether someone had a fascist personality was: \u201cObedience and\n    respect for authority are the most important virtues children should\n    learn.\u201d (Paul, 147)\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:m)\n\n\n", "external_links": ["#fn:n", "#fn:m", "#fnref:n", "#fnref:m"], "time": 1130482800.0, "postid": "personalitytests", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/humanmysteries", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/humanmysteries", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001595", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001606"]}, "fundsoc": {"post_title": "The Fundamental Law of Sociology", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Fundamental Law of Sociology\n================================\n\nJanuary 23, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fundsoc)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere are some loons on the Internet trying to spread the idea that the\nfundamental law of sociology is the black-white test score gap.

It was about five\nyears ago now, when I looked up from the car and realized I couldn\u2019t\nsee. I had been staring at my computer a lot, and reading books when I\nwasn\u2019t doing that, so I didn\u2019t notice much, but that day, riding in the\ncar, I looked up and realized I couldn\u2019t read the street sign. I\ndefinitely used to be able to read that sign, but there it was, big and\nbright and green along the highway, and all I could make out was a blur.\nI had gone blind.\n\nLegally blind, as I learned yesterday. My vision is below the legal\nthreshold in the US for legal blindness. (Far below, as far as I can\ntell, but the eye exam chart doesn\u2019t really make fine-grained\ndistinctions at that level.) And yet, for five years, this never really\nbothered me. I never wore glasses for more than an hour, I squinted hard\nenough to pass the vision test at the DMV, I sat close to blackboards\nand listened carefully.\n\nI tried a couple things to improve my eyesight, but nothing very\nseriously. I tried, but it never seemed important enough to warrant the\neffort. And so I walked thru life, legally blind. I didn\u2019t really\nnotice.\n\nMy roommate, Quinn, has been nagging me about this. She wants me to get\nLASIK, I think largely because it involves lasers. But finally the other\nday I took some action and went to the optometrist.\n\nYou know those eye charts you see sometimes? The ones that famously\nstart with E at the top and then the letters get smaller and smaller? I\ncouldn\u2019t read the E. When I looked up at it, all I saw was a vague blur.\nSo they gave me contacts.\n\nContacts are an odd thing. They\u2019re almost invisible, malleable little\nthings that you can\u2019t see once they\u2019re stuck on your eye. One minute,\nyou\u2019re living a Monet-like existence of a world blurred, then tap your\neye and suddenly, invisibly, everything is clear.\n\nI had no idea the world really looked like this, with such infinite\nclarity. It looks like a modernist photo or a hyperreal film, everything\nin focus everywhere. Everyone kept saying \u201coh, do you see the leaves\nnow?\u201d but the first thing I saw was not the leaves but the people.\nPeople, individuated, each with brilliant faces and expressions at\ngaits, the sun streaming down upon them. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. It\u2019s\nmuch harder being a misanthrope when you can see people\u2019s faces.\n\nThen came the signs, the signs with messages I could read from a\ndistance. No longer would I have to carefully count my stops on the\nsubway because I couldn\u2019t read the station signs. And then the\nbuildings, their edges no longer fuzzy like clouds but hard and harsh\nand magnificent.\n\nI no longer feared myself, formerly this vague visage in the mirror that\nI had to look away from. Now in the mirror I could see my face, and even\nthought it looked good.\n\nThe resolution on my cameraphone suddenly seems insufficient. The crumbs\nand dirt in our apartment that previously drove my roommate crazy are\nnow visible enough to drive me crazy too. I can look people in the eye\nand smile and see them smile back. I can see the contours of their\nfaces. When I look up at night I can see the things in my room, even\nwhen the lights are off.\n\nMy eyes are open and I can now experience the beauty that\u2019s been more\nthan a few feet in front of my nose.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1180508400.0, "postid": "visionthing", "internal_links": []}, "falsecon": {"post_title": "The False Consciousness Falsehood", "tags": [], "post_content": "The False Consciousness Falsehood\n=================================\n\nMay 19, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/falsecon)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAmerican intellectual life has a large number of ways of responding to\nan argument without actually addressing its substance \u2014 namecalling in\nother words. You can say that someone is \u201cblaming the victim\u201d or\nspinning a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d or \u201cassuming people are stupid\u201d or that\nthey\u2019re subject to \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d.\n\nMost of these are kind of transparently silly, but even otherwise smart\npeople seem to think the false consciousness charge has some heft to it.\nThe argument is never fully spelled-out, but the argument seems to be\nthat to think that people are systematically mistaken about their own\ninterests is the kind of crazy idea that only vulgar Marxists would\nbelieve and, furthermore, it requires assuming that people are stupid\nand explaining how you\u2019ve been able to see past the illusion.\n\nWell, I\u2019m personally not under any illusion that providing a rational\nexplanation is going to stop people from leveling this charge, but I\nfigure one ought to, if only to set the record straight.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a parable \u2014 a simplified case that will at least\nestablish whether some of these arguments are logically true. Imagine a\nnew regime comes to power that decides to imprison everyone with red\nhair. They insist that there is nothing amiss about this \u2014 they were\nelected democratically, and furthermore, everyone imprisoned is still\nallowed to vote. But inside the prisons, they only permit limited\ncontact with the outside world. Most prisoners only watch the one\nprison-provided news station which is systematically biased, constantly\nsuggesting that the Purple Party is in favor of additional rights for\nred-haired people while their opponents, the Yellow Party, just used the\nred-haired issue for pandering. (Anyone who\u2019s watched, say, Fox News\ndiscuss black issues will know how this is possible.) The result is that\nwhen election time rolls around, the majority of red-haired prisoners\nvote for the Purple Party candidate who gets into power and provides no\nnew rights for them.\n\nCall it false consciousness or not, I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to\nlook at this situation and say while the red-haired prisoners are not\nstupid, they are systematically mistaken, which is leading them to act\nagainst their own interests. If they knew the truth they would vote for\nthe Yellow Party, the party which wants to take steps to get them out of\nprison, instead. Furthermore, it\u2019s possible to imagine that there are\nsome prisoners who, through one means or another, have learned this and\nthus are able to see this situation while the other prisoners do not.\n(They try to tell the other prisoners what\u2019s going on, but they keep\ngetting labeled conspiracy theorists.)\n\nNow obviously vast portions of America are not imprisoned. But most\npeople do get their news from a small number of sources and I think\neveryone would agree that, in one way or another, these sources are\nsystematically biased. (You can argue about which way they\u2019re biased or\nwhether it makes a difference, but I think it\u2019s pretty clear that all\nthe major news sources share a general conception of what is \u201cnews\u201d and\nwhat isn\u2019t.) So why is it so implausible that something similar is going\non?\n\nThe major difference between the two scenarios is that in the first,\npeople were basically forced to watch the biased news, while in the real\nworld they have lots of other alternatives. But I\u2019m not sure this\nmatters as much as it might seem at first.\n\nFirst, most people have busy lives that don\u2019t revolve around the news or\npolitics and thus are going to get the news in the most convenient form\nthey can. For most people, this is typically television or the\nnewspaper. But starting a new television station or newspaper is very\nexpensive, especially if you want it to have wide reach, and the only\nprojects that can get funding and advertising are those that buy into at\nleast some of the systematic biases. So for most people, there simply\nisn\u2019t a better alternative when it comes to the formats they want.\n\nSecond, even if someone gets their news from the Internet or another\nsource where getting started is less expensive, they may not know about\nthe alternatives. If you grew up with your parents reading the *New York\nTimes* you may simply live your life checking in on nytimes.com, without\never stopping to wonder whether the news you were getting was\nsystematically biased and whether there was some more preferable\nalternative.\n\nAgain, just as there was no way for the prisoners to know they were\nbeing lied to, it\u2019s not really reasonable for the average person to\nfigure out that they\u2019re getting biased news if the only news they read\ncomes from biased sources.\n\nNow I\u2019m not arguing here that this idea is *true* (that would require\nmore real-world evidence), merely that it\u2019s possible. The fact is that\nwe live in a world where most people get their information about what\u2019s\ngoing on from a very small number of sources which tend to report\nlargely the same things in the same way. This seems like a rather\nimportant fact of life and I think we ought to stop dismissing\nsuggestions that it might have some negative effects on people out of\nhand.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1211180400.0, "postid": "falsecon", "internal_links": []}, "serenity2": {"post_title": "Serenity: A Review", "tags": [], "post_content": "Serenity: A Review\n==================\n\nSeptember 29, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/serenity2)\n\n* * * * *\n\nJoss Whedon\u2019s film *[Serenity](http://serenitymovie.com/)* comes out\ntomorrow, the first new episode of his series *Firefly* in years.

That means bringing in Republicans,\noccupying the rhetorical (if not political) center, and passing\nincremental steps that lead to lasting change. But most importantly, it\nmeans being effective. We don\u2019t need partisans, we need people with\nexperience who can get things done.

A progressive cabinet can\nmove the ball forward by having their agencies implement countless small\nreforms while using their status as public figures to build support for\nbigger ones. All of which will further cement the Democrats\u2019 reputation\nas the party of progress. The country isn\u2019t left-wing because it likes\npeople with blue logos and D\u2019s next to their names; it\u2019s left-wing\nbecause it wants shared prosperity and security.

Sure, during the Bush\nAdministration they had to spend all their time fighting bad ideas, but\nwith a Democratic president they can start rallying support for good\nones.\n\nAnd a President who leads as a consensus figure will be much more\neffective at passing them.

Can they get stuff done? Can\nyou work with them? Someone who\u2019s smart but doesn\u2019t get stuff done\nshould be your friend, not your employee. You can talk your problems\nover with them while they procrastinate on their actual job. Someone who\ngets stuff done but isn\u2019t smart is inefficient: non-smart people get\nstuff done by doing it the hard way and working with them is slow and\nfrustrating. Someone you can\u2019t work with, you can\u2019t work with.\n\nThe traditional programmer hiring process consists of: a) reading a\nresume, b) asking some hard questions on the phone, and c) giving them a\nprogramming problem in person. I think this is a terrible system for\nhiring people. You learn very little from a resume and people get real\nnervous when you ask them tough questions in an interview. Programming\nisn\u2019t typically a job done under pressure, so seeing how people perform\nwhen nervous is pretty useless. And the interview questions usually\nasked seem chosen just to be cruel. I think I\u2019m a pretty good\nprogrammer, but I\u2019ve never passed one of these interviews and I doubt I\never could.\n\nSo when I hire people, I just try to answer the three questions. To find\nout if they can get stuff done, I just ask what they\u2019ve done. If someone\ncan actually get stuff done they should have done so by now. It\u2019s hard\nto be a good programmer without some previous experience and these days\nanyone can get some experience by starting or contributing to a free\nsoftware project. So I just request a code sample and a demo and see\nwhether it looks good. You learn an enormous amount really quickly,\nbecause you\u2019re not watching them answer a contrived interview question,\nyou\u2019re seeing their actual production code. Is it concise? clear?\nelegant? usable? Is it something you\u2019d want in your product?\n\nTo find out whether someone\u2019s smart, I just have a casual conversation\nwith them. I do everything I can to take off any pressure off: I meet at\na cafe, I make it clear it\u2019s not an interview, I do my best to be casual\nand friendly. Under no circumstances do I ask them any standard\n\u201cinterview questions\u201d \u2014 I just chat with them like I would with someone\nI met at a party. (If you ask people at parties to name their greatest\nstrengths and weaknesses or to estimate the number of piano tuners in\nChicago, you\u2019ve got bigger problems.) I think it\u2019s pretty easy to tell\nwhether someone\u2019s smart in casual conversation. I constantly make\njudgments about whether people I meet are smart, just like I constantly\nmake judgments about whether people I see are attractive.\n\nBut if I had to write down what it is that makes someone seem smart, I\u2019d\nemphasize three things. First, do they know stuff? Ask them [what\nthey\u2019ve been thinking about](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq)\nand probe them about it. Do they seem to understand it in detail? Can\nthey explain it clearly? (Clear explanations are a sign of genuine\nunderstanding.) Do they know stuff about the subject that you don\u2019t?\n\nSecond, are they curious? Do they reciprocate by asking questions about\nyou? Are they genuinely interested or just being polite? Do they ask\nfollow-up questions about what you\u2019re saying? Do their questions make\nyou think?\n\nThird, do they learn? At some point in the conversation, you\u2019ll probably\nbe explaining something to them. Do they actually understand it or do\nthey just nod and smile? There are people who know stuff about some\nsmall area but aren\u2019t curious about others. And there are people who are\ncurious but don\u2019t learn, they ask lots of questions but don\u2019t really\nlisten. You want someone who does all three.\n\nFinally, I figure out whether I can work with someone just by hanging\nout with them for a bit. Many brilliant people can seem delightful in a\none-hour conversation, but their eccentricities become grating after a\ncouple hours. So after you\u2019re done chatting, invite them along for a\nmeal with the rest of the team or a game at the office. Again, keep\nthings as casual as possible. The point is just to see whether they get\non your nerves.\n\nIf all that looks good and I\u2019m ready to hire someone, there\u2019s a final\nsanity check to make sure I haven\u2019t been fooled somehow: I ask them to\ndo part of the job. Usually this means picking some fairly separable\npiece we need and asking them to write it. (If you really insist on\nseeing someone working under pressure, give them a deadline.) If\nnecessary, you can offer to pay them for the work, but I find most\nprogrammers don\u2019t mind being given a small task like this as long as\nthey can open source the work when they\u2019re done. This test doesn\u2019t work\non its own, but if someone\u2019s passed the first three parts, it should be\nenough to prove they didn\u2019t trick you, they can actually do the work.\n\n(I\u2019ve known some people who say \u201cOK, well why don\u2019t we try hiring you\nfor a month and see how it goes.\u201d This doesn\u2019t seem to work. If you\ncan\u2019t make up your mind after a small project you also can\u2019t make it up\nafter a month and you end up hiring people who aren\u2019t good enough.\nBetter to just say no and err on the side of getting better people.)\n\nI\u2019m fairly happy with this method. When I\u2019ve skipped parts, I\u2019ve ended\nup with bad hires who eventually had to be let go. But when I\u2019ve\nfollowed it, I\u2019ve ended up with people I like so much so that I actually\nfeel bad I don\u2019t get to work with them anymore. I\u2019m amazed that so many\ncompanies use such silly hiring methods instead.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1259481600.0, "postid": "hiring", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hiring.es", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq"]}, "mametacting": {"post_title": "Mamet on Auditions", "tags": [], "post_content": "Mamet on Auditions\n==================\n\nOctober 8, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mametacting)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*A special guest post from David Mamet\u2019s* [True and\nFalse](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679772642). *The discussion is\nnotionally about acting, but it applies far more broadly.

It\u2019s about the \u201cmarketplace of\nideas\u201d some say: by putting all claims and points of view out in the\nopen, the public can sort through and figure out the truth, leaving the\nuntruths to fall by the wayside. Others argue that free speech is\nnecessary for democracy, since voters must hear different opinions to\ndecide how to use their votes, and that since even non-political speech\ncan change people\u2019s views, all speech must then be protected.\n\nThere are many more justifications like this \u2014 a limit on government\nabuse, a policy to promote a more tolerant citizenship, etc. \u2014 but, like\nmost justifications, they all say we should permit free speech because\nit allows us to do something else. And the frustrating thing about that\nis that it suggests that free speech should not be permitted when it\ndoesn\u2019t achieve those goals.\n\nTheorists of free speech are, in general, fans of the idea (or at least\ntheir market consists of fans) so they try to dance around this. \u201cOh\nno,\u201d the marketplace-of-ideas partisans say, \u201cwe weren\u2019t suggesting that\nobviously false statements could be prohibited because, after all, you\nreally never know when false statements could turn out to be true!\u201d\n\nBut, as [something of a free speech\nabsolutist](http://bits.are.notabug.com/), it troubles me that such a\nthing is even theoretically possible. And I worry that if others adopt\nthis theory, they may not be so stringent about the practical\nrequirements. The temptation to clamp down on free speech is always\nstrong; it\u2019s probably not a sound idea to build the principle on such a\nshaky foundation.\n\nSo I have my own justification for freedom of speech: because we can.\nHuman freedom is important, so we should try to protect it from\nencroachment wherever possible. With most freedoms \u2014 freedom of motion,\nfreedom of exchange, freedom of action \u2014 permitting them in full would\ncause some problems. People shouldn\u2019t be free to walk into other\npeople\u2019s bedrooms, take all their stuff, and then punch the poor victims\nin the face. But hurling a bunch of epithets at the guy really isn\u2019t so\nbad.\n\nFreedom of speech is one place where we can draw the line and say: all\nof this is acceptable. There\u2019s no further logic to it than that; freedom\nof speech is not an *instrumental* value. Like all freedom, it\u2019s\nfundamental, and the only reason we happen to single it out is because\nit\u2019s more reasonable than all of the others.\n\nClose readers will note that this theory doesn\u2019t quite live up to my own\ngoals. By laying freedom of speech\u2019s provision on top of our reasonable\nability to do so, I suggest that freedom of speech could be taken away\nif providing it became unreasonable. But I think this is the right\nchoice: if people really, seriously started getting hurt because of\nfreedom of speech, it seems right for people to take the privilege away.\nBut, to be honest, I can\u2019t even imagine how that might be possible.\nWords just don\u2019t genuinely wound, they\u2019re always mediated by our\nlistening.\n\nI do worry that people might try to stretch this justification \u2014 say\nthat continued free speech might destroy the war effort, or the\ngovernment, or civil society. But I have no problem destroying all of\nthose. It\u2019s only the destruction of actual people that I worry about.\n\nSo here\u2019s to free speech: because we can.\n", "external_links": ["http://bits.are.notabug.com/"], "time": 1164268800.0, "postid": "becausewecan", "internal_links": []}, "payforward": {"post_title": "Pay it Forward", "tags": [], "post_content": "Pay it Forward\n==============\n\nNovember 5, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/payforward)\n\n* * * * *\n\nA year or two ago, I suffered from a devastating server crash.

The audience, which consisted mostly of programmers and other\nhigh-level Wikipedians, immediately begun suggesting problems with the\nidea. \u201cWon\u2019t bad thing X happen?\u201d \u201cHow will you prevent Y?\u201d \u201cDo you\nreally think people are going to do Z?\u201d For a while I tried to answer\nthem, explaining technical ways to fix the problem, but after a couple\nrounds I finally said:\n\n> Stop.\n>\n> If I had come here five years ago and told you I was going to make an\n> entire encyclopedia by putting up a bunch of web pages that anyone\n> could edit, you would have been able to raise a thousand objections:\n> It will get filled with vandalism! The content will be unreliable! No\n> one will do that work for free!\n>\n> And you would have been right to. These were completely reasonable\n> expectations at the time. But here\u2019s the funny thing: it worked\n> anyway.\n\nAt the time, I was just happy this quieted them down. But later I\nstarted thinking more about it. Why did Wikipedia work anyway?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because its programmers were so far-sighted that the software\nsolved all the problems. And it wasn\u2019t because the people running it put\nclear rules in place to prevent misbehavior. We know this because when\nWikipedia started it didn\u2019t have any programmers (it used off-the-shelf\nwiki software) and it didn\u2019t have clear rules (one of the first major\nrules was apparently [Ignore all\nrules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules)).\n\nNo, the reason Wikipedia works is because of the community, a group of\npeople that took the project as their own and threw themselves into\nmaking it succeed.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPeople are constantly trying to vandalize Wikipedia, replacing articles\nwith random text. It doesn\u2019t work; their edits are undone within\nminutes, even seconds. But why? It\u2019s not magic \u2014 it\u2019s a bunch of\nincredibly dedicated people who sit at their computers watching every\nchange that gets made. These days they call themselves the \u201crecent\nchanges patrol\u201d and have special software that makes it easy to undo bad\nchanges and block malicious users with a couple clicks.\n\nWhy does anyone do such a thing? It\u2019s not particularly fascinating work,\nthey\u2019re not being paid to do it, and nobody in charge asked them to\nvolunteer. They do it because they care about the site enough to feel\nresponsible. They get upset when someone tries to mess it up.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone feeling this way about *Britannica*. There\nare people who love that encyclopedia, but have any of them shown up at\ntheir offices offering to help out? It\u2019s hard even to imagine. Average\npeople just don\u2019t feel responsible for *Britannica*; there are\nprofessionals to do that.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEverybody knows Wikipedia as the site anyone can edit. The article about\ntree frogs wasn\u2019t written because someone in charge decided they needed\none and assigned it to someone; it was written because someone,\nsomewhere just went ahead and started writing it. And a chorus of others\ndecided to help out.\n\nBut what\u2019s less well-known is that it\u2019s also the site that anyone can\nrun. The vandals aren\u2019t stopped because someone is in charge of stopping\nthem; it was simply something people started doing. And it\u2019s not just\nvandalism: a \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d says hi to every new user, a \u201ccleanup\ntaskforce\u201d goes around doing factchecking. The site\u2019s rules are made by\nrough consensus. Even the servers are largely run this way \u2014 a group of\nvolunteer sysadmins hang out on IRC, keeping an eye on things. Until\nquite recently, the Foundation that supposedly runs Wikipedia had no\nactual employees.\n\nThis is so unusual, we don\u2019t even have a word for it. It\u2019s tempting to\nsay \u201cdemocracy\u201d, but that\u2019s woefully inadequate. Wikipedia doesn\u2019t hold\na vote and elect someone to be in charge of vandal-fighting. Indeed,\n\u201cWikipedia\u201d doesn\u2019t do anything at all. Someone simply sees that there\nare vandals to be fought and steps up to do the job.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis is so radically different that it\u2019s tempting to see it as a\nmistake: Sure, perhaps things have worked so far on this model, but when\nthe real problems hit, things are going to have to change: certain\npeople must have clear authority, important tasks must be carefully\nassigned, everyone else must understand that they are simply volunteers.\n\nBut Wikipedia\u2019s openness isn\u2019t a mistake; it\u2019s the source of its\nsuccess. A dedicated community solves problems that official leaders\nwouldn\u2019t even know were there. Meanwhile, their volunteerism largely\neliminates infighting about who gets to be what. Instead, tasks get done\nby the people who genuinely want to do them, who just happen to be the\npeople who care enough to do them right.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s biggest problems have come when it\u2019s strayed from this path,\nwhen it\u2019s given some people official titles and specified tasks.\nWhenever that happens, real work slows down and squabbling speeds up.\nBut it\u2019s an easy mistake to make, so it gets made again and again.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not the only reason this mistake is made, it\u2019s just\nthe most polite. The more frightening problem is that people love to get\npower and hate to give it up. Especially with a project as big and\nimportant as Wikipedia, with the constant swarm of praise and attention,\nit takes tremendous strength to turn down the opportunity to be its\nofficial X, to say instead \u201cit\u2019s a community project, I\u2019m just another\ncommunity member\u201d.\n\nIndeed, the opposite is far more common. People who have poured vast\namounts of time into the project begin to feel they should be getting\nsomething in return. They insist that, with all their work, they\n*deserve* an official job or a special title. After all, won\u2019t clearly\nassigning tasks be better for everyone?\n\nAnd so, the trend is clear: more power, more people, more problems. It\u2019s\nnot just a series of mistakes, it\u2019s the tendency of the system.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt would be absurd for me to say that I\u2019m immune to such pressures.\nAfter all, I\u2019m currently running for a seat on the Wikimedia Board. But\nI also lie awake at night worrying that I might abuse my power.\n\nA systemic tendency like this is not going to be solved by electing the\nright person to the right place and then going to back to sleep while\nthey solve the problem. If the community wants to remain in charge, it\u2019s\ngoing to have to fight for it. I\u2019m writing these essays to help people\nunderstand that this is something worth fighting for. And if I\u2019m elected\nto the Board, I plan to keep on writing.\n\nJust as Wikipedia\u2019s success as an encyclopedia requires a world of\nvolunteers to write it, Wikipedia\u2019s success as an organization requires\nthe community of volunteers to run it. On the one hand, this means\nopening up the Board\u2019s inner workings for the community to see and get\ninvolved in. But it also means opening up the actions of the community\nso the wider world can get involved. Whoever wins this next election, I\nhope we all take on this task.\n", "external_links": ["http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Masao/WhoRunsWikipedia", "mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules"], "time": 1157612400.0, "postid": "whorunswikipedia", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw"]}, "kahlereport": {"post_title": "A Trip to the Courthouse: Part 1", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Trip to the Courthouse: Part 1\n================================\n\nNovember 27, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kahlereport)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe United State Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is a\nfederal-looking building nestled in among the offices and shops and\nbusiness parks of San Francisco\u2019s downtown. Large marble walls and\nstaircases try desperately to send the message that what goes on here is\nof paramount importance, that the decisions made in these halls will\nreverberate throughout a large part of the country: Alaska, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington \u2014 the\nlargest of any appeals court.\n\nBut, this morning, the courtroom tells a different story. With people\npacked like Sardines into a room not much bigger than a bedroom in a San\nFrancisco apartment, with one of the judges missing and replaced \u2014\nwithout explanation \u2014 with a large television, and with hesitant,\nstammering public defenders arguing their cases against only\nslightly-less-hesitant civil servants, I briefly wondered if I was in\nthe wrong room.\n\nThe first case I saw appeared to be a man requesting asylum in the US\nfrom his home country. I missed large portions of the case, but as I\npaid attention, the facts started coming out. He wanted asylum from\npersecution because he was gay. But the country he was hiding from\ndidn\u2019t exactly have a record of persecution of gays. And the only\nevidence of persecution he could point to was that a couple people on\nthe street once called him gay.\n\nThe next case seemed a little better for the non-government guy. It was\nabout a man who accused of defrauding Medicare by double-billing. He\nnoted that the Court had changed the law during the case; instead of\njust requiring the jury to find *whether* double-billing had occurred,\nit now required the jury to find how much. But they\u2019d made that change\nafter the trial, so he\u2019d never had a chance to present any evidence on\nhow much double-billing had occurred. His lawyer asked for a chance to\nhold a hearing to present the evidence.\n\n\u201cDo you have the evidence?\u201d a judge asked. The lawyer responded that he\ndidn\u2019t, because he was a public defender and needed to hire a\nprofessional accountant to look through the math, but couldn\u2019t afford to\nwithout a judge\u2019s permission, and the judge denied his request at the\nsame time he denied the hearing on the subject. But, he explained, the\ngovernment\u2019s accountant had admitted on the stand that there were\nmistakes in the math he presented, although he didn\u2019t know what impact\nthey had. Couldn\u2019t he just get a trial to assess the math? The judges\ndidn\u2019t seem to think so.\n\nIf the judges weren\u2019t going to give a victory on that case, they really\nweren\u2019t on the next one. A man who lived with his mom in Massachusetts\nwas challenging the government\u2019s search of his storage locker in\nArizona. His lawyer sparred with the judges for some time about the\ndetails of Fourth Amendment law. Then the government\u2019s lawyer took the\nstage. \u201cLet me tell you about this man,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a condition of his\nparole, he wasn\u2019t permitted to have any guns. But he kept one gun, the\nmachine gun he\u2019d had since he was a kid \u2014 he called it his baby. The\ngovernment got a tip and showed up on his doorstep and he practically\nhanded them the gun and then told them to go away. It was raining\noutside and he wouldn\u2019t let them into his house. They searched the house\nand found another machine gun kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Court, he was asked if he had any more guns. His lawyer, acting on\nhis client\u2019s behalf, insisted that the Court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction\nbecause all the other guns were in a storage locker in Arizona. After\nthe lawyer said that, we had to search the locker in Arizona. There we\nfound a huge shipping crate. To take the crate into evidence, the\ngovernment had to inventory it. There we found 44 flamethrowers, 22\nsubmachine guns, 5 hand grenades, and a handful of pistols. We had to\ncall in the bomb squad and check over everything. And he\u2019s arguing that\nthe Fourth Amendment doesn\u2019t permit us to open that crate.\u201d\n\nLater, I heard some of the lawyers on a different case joking. \u201cOnce\nopposing counsel says flamethrowers, you\u2019ve lost. Doesn\u2019t matter how\ngood your case is. You\u2019re never going to recover from that.\u201d\n\nIt was into this environment that Larry Lessig stepped. Lessig has been\nthinking about the implications of copyright law for most of his career.\nHe has spent months practicing to argue before the Supreme Court and\nother lesser courts. He spent the weekend practicing this case with\nother faculty members at the Stanford Law School. He spent the morning\npacing the halls, going over his notes one last time. And as he strode\ninto the Courtroom that morning and begun his argument before the Court,\nunlike every other lawyer who had presented, he didn\u2019t stumble over a\nsingle word.\n\nIn some ways, this should have been home territory for Lessig. It was\nhis own Court, right in his own town of San Francisco. And as he paced\nthe halls, he was continually interrupted by former students of his at\nStanford Law, who had gone on to careers as lawyers in the area, which\nhad brought them here, to argue before the Court just like him. And,\nperhaps he figured, the judges would welcome a break from the endless\nparade of petty complaints to his arguments about the big issues \u2014 the\nFirst Amendment, the Progress clause, copyright. Weren\u2019t things like\nthat why they became judges in the first place?\n\nPerhaps not.\n\n*[continued in part 2](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kahlereport2)*\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1164614400.0, "postid": "kahlereport", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kahlereport2"]}, "policyprimer": {"post_title": "How Policy Gets Made: A Primer", "tags": [], "post_content": "How Policy Gets Made: A Primer\n==============================\n\nMay 17, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/policyprimer)\n\n* * * * *\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s campaign was a model of efficiency and foresightedness.\nBill Clinton treated his campaign plans like marketing documents,\npoll-testing each proposed new idea, and forcing his administration to\nonly begin seriously thinking about what to do once they were in office.\nObama, by contrast, started early and put together a series of policy\nteams even before the campaign had begun in earnest.\n\nEach policy team had a different subject \u2014 technology, health care,\nforeign policy \u2014 and was led by a top ally or fundraiser in the field.\nLet\u2019s take technology, since it\u2019s the case I\u2019m most familiar with.\nJulius Genachowski was named Chairman of the Technology, Media and\nTelecommunications policy working group. Genachowski was a Harvard Law\nSchool classmate of Obama\u2019s who had gone on to become a chief executive\nat Barry Diller\u2019s IAC/InterActiveCorp (market cap: \\$2.1 billion). He\nwent on to become a venture capitalist and sit on the board of numerous\ntechnology companies.\n\nHe used his wealth ([annual\nincome](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/04/01/fcc-nominee-to-take-a-big-paycut/):\n\\$1.6 million) and influence to become the leading Silicon Valley\nfundraiser for his old classmate \u2014 indeed, one of Obama\u2019s top\nfundraisers nationally. As a result, he was the obvious pick to define\nObama\u2019s technology policy. Genachowski canvassed his fellow Silicon\nValley business leaders for policy suggestions and his team synthesized\nthe results into proposed policy documents. These proposals were\ncirculated among a wider circle for further comments before being\npublished on the campaign website.\n\nAfter the election was won, the teams were reassembled as transition\nteams. Genachowski was again leading the technology team, now named the\nTechnology, Innovation & Government Reform Policy Working Group (TIGR).\nIt was staffed by old government hands, like Thomas Kalil (Deputy\nAssistant to President Clinton for Technology and Economic Policy, rode\nout the Bush years as Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Science\nand Technology at UC Berkeley). Also brought out were business leaders,\nlike Andrew McLaughlin (Head of Global Public Policy and Government\nAffairs for Google), and business-affiliated academic experts, like\nSusan Crawford (UMich law professor and a former partner at a DC law\nfirm).\n\nThe teams worked on converting the policy documents from the campaign\ninto instructions that would be given to federal agencies or executive\norders the President could sign. They fleshed out campaign proposals,\ninterviewed potential candidates for government positions, and held\naudiences with various interest groups. I visited DC during this period\nand got to see the aforementioned names at DC cocktail parties or the\ndiner outside transition headquarters that became the informal\nmeeting-place of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked in my\nlife,\u201d Susan Crawford told me, clearly relishing the challenge.\n\nAfter the inauguration, the teams disbanded and their members either\nreturned to private life or were named to the administration.\nGenachowski, who obviously had his pick of positions, was named chairman\nof the Federal Communications Commission. Thomas Kalil became Associate\nDirector of Science and Technology Policy. Susan Crawford became Special\nAssistant to the President for Science, Technology, and Innovation\nPolicy. McLaughlin went back to work at Google, where his connections to\nthe new administration are no doubt invaluable.\n\n**UPDATE:** [McLaughlin was named Deptuy\nCTO](http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217700899)\n", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/04/01/fcc-nominee-to-take-a-big-paycut/", "http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217700899"], "time": 1242543600.0, "postid": "policyprimer", "internal_links": []}, "knowkeynes": {"post_title": "You Don\u2019t Know John (Maynard Keynes)", "tags": [], "post_content": "You Don\u2019t Know John (Maynard Keynes)\n====================================\n\nJuly 27, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/knowkeynes)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFrom the right, [Gary Becker\nwrites](http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2009/11/how-to-increase-employment--becker.html):\n\n> Keynes and many earlier economists emphasized that unemployment rises\n> during recessions because nominal wage rates tend to be inflexible in\n> the downward direction.\n\nFrom the left, [Matt Yglesias\nwrites](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/stimulus-and-the-welfare-state/):\n\n> \u2026the Keynesian prescription is not only for the government to run\n> deficits in response to recessions, but to run surpluses in\n> expansions. Thus, the Clinton administration\u2019s fiscal policies were\n> arguably \u201cKeynesian\u201d but the Reagan and (especially) George W Bush\n> administrations were implementing an agenda that flew in the face of\n> Keynes\u2019 ideas much more clearly than anything Angela Merkel\u2019s ever\n> done.\n\nNeither of these are true at all. Pretty much the very first thing\nKeynes says in the general theory is that downwardly-inflexible nominal\nwage rates (sticky wages) are a *good* thing. And he spends a large part\nof chapter 8 denouncing the practice of saving surpluses (sinking\nfunds).\n\nSo where do they get this stuff? While these aren\u2019t the views of Keynes,\nboth these views are held by the so-called \u201cNew Keynesians\u201d \u2014 people\nlike Paul Krugman and Greg Mankiw, who have tried to shoehorn a moderate\nversion of Keynes into classical economics. These proponents are rather\nmore prominent than more traditional Keynesians like Jamie Galbraith, so\npolitical commentators hear their view and assume it\u2019s a faithful\nrepresentation of Keynes\u2019 own.\n\nPerhaps Keynes was wrong \u2014 after all, we shouldn\u2019t slavishly follow the\nscribblings of some defunct economist. But if so, we should tell the\ntruth and admit we\u2019re disagreeing with Keynes, not expounding his ideas.\n(Both Yglesias and Becker have not run a correction, despite my emails.)\nFurthermore, we should actually engage with Keynes\u2019 argument.\n\nOn sticky wages, Keynes says that if nominal wages could fall, then\nnominal costs would fall, which would mean that nominal prices would\nfall, which means that real wages would end up staying the\nsame.^[1](#fn:q1)^ But, even worse, if there was no stickiness at all,\nnothing would stop nominal wages from falling further and further until\neventually everyone was paid zero.^[2](#fn:q2)^ I have never heard the\nNew Keynesians respond to this argument.\n\nOn the question of surpluses, Keynes criticizes them as a pointless\nreduction of aggregate demand. They create unemployment because they\ntake money out of circulation for no real purpose. It\u2019s just supposed to\nsit around until a \u201crainy day\u201d when the economy isn\u2019t doing so well. But\nwhen that rainy day comes, the reason the economy isn\u2019t doing well is\nbecause people are out of work. If that\u2019s true, you can simply print\nmore money to get them back to work without any ill effects. (Printing\nmoney only causes inflation at full employment.) You don\u2019t get any\nbenefit from having taken the money out of circulation\nearlier.^[3](#fn:q3)^\n\nBoth these seem like strong arguments to me. Perhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s\neasier to pretend they don\u2019t exist.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

J. Bernstein is the greatest\nprogrammer in the history of the world.\n\nFirst, look only at the objective facts. djb has written two major\npieces of system software: a mail server and a DNS server. Both are run\nby millions of Internet domains. They accomplish all sorts of\ncomplicated functions, work under incredibly high loads, and confront no\nend of unusual situations. And they both run pretty much exactly has\nBernstein first wrote them. One bug \u2014 one bug! \u2014 was found in qmail. A\nsecond bug was recently found in djbdns, but you can get a sense of how\nimportant it is by the fact that it took people nearly a decade to find\nit.\n\nNo other programmer has this kind of track record. Donald Knuth probably\ncomes closest, but his diary about writing TeX (printed in *[Literate\nProgramming](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0937073806)*) shows how he kept\nfinding bugs for years and never expected to be finished, only to get\ncloser and closer (thus the odd version numbering scheme). Not only does\nno one else have djb\u2019s track record, no one else even comes close.\n\nBut far more important are the subjective factors. djb\u2019s programs are\nsome of the greatest works of beauty to be comprehended by the human\nmind. As with great art, the outline of the code is somehow visually\npleasing \u2014 there is balance and rhythm and meter that rivals even the\nbest typography. As with great poetry, every character counts \u2014 every\nsingle one is there because it needs to be. But these programs are not\njust for being seen or read \u2014 like a graceful dancer, they move! And not\njust as a single dancer either, but a whole choreographed number \u2014\nprocesses splitting and moving and recombining at great speeds, around\nand around again.\n\nBut, unlike a dance, this movement has a purpose. They accomplish things\nthat need accomplishing \u2014 they find your websites, they ferry your email\nfrom place to place. In the most fantastic movies, the routing and\nsorting of the post office is imagined as a giant endless choreographed\ndance number. (Imagine, perhaps, \u201cThe Office\u201d from *Brazil*.) But this\nis no one-time fantasy, this is how your email gets sorted *every day*.\n\nAnd the dance is not just there to please human eyes \u2014 it is a dance\nwith a purpose. Each of its inner mechanisms is perfectly crafted, using\nthe fewest number of moving parts, accomplishing its task with the most\nminimal energy. The way jobs are divided and assigned is nothing short\nof brilliant. The brilliance is not merely linguistic, although it is\nthat too, but contains a kind of elegant mathematical effectiveness,\nbacked by a stream of numbers and equations that show, through pure\nreason alone, that the movements are provably perfect, a better solution\nis guaranteed not to exist.\n\nBut even all this does not capture his software\u2019s incredible beauty. For\ndjb\u2019s programs are not great machines to be admired from a distance,\nvast powerhouses of elegant accomplishment. They are also tools meant to\nbe used by man, perfectly fitted to one\u2019s hand. Like a great piece of\nindustrial design, they bring joy to the user every time they are used.\n\nWhat other field combines all these arts? Language, math, art, design,\nfunction. Programming is clearly in a class of its own. And, when it\ncomes to programmers, who even competes with djb? Who else has worked to\nrealize these amazing possibilities? Who else even knows they are there?\n\nOddly, there are many people who profess to hate djb. Some of this is\njust the general distaste of genius: djb clearly has a forceful,\nuncompromising vision, which many misinterpret as arrogance and\nrudeness. And some of it is the practical man\u2019s disregard for great\ndesign: djb\u2019s programs do not work like most programs, for the simple\nreason that the way most programs work is wrong. But the animosity goes\nmuch deeper than that. I do not profess to understand it, but I do\nhonestly suspect at some level it\u2019s people without taste angry and\nfrustrated at the plaudits showered on what they cannot see. Great art\nalways generates its share of mocking detractors.\n\nThis is not to say that djb\u2019s work is perfect. There are the bugs, as\nmentioned before, and the log files, which are nothing if not inelegant,\nand no doubt djb would make numerous changes were he to write the\nsoftware again today. But who else is even trying? Who else even knows\nthis is possible? I did not realize what great art in software could be\nuntil I read djb. And now I feel dirty reading anything else.\n\n*More:* You may also be interested in [what djb is doing\nnow](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001502).\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0937073806"], "time": 1255935600.0, "postid": "djb", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/djb.ja", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001502"]}, "conclar": {"post_title": "Consciousness Clarified", "tags": [], "post_content": "Consciousness Clarified\n=======================\n\nAugust 1, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/conclar)\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou ever notice how when you learn a new word you begin seeing it used\neverywhere? Lately I\u2019ve been feeling that way about consciousness. I\nknew the word before, obviously, but lately I\u2019ve clarified my thoughts\nabout what it *is* and sloppy usage of the term sticks out like a sore\nthumb.\n\n\u201cConsciousness\u201d, the dictionary kindly explains, is \u201cthe state or\ncondition of being conscious.\u201d And we all basically know what it means\nto be conscious. You poke someone awake and ask \u201cAre you conscious?\u201d You\nget hit on the head by a large rock and you get knocked unconscious.\nBeing conscious, in short, means being awake, being aware of your\nsurroundings, seeing colors and feeling pinches and hearing songs.\n\nNow there\u2019s something weird about being conscious \u2014 something so weird,\nin fact, that I\u2019ve found many people are bizarrely tempted to deny it.\nConsciousness is what the philosopher John Searle calls \u201contologically\nsubjective\u201d. That is, when you see the color red, while it\u2019s true that\nall sorts of complicated things happen in your eyes and brains, a\nparticular experience \u2014 the one we call \u201cseeing red\u201d \u2014 happens only to\nyou. If aliens with the most powerful viewing technology possible beamed\ndown to earth and peeked inside your brain, they\u2019d still have no idea\nwhat the color red looked like. They\u2019d see that a certain wavelength of\nlight triggered certain electrical impulses in certain centers, but\nthey\u2019d never see *red*. It\u2019s just not there.\n\nNow we don\u2019t know for sure what *causes* consciousness (it\u2019s an ongoing\nresearch project) but whatever the answer is, it must be caused by\n*something*. Yet this obvious fact is continually missed by laypeople\nwho make bizarre comments like \u201cas soon as computers become self-aware,\nthey might become conscious\u201d.^[1](#fn:fn1)^ This is as absurd as saying\nthat as soon as computers are told about food, they might start\ndigesting things.\n\nConsciousness isn\u2019t some vague property of things that look smart to us.\nIt has a real, physical meaning: feeling things. I suppose it\u2019s\nlogically possible that a talking robot might start feeling things, but\nthe chances seem awfully remote.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

The point, so eloquently defended\nin his book *Code, and Other Laws of Cyberspace*, is that in the worlds\ncreated by software, the design of the software regulates behavior just\nas strongly as any formal law does; more effectively, in fact.\n\nThe point is obvious in some contexts. In the online 3D universe of\nSecond Life, if the software prevents you from typing a certain word,\nthat\u2019s a far more effective restraint on speech in that world than any\nUS law could ever be in ours. But the point is far more subtle than\nthat; it applies with equal force to the world of Wikipedia, the\nthriving community and culture that our wiki software creates.\n\nFor one thing, the software decides who gets to be part of the\ncommunity. If using it is clear and simple, then lots of people can use\nit. But, if it\u2019s complicated, then only those who take the time to learn\nit are able to take part. And, as we\u2019ve seen, lots of intelligent people\ndon\u2019t even understand how to edit Wikipedia, let alone do any of the\nother things on the site.\n\nFor another, the software decides how the community operates. Features\nlike administrative controls privilege some users over others. Support\nfor things like stable revisions decide what sorts of things get\npublished. The structure of talk pages help decide what and how things\nget discussed.\n\nThe page design the site uses encourages specific actions by making some\nlinks clear and prominent. Software functions like categories make\ncertain kinds of features possible. The formatting codes used for things\nlike infoboxes and links determine how easy it is for newcomers to edit\nthose pieces of the site.\n\nAll of these things are political choices, not technical ones. It\u2019s not\nlike there\u2019s a right answer that\u2019s obvious to any intelligent\nprogrammer. And these choices can have huge effects on the community.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s essential the community be involved in making these\ndecisions.\n\nThe current team of Wikipedia programmers is a volunteer group (although\na couple of them were recently hired by the Wikimedia Foundation so they\ncould live a little more comfortably) working much like a standard free\nsoftware community, discussing things on mailing lists and IRC channels.\nThey got together in person in the days before Wikimania to discuss some\nof the current hot topics in the software.\n\nOne presentation was by a usability expert who told us about a study\ndone on how hard people found it to add a photo to a Wikipedia page. The\ndiscussion after the presentation turned into a debate over *whether*\nWikipedia should be easy to to use. Some suggested that confused users\nshould just add their contributions in the wrong way and a more\nexperienced users would come along to clean their contributions up.\nOthers questioned whether confused users should be allowed to edit the\nsite at all \u2014 [were their contributions even\nvaluable?](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)\n\nAs a programmer, I have a great deal of respect for the members of my\ntrade. But with all due respect, are these really decisions that the\nprogrammers should be making?\n\nMeanwhile, Jimbo Wales also has a for-profit company, Wikia, which\nrecently received \\$4 million in venture capital funding. Wales has\nsaid, including in his keynote speech at Wikimania, that one of the\nthings he hopes to spend it on is hiring programmers to improve the\nWikipedia software.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that seems like a thoughtful gesture if you\nthink of the software as neutral \u2014 after all, improvements are\nimprovements \u2014 but becomes rather more problematic if technical choices\nhave political effects. Should executives and venture capitalists be\ncalling the shots on some of these issues?\n\nThe Wikipedia community is enormously vibrant and I have no doubt that\nthe site will manage to survive many software changes. But if we\u2019re\nconcerned about more than mere survival, about how to make Wikipedia the\nbest that it can be, we need to start thinking about software design as\nmuch as we think about the rest of our policy choices.\n", "external_links": ["mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election"], "time": 1158562800.0, "postid": "wikicodeislaw", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia"]}, "insidege": {"post_title": "Inside GE", "tags": [], "post_content": "Inside GE\n=========\n\nNovember 19, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/insidege)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor the past six months or so, I\u2019ve been working on getting data out of\ngovernment in various ways.

Many have challenged this view, from a variety of\nperspectives, but Tom Slee (who calls this notion MarketThink) has\nchosen to focus on just one: the economic subfield of \u201cgame theory\u201d.\n\nIn his elegant little book, the poorly-titled *No One Makes You Shop At\nWal-Mart*, Slee walks through the major discoveries of game theory,\nexplains them in simple language with reference to a fictional town of\nWhimsley, and discusses how they refute standard economic conclusions\nwhile still playing by basic economic assumptions with effects that\nappear to show up in the real world.\n\nTake the problem of littering, for example. The town of Whimsley has a\nlarge park between its coffee shop and its office building. Residents\ncan toss their empty coffee cups on the ground in the park, thereby\nsaving themselves the trouble of carrying it but minutely spoiling the\npark, or they can carry it to the trash at the office, saving the park\nbut bothering their hands. In the absence of anyone else, each resident\nis better off tossing their cup \u2014 the bother of carrying it is much more\nthan the small amount of spoilage. But if everyone does this, the park\nis quickly full of litter. Each individual, acting perfectly rationally,\ncreates a situation that none of them want.\n\nA similar problem gives the book its title. Imagine you get some utility\nfrom having a vibrant downtown of independent shops. Then a Wal-Mart\nopens up on the outskirts of town. You begin shopping at the Wal-Mart\nbecause the prices are cheaper and you can still walk through the\nvibrant downtown when you like. But with everyone buying things at\nWal-Mart, the downtown stores can no longer afford to stay open and the\ncenter of your city turns into an empty husk. You\u2019d prefer to have the\nvibrant downtown to the Wal-Mart, but nobody ever gave you that choice.\n\nThe book is full of dozens of examples like this, each with careful\nanalysis and clear writing. Perhaps the most odd feature of the book is\nits politics. On the one hand, Slee is plainly a committed leftist, with\npositive references to Naomi Klein and other capitalist critics. But on\nthe other hand, he never gives up on the rational actor and\nmethodological individualist assumptions of modern economics, and shows\nlittle patience for those (typically his political allies) who have more\nthorough-going critiques. Nonetheless, the book is a recommended read\nfor anyone interested in these questions.\n\n**Online Bonus:** Watch Tom Slee [eviscerate Chris Anderson\u2019s\ninbox-stuffer, *The Long\nTail*](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2007/03/the_long_tail_l.html)\non his weblog, Whimsley.

And while there\nwere lawyers and suits and conference tables and papers to sign (oh,\nplenty of papers to sign), it wasn\u2019t really like that. It was more just\na couple guys in a apartment typing on computers and talking on the\nphone.\n\nI remember how when reddit started, the whole thing seemed so childish.\nThe cartoony alien, the barebones design, the fresh-faced programmers,\nthe rented house. And none of that has really changed. It\u2019s just that\nwith success behind it, it\u2019s harder to dismiss. A scribbled drawing a\nkid hands to you is \u201ccute\u201d, the same thing on the wall of a museum is\n\u201cart\u201d. You assume there must be something there, even if you can\u2019t see\nit.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to notice this when you\u2019re in the middle of it. During the\ndays, I mostly saw my co-workers, who lived and breathed the site. At\nnight, I hung out with my friends, who all knew what I did. On weekends,\nwe\u2019d go to parties for local startups, who all wanted to emulate\nreddit\u2019s success. Everyone we talked to treated us like it was serious.\n\nBut whenever I stepped outside the bubble, things were very different.\nAt non-tech parties, I\u2019d have trouble explaining what it was I did. (\u201cSo\nyou, uh, have a web site?\u201d) Once I went far outside the city to have\nlunch with an author I respected. He asked about what I did, wanted me\nto explain it in great detail. He asked how many visitors we had. I told\nhim and he sputtered. \u201cI\u2019ve spent fifteen years building an audience,\nand you\u2019re telling me in a year you have a million visitors?\u201d I\nassented.\n\nPuzzled, he insisted I show him the site on his own computer, but he\nfound it was just a simple as I described. (Simpler, even.) \u201cSo it\u2019s\njust a list of links?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even write them\nyourselves?\u201d I nodded. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing to it!\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhy is\nit so popular?\u201d\n\nInside the bubble, nobody asks this inconvenient question. We just\nmumble things like \u201cdemocratic news\u201d or \u201csocial bookmarking\u201d and\neverybody just assumes it all makes sense. But looking at this guy, I\nrealized I had no actual justification. It was just a list of links. And\nwe didn\u2019t even write them ourselves.\n\nBut that\u2019s not something you can say on TechCrunch. You can say a site\nis cool, stupid, popular, a flop, innovative, or clich\u00e9d. But the one\nthing you can\u2019t say, the one thing that everybody skips over, is that\nthese sites aren\u2019t anything serious.

Once you start a machine,\nif no one touches it, its behavior can be predicted entirely in advance\nfrom the laws of physics. When you drop a pen down a well, it is\nphysically necessary that it fall.\n\nBut our behavior doesn\u2019t feel that way. When we stick out our tongue it\nfeels as if we had to specifically choose to stick it out, that this was\nour own action and not a predetermined consequence of the existing state\nof the world.\n\nSome people argue that because the evidence for determinism is so\noverwhelming, free will must simply be an illusion. But if so, it is a\nvery odd kind of illusion. Most illusions result from a naive\ninterpretation of our senses. For example, in a classic illusion, two\ndrawings of equal size appear to be of different size. But when we are\ntold this is an illusion, we can correct for it, and behave under the\nnew (more accurate) impression that the drawings are in fact of equal\nsize.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t possible with free will. If someone tells you that you\ndo not actually have free will but have actually been acting under an\nillusion, you cannot sit back and let determinism take over. When the\nwaiter asks you whether you like soup or salad, you cannot say \u201cOh, well\nI\u2019ve just learned that free will is an illusion and all my actions are\ncompletely determined by the previous state of the world, so I\u2019ll just\nlet them play themselves out.\u201d I mean, you can say that, but the waiter\nwill look at you like you\u2019re crazy and you will get neither soup nor\nsalad.\n\nIt seems overwhelmingly bizarre that evolution would have given us this\nstrangest of illusions. This is not a spandrel, a small place evolution\nnever had time to be concerned about. The illusion of free will affects\nall aspects of our lives and takes an enormous amount of work. One would\nthink evolution would have eliminated it were it genuinely false.\n\nSo what is the other possibility? The other possibility is that not all\nactions are entirely determined by the preexisting state of the world.\nAnd, in fact, recent advances in physics seem to show this is somewhat\nthe case. Quantum mechanics suggests that at some fundamental level\nthere is randomness involved in the laws of the world. And chaos theory\nshows us that small amounts of randomness in a system can have real\nlarge-scale effects.\n\nSo, although it seems extremely improbable, if we have to avoid the\nimprobability of evolution not breeding out an illusory free will, then\nwe\u2019re forced to look to the randomness of quantum mechanics for an\nexplanation.\n\nBut, some argue, this is insufficient. Quantum mechanics only gives us\nrandomness \u2014 but free will isn\u2019t just the pursuit of random behavior,\nit\u2019s the pursuit of particular behaviors. While quantum mechanics can\u2019t\npredict each individual bit, it does give overall probability\ndistributions. Volitional behaviors would wreak havoc with those even\ndistributions.\n\nNot true. Imagine the simple case where we have one quantum bitstream: a\nseries of zeroes and ones, in which each individual number cannot be\npredicted, but there\u2019s an overall law saying that roughly half of them\nwill be one and half will be zero. And let us simplify the system to say\nthat if the result of the quantum effect is 0 then the person moves\nleft, and if it\u2019s 1 they move right. In the naive scenario, free will\naffects this quantum bitstream so that when the person wants to move\nleft the randomness keeps coming up zeroes. But that would violate the\nlaws of physics \u2014 the results would no longer be half ones and half\nzeroes.\n\nSo here\u2019s the trick: first, the system gets a random bit from some other\nsource. Then it adds the bit from the other source with the bit from the\nquantum bitstream and uses the result to decide if you move left or\nright. Now, when you want to continually move left, half the time you\u2019ll\nhave to make the quantum bitstream return zeroes and the other half the\ntime ones \u2014 exactly what the laws of quantum mechanics require.\n\nWith a little additional mathematical complexity, the scenario is\ngeneralizable to much more complicated quantum functions and human\nresults. But the basic principle is the same: one can use quantum\nrandomness to exercise free will without violating any statistical laws.\n\nOf course, this still leaves one key problem. What is picking the\nresults of this quantum bitstream? And how does it do it? I have to\nadmit I cannot really think of a sensible way. But this seems like a\nproblem for neurobiology to figure out and report back to us. I merely\naim to prove that its doing so is consistent with what we know about the\nlaws of physics.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1174201200.0, "postid": "quantumwill", "internal_links": []}, "forgottensidekick": {"post_title": "The Forgotten Sidekick", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Forgotten Sidekick\n======================\n\nDecember 11, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/forgottensidekick)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s been a frustrating year for us Sidekick users. It seems like every\ntelevision show, periodical, and man in the street is raving about the\namazing world-changing capabilities of the iPhone (and, to a lesser\nextent, the Google Phone). How having a device that can conveniently\nsurf the Web, answer email, run third-party applications and fit in your\npocket is [as big a technological breakthrough as\nhovercars](http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/iphone_3g).\n\nWhich is infuriating to those of us who have been using a superior\ndevice for the past five years.\n\nFrom the very first demo of the iPhone, it was obvious it was a knockoff\nof the Sidekick. The UI demo Steve Jobs did \u2014 calling two people and\nthen merging the calls \u2014 is the exact same demo I\u2019d given to all my\nfriends to show off the incredible UI polish and attention to detail by\nthe Sidekick developers. Sure, there were some differences \u2014 most\nnotably that Apple\u2019s artists had prettied up the iPhone UI as compared\nto the 8-bit basement wackos who drew up the Sidekick\u2019s \u2014 but it was\nclear that this was an evolutionary change, not the revolutionary leap\neveryone made it out to be.\n\nAnd, when I bought an iPhone, it became clear it wasn\u2019t even an\nimprovement. The touch-keyboard made it impossible to type anything at\nlength (I regularly composed whole articles on my Sidekick), the lack of\nmultitasking made it impossible to queue up articles in the Web browser\nand read them on the subway (I read several books on the Sidekick),\ninstant messages weren\u2019t even supported, and the swipe-to-scroll method\nquickly grew tiresome. Within a couple weeks, I sold the phone to a\nfriend (although not before getting an outrageous roaming bill from AT&T\nbecause the iPhone couldn\u2019t keep its mouth shut).\n\nFor those two weeks, though, I was repeatedly stopped and gawked at by\nwell-dressed people in airports and trains. They all wanted to know \u201cIs\nthat the iPhone?\u201d and \u201cHow is it?\u201d By contrast, those people, when they\nsaw me using the Sidekick, assumed it was a videogame device.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as if the Sidekick was unheard of. As soon as I wandered\nout of the land of white folks in suits-and-ties, black and latino kids\nwould rush up to me and gab about the Sidekick. During one trip, a\nlatina middle-schooler stopped me on the sidewalk and asked if I\u2019d\ngotten the latest firmware update yet. \u201cIt has JavaScript support!\u201d she\nenthused. Browsing the Sidekick user forums bore this out \u2014 it was all\nblack and latino schoolchildren.\n\nBut, of course, neither minorities nor schoolchildren rule the world, so\nthe Sidekick has been written out of history. 2007 was the first time\nanyone had thought to give a smartphone a decent UI, or a web browser,\nor an over-the-air application store.

I get a special kind of joy out of tweaking every last\ndetail until it\u2019s just right, making sure each pixel is in its place.\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve never really been able to indulge this desire on any\nof my previous projects, either because my skills are too weak (no\nmatter how much time I spend on it, I\u2019ll never be able to craft a page\nlike [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) can) or because time is\ntoo short.\n\nAt Reddit, for example, we were always rushing-rushing-rushing to get\nmore done. In [a recent post](http://paulgraham.com/die.html), Paul\nGraham suggests startups can make you rich if you simply make sure to\nemail him once a week. At Reddit we had no such worries: Paul was sure\nto email us weekly, sometimes even daily, usually asking why we hadn\u2019t\nadded any new features to the site lately. (In fairness, it worked, I\nsuppose.)\n\nWhen you get that question once a week, you get to try out many\ndifferent answers, including questioning the premise. At first I give\nthe usual low-level excuses: we weren\u2019t feeling well this week, we had\nto go to a meeting, Alexis was out of town. Then we started in on more\ngeneral principles: afraid of change, distracted by day-to-day fires,\ndissatisfaction with the codebase. And once I sent him [*Slate*\u2019s\nsuggestion that](http://www.slate.com/id/2141797) \u201cthe Eccentrics\u2019 own\negotistical indolence has resulted in self-imposed limits to their\nskills\u2014at the very least it deprives the world of more of their unique\ncultural prognostications.\u201d (He was not amused.)\n\nPaul eventually became convinced that we had written lots of good code\nbut wouldn\u2019t release it because we were perfectionists. *Knock it off*,\nhe would tell us. *It\u2019s more important to get it up than to get it\nright.* Paul had become convinced that users love seeing new features,\nit gave them the impression of an exciting vibrant site.\n\nThere is something to this, of course. But I have a contrary proposal:\nusers love perfectionism. Creating something brilliant is a process of\ncontinual refinement: adding bits where they\u2019re needed, chipping off\nothers that aren\u2019t, and sanding everything smooth once it\u2019s in place,\nthen polishing it until it gleams. Do one thing, release it, and don\u2019t\nstop releasing improvements until you do it really, really, well.\n\nAdding features is part of this, of course, but not at all the whole\nthing. You can\u2019t create a great sculpture just by tossing on more and\nmore clay.\n\nMeanwhile, even if users can\u2019t immediately see all the subtle details\nyou\u2019ve added, they begin to add up to a feeling of \u2014 if you\u2019re talented\n\u2014 delight.

People in Los Angeles want fame. People\nin DC want power. People in Miami want to have fun. But what do people\nin San Francisco want?\n\nIt\u2019s not money. Sure, a startup that sells for a lot of money is nice,\nbut it\u2019s clearly not the goal. I think few startup founders would feel\ngood about building something worthless and then tricking a big company\ninto buying it for a lot of money.\n\nIt\u2019s not fame. Sure, Mark Zuckerberg is famous now, but he actually\nseems more annoyed about that than anything.\n\nIt\u2019s not power, or else the founders of GitHub would look ridiculous for\ngiving all their power away to their employees. Paul Buchheit didn\u2019t\nwrite Gmail because he wanted to control the actions of its users.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not having fun. (Although, like most hard things,\nstartups are actually surprisingly fun.)\n\nNo, I think the thing startup founders want is *importance*.\n\nImportance is a bit like power, but heavily diluted. Power is about\nbeing able to make people do something they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do. The\nInstagram founders weren\u2019t in it for power: they have very little\ninterest in making people take photos they wouldn\u2019t otherwise take. But\nnonetheless, their decisions had a great deal of importance for their\nusers. If they decided to put ads in their app or remove a favorite\nfilter, millions of people\u2019s lives suddenly get a little bit more\nannoying.\n\nBecause your tiny decisions have huge impacts on people, when you\u2019re\nimportant everyone wants to hear what you have to say. You can go to TED\nand WEF and the audience wants to come up to talk to you, not so much\nbecause they want something from you, but because what you think has a\nbig impact on their lives.\n\nThis is why selling a startup is so hard. It gets you money and fame but\nit means losing a lot of your importance. Now when you go to TED, you\u2019re\na has-been; you just answer questions about what the good old days are\nlike.\n\nImportance is different from impact. Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the\nWeb) had a huge impact in the world, but he\u2019s not particularly\nimportant. He decided long ago that the Semantic Web was the next big\nthing, but few people cared, because practically there was very little\nhe could actually do about it.\n\nDick Costolo (CEO of Twitter), by contrast, is pretty important. If he\ndecides that Twitter needs a \u201cconsistent user experience\u201d, he can shut\ndown apps millions of people use each day, destroying the companies that\nbuild them.\n\nWe all know the dangers of wanting money or power. But the dangers of\nwanting importance are little-discussed. Importance tends to require\ncentralizing things, which means restraining innovation and leaving\nyourself open to the demands of actual power.\n\nImagine Tim had built the Web the same way folks built Twitter. All our\nweb pages would be would be hosted by a single company, accessed through\nan API that they defined and could change at whim. Web applications\nwould be far weaker than they are today (since it would be hard to store\nanything interesting on TimCo\u2019s servers) and powerful corporations would\nconstantly be knocking people offline permanently for various\nterms-of-service violations (no trademark infringement! no hate\nspeech!).\n\nTim would be much more important in this world, but I don\u2019t think the\nrest of us would be better off.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.yamdas.org/column/technique/sfwantsj.html"], "time": 1344150000.0, "postid": "sfwants", "internal_links": []}, "stockholm": {"post_title": "Stockholm", "tags": ["tech and society", "copyright"], "post_content": "Stockholm\n=========\n\nJanuary 31, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/stockholm)\n\n* * * * *\n\nVisit Sweden\u2019s National Gallery and you\u2019ll see grand murals, elegant\nsculpture, classical paintings.

Chandler,\nJr.*\n\nPart 1\n------\n\nIt\u2019s difficult today to imagine what American companies were like before\nthe 1840s. They were small concerns, owned and operated by the same\nperson in one location, and focusing on a particular type of product\n(cotton, provisions, wheat, dry goods, hardware, drugs) and one piece of\nthe distribution chain (retailing, wholesaling, importing, exporting).\nTheir corporate structure (the partnership), accounting techniques\n(double-entry bookkeeping), and financial instruments (letters of\ncredit) were essentially unchanged from those used by the Italians in\nthe 1390s.\n\nBigger projects were pursued through personal relationships between\nsmall firms: family farms had their slaves grow crops, which they sold\nto the local merchant, who shipped it to his son or nephew in London,\nwho sold it to the local merchants there, and thence to the customers.\n(At the same time, credit headed the other direction.) As time went on,\nthe number of intermediaries only increased: factors and jobbers and\nbrokers and dealers and commission agents. Coordination was handled\nthrough the market.\n\n(The one exception was the Bank of the United States, which had branches\nin many locations and thus could coordinate on something of a national\nscale. But it was politically unpopular and both the First and Second\nbanks were allowed to expire by Congress.)\n\nThere was incredible inefficiency, but it mattered little since the\ntechnology of the time did not allow for great speed or volume. Canal\nboats were still pulled by animals, for whom four miles an hour was an\nimpressive speed, and most products (clothing, furniture, clocks, nails)\nwere produced by hand in people\u2019s homes through the \u201cputting-out\u201d\nsystem. There were a handful of textile factories, but since they\ndepended on water-power there was only room for a few of them.\n\nPart 2\n------\n\nAll this changed with the railroads, a technological improvement which\nallowed business to move their products vastly faster. Careful\ncoordination was essential (one didn\u2019t want trains crashing into each\nother), market entry expensive (constructing a railroad line cost a\ngreat deal of money), and network effects powerful (a railroad was much\nmore valuable if it could move things all the way across the country).\n\nAs a result, the railroads built big enterprises, with professional\nmanagers to operate them. The businesses were the first to be structured\nalong largely modern lines (the line-and-staff system): a board of\ndirectors appointed a professional manager as president, who oversaw a\nseries of vice presidents supervising various company-wide topics\n(finance, traffic, legal) as well as a general manager. The general\nmanager oversaw a number of divisions, each with departmental managers\nwith profit and loss responsibility and a staff of their own. Each\ndepartment sent statistics back to headquarters, allowing senior\nmanagement to improve overall efficiency.\n\nIn addition to consolidating various different roles into a single\norganization, the railroads consolidated different organizations into a\ncartel with a few large players who coordinated pricing schemes and\nextracted the maximum each merchant was able to pay. The quintessential\nplayer in this era of empire-building was the speculator Jay Gould and\nhis nemesis Cornelius Vanderbilt.\n\nGould got his start in 1868 when Vanderbilt attempted to seize control\nof the Erie railroad, the nearest competitor to his New York Central.\nGould succeeded in stopping him and became the Erie\u2019s largest\nstockholder and president. He then leased two additional lines and\npurchased shareholder proxies for two more lines, which he used to vote\nnew directors into power, who then agreed to sell the lines to the Erie.\n(The courts and legislature quickly moved to stop him and the\nPennsylvania seized control of the lines.) He merged with additional\nlines in Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan, before attempting to corner the\nmarket on gold, leading to a stock market crash. The crash forced other\nlines to sell, but Vanderbilt had more funds and bought them up.\n\nGould had more success in the telegraph industry, where consolidation\ncame even more rapidly. Gould\u2019s railroads had contracts with Western\nUnion allowing it to operate telegraph lines along the road. He canceled\nthe contracts and signed agreements to partner with the lines attached\nto several other railroads. After he bought ocean lines to Latin\nAmerica, Western Union was scared enough to purchase the competitor.\n(Gould sealed the deal by offering Vanderbilt, Western Union\u2019s largest\nstockholder, a controlling stake in one of his railroads if he persuaded\nthe board to go through with the purchase.) After the sale, Gould\nstarted a new company with the telegraph lines of his remaining\nrailroads, signed several additional deals, and announced plans to build\na transatlantic cable. Western Union stock plummeted and Gould bought it\nup, becoming his competitor\u2019s largest shareholder. He used this position\nto persuade Western Union to purchase his competitor at an inflated\nprice and become the controlling member of Western Union\u2019s board, a\nposition he used to fend off any future competitors.\n\nTheodore Vail played a similar role at AT&T, while local utilities\n(power, light, heat) ended up being operated by regulated \u201cnatural\nmonopolies\u201d. Soon the nation\u2019s infrastructure was entirely owned by\neither public (e.g. the post office) or private (AT&T) monopolies. In\neach case, it was operated by professional managers who planned and\ncontrolled the entire system.\n\nPart 3\n------\n\nThe new national infrastructure (railroads, telegraph, steamships, post\noffice) allowed for new national distributors (wholesalers, department\nstores, mail-order houses, chains) which were themselves organized and\nmanaged in the same ways. Department stores, for example, had a manager\nin charge of each department, with only things like janitors and\ndelivery people shared across the entire store.\n\nSuch big stores moved to also take the place of wholesalers by building\ntheir own distribution networks and, in time, take control of\nmanufacturing as well. Large mail-order houses like Sears Roebuck began\nbuilding systems of conveyer belts and pneumatic tubes for ensuring\norders got assembled promptly \u2014 along with systems for punishing those\nwho held the line up. And the geographically-distributed chain stores\norganized themselves under regional managers who kept tabs on local\nperformance with a team of inspectors.\n\nGeographic centralization, automation, and employee monitoring allowed\nsuch national concerns to move goods faster, which made them more\nefficient than the numerous local stores they put out of business. It\nwas economies of speed, not of scale.\n\nA similar speeding-up happened in production. The opening of the coal\nmines provided cheap power for new factories with mass-production\nmachines while railroads provided a market their output. The factories\nwere set up as simple assembly lines operating continuous-process\nmachines, like those built to cut wheat, solder cans, and roll\ncigarettes. Henry Ford extended this system into assembly with his\n\u201cmoving assembly line\u201d in which continuous conveyor belts moved parts\npast the workers. In each factory, managers personally oversaw the line\nforemen who oversaw each part of the process. By the 1880 census, 80% of\nmanufacturing employees worked in factories, with the putting-out system\nremaining only for clothing.\n\nFredrick W. Taylor encouraged factories to speed up even further by\nfollowing his system of \u201cscientific management\u201d. He proposed a company\u2019s\nlines be run by a planning department which would conduct careful\ntime-and-motions studies to discover the optimal way to carry out each\npart of the process. Line-level managers would then be responsible for\nensuring that individual employees kept producing at the optimal rate.\nFew followed Taylor\u2019s recommendations exactly, especially his suggestion\nto place the planning department in charge of the lines, but many\ncompanies adopted his ideas to accelerate their factories.\n\nPart 4\n------\n\nThe new speeds, in turn, produced so many products that the national\nstores couldn\u2019t sell them all, leading the manufacturers into\ndistribution and marketing of their own. They began building a regional\nsales staff, doing national ad campaigns, and buying up competitors. The\nresult was national brands like American Tobacco, Diamond Match, Quaker\nOats, Pillsbury Flour, Campbell Soup, Heinz, Borden, Carnation, Libby,\nProcter & Gamble, and Kodak \u2014 most of which remain leaders today.\n\nWhy did these few leaders achieve such domination? It was not thru their\nsuperior technology \u2014 they leased the machines they use for assembly.\nNor was it their marketing acumen \u2014 they all hired professional\nmarketers for the job. And it could not be the power of their brands,\nfor they all invented these brands from scratch. Instead, it was their\nsuperior organization that provided the main barrier to entry. Anyone\nwho wanted to compete would have to build their own national network of\nmanagers, buyers, and salesmen.\n\nAnd even this was made more difficult for competitors. The first-mover\nwas able to start small, use profits to fund growth, and use the\nresulting economies of scale to lower prices while expanding nationally.\nBut any competitor would have to start out by competing against this\nnational, low-price network. They would either have much higher per-item\ncosts since they were producing so much less or they would have to\nborrow enormous amounts of capital to build a high-volume network from\nthe beginning. And who would want to fund such a risky endeavor?\nNewcomers did appear (Kellogg, Postum, Colgate, Babbitt) but they were\nrare and the industries remain oligopolies.\n\nIndustrial products (lumber, petroleum, metal, etc.) also began forming\nnational oligopolies. It started with industry-wide trade associates,\nwhich quickly became cartels that conspired to fix prices. However, the\nincentive to cheat on the cartels by secretly lowering prices was too\ngreat and, since cartels were illegal, there was no legal way to prevent\nit. So companies moved to form trusts, in which one firm would hold in\ntrust the shares of the other firms in exchange for shares of itself.\nWhen the Sherman Antitrust Act outlawed trusts, New Jersey stepped in to\nallow the creation of holding companies \u2014 easy-to-establish corporations\nwhich simply held the stock of other corporations. But in the early\n1900s the courts ruled that even this form violated the law and the\ncompanies moved to merge outright, forming a single corporation.\n\nBut such horizontal integration was rarely very profitable. The real\nsuccess always came from vertical integration: taking control of\nsuppliers and distribution.\n\nPart 5\n------\n\nManagers who oversaw the factories carefully measured their efficiency.\nThey wanted to maximize the use of the expensive equipment they had\npurchased, so the repeatedly pushed to speed up the lines and use them\nmore efficiency. This increased efficiency resulted in increased\nproduction which resulted in corporate growth which naturally required\nmore lines.\n\nAt the same time corporations continued this within-industry expansion,\nhigher-level managers saw the generic processes at work and pushed for\nbetween-industry expansion: reusing the same management structures and\nsame tools to grow the company and brand into new businesses.\n\nAnd thus, managerial capitalism \u2014 the corporate form in which\nprofessional managers ran large, national corporation whose owners had\nat most veto power over their efforts \u2014 spread across the country. Their\nadministrative coordination allowed for greater productivity and lower\ncosts, but required a managerial hierarchy which could carry out more\nfunctions. The managers also allowed them to increase volume, but also\nallowed the managers to ensure a permanent place for themselves. The\ntask of management became more technical and specialized and management\nbecame separated from ownership. As a result, managers were able to\ndirect the company in ways that favored stability over profits, and the\nresulting huge enterprises changed the shape of the economy.\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674940520"], "time": 1204444800.0, "postid": "visiblehand", "internal_links": []}, "rhetocc": {"post_title": "Justifications for Myself", "tags": [], "post_content": "Justifications for Myself\n=========================\n\nFebruary 6, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rhetocc)\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou\u2019re at a party and you find yourself sitting next to an rather\ngeeky-looking fellow with thick black glasses.

As\nan academic at a state college in Pennsylvania, he\u2019s surrounded by\nRepublicans who want to cut off public support for tenured radicals like\nhim. As a postmodern literary theorist who writes for public-interest\njournals, he\u2019s surrounded by those who think his field is meaninglessly\nobscure. As a professor of cultural studies, he\u2019s surrounded by those\nwho think he\u2019s wasting his time researching trash. And as a cultural\nleftist with liberal political views, he\u2019s surrounded by friends who\nfind his nuanced political views a personal affront.\n\nIn *Rhetorical Occasions*, B\u00e9rub\u00e9 collects a series of essays, speeches,\narticles, and blog posts in which he tries his best to defend himself\nfrom all such charges. And while that doesn\u2019t sound like a recipe for\ngood literature, he makes it work. Like my entomologist friend, B\u00e9rub\u00e9\nis such a kind-hearted, clear-spoken fellow that it\u2019s fun to simply hear\nhim out. The result is a book even better than B\u00e9rub\u00e9\u2019s [2006\nbestseller](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/radicalarts), *What\u2019s Liberal\nAbout the Liberal Arts?*\n\nThe difference is that this time B\u00e9rub\u00e9 is writing for his fellow\ninsiders, not outsiders, so instead of his cleaned-up defense of\nacademic life and his tidied-up summaries of freshman classes, you get\nthe real dirt on the way people dig knives into each other at MLA\nmeetings and excerpts from graduate introductory courses.\n\nThe book isn\u2019t always perfect. B\u00e9rub\u00e9\u2019s writes clearly and well, but\nsometimes even his careful explanations assume a bit too much background\nfrom the reader. \u201cIt sounds almost like a Monty Python bit,\u201d he says at\none point; \u201cyou expect to hear next that Alexander Kerensky was defeated\nby the experimental poetics of the Opoyaz group, and that the Battle of\nthe Journals set the terms for the Second Congress of Soviets in October\n1917.\u201d I have to admit, that was not what I was expecting to hear next.\n\nAnd while B\u00e9rub\u00e9 is fairly good about mentioning his opponents\u2019\narguments (and this is a book with a lot of opponents, from ice hockey\nplayers to Stanley Fish), he sometimes responds to them with an\nobtuseness that borders on intellectual dishonesty. He notes that he was\n\u201cderided on the far left [for] my craven desire to break into corporate\nmass media by repudiating Chomsky. I wrote it for *Context: A Forum for\nLiterary Arts and Culture*, [a journal] not available for purchase\nanywhere in the country. It is distributed only to independent\nbookstores, in print runs of five thousand. So I wonder just how much\nfurther from the corporate mass media Chomsky\u2019s fans would like me to\nget before I am permitted to disagree with them.\u201d It\u2019s one of the book\u2019s\nbest lines, at least until you get a couple essays later when you find\nB\u00e9rub\u00e9 reprised the criticism for an op-ed in the *Boston Globe*.\n\nBut the meat of the book is not in B\u00e9rub\u00e9\u2019s politics (which, reprising\ndiscussions between 9/11 and the war in Iraq, actually made me feel\nqueasy), but in his academics. In even intellectual popular culture,\nit\u2019s hard to find examples of postmodern literary theory that are\nanything other than critics taking a whack or exponents making it easy\nfor them. Alan Sokal gets up and says that social constructionism is\nabsurd and Stanley Fish fights back by insisting the rules of physics\nare just as manmade as the rules of baseball. Roger Kimball complaints\nthat postmodern theorists are being deliberately obtuse and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\nresponds by wondering whether \u201cHeidegger\u2019s \u2018deconstruction\u2019 of the\nmetaphysics of subjectivity \u2026 undermine[s] the very possibility of a\nphilosophically grounded resistance.\u201d\n\nBut B\u00e9rub\u00e9 manages to make such debates seem comprehensible and, what\u2019s\nmore, worth comprehending. B\u00e9rub\u00e9\u2019s passing references to \u201cStephen\nGreenblatt, Catherine Gallagher, nancy Armstrong, Even Sedgwick, and\nJudith Butler\u201d makes you think that recognizing such names is as much a\nduty of an educated person as following Sokal\u2019s references to Niels\nBohr, Werner Heisenberg, and (as in famous footnote 26) Rebecca\nGoldstein.\n\nI just hope there are more patient teachers like B\u00e9rub\u00e9 to help one\nfinish the job.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0807857777)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0807857777"], "time": 1170748800.0, "postid": "rhetocc", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/radicalarts"]}, "cultfrags": {"post_title": "Reflections on Cultural Fragments", "tags": [], "post_content": "Reflections on Cultural Fragments\n=================================\n\nAugust 26, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/cultfrags)\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Six Feet Under\u2019s final episode:** After the second-to-last episode of\n*Six Feet Under* aired, I was having lunch with my partner Simon. \u2018I\nwonder what they\u2019ll do for the last episode,\u2019 I said. \u2018Obviously they\u2019ll\nhave to kill everyone off, but how?

It originally appeared\nin [somewhat different\nform](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dya/what_are_the_optimal_biases_to_overcome/)\non Less Wrong.*\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that some people have complimented my series [Raw\nNerve](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve) by saying it\u2019s a great\nexplanation of cognitive biases. Which always amuses me, since the\nseries grew out of frustrations I had with the usual way that term gets\nused. There\u2019s a group of people (call them the cognitive bias community)\nwho say the way to be more rational \u2014 to get better at making decisions\nthat get you what you want \u2014 is to work at overcoming your biases. But\nif you\u2019re overcoming biases, surely there are some lessons that will\nhelp you more than others.\n\nYou might start with the most famous ones, which tend to be the ones\npopularized by Kahneman and Tversky. But K&T were academics. They\nweren\u2019t trying to help people be more rational, they were trying to\nprove to other academics that people were irrational. The result is that\nthey focused not on the most important biases, but the ones that were\neasiest to prove.\n\nTake their famous anchoring experiment, in which they showed the spin of\na roulette wheel affected people\u2019s estimates about African countries.\nThe idea wasn\u2019t that roulette wheels causing biased estimates was a huge\nsocial problem; it was that no academic could possibly argue that this\nbehavior was somehow rational. They thereby scored a decisive blow for\npsychology against economists claiming we\u2019re just rational maximizers.\n\nMost academic work on irrationality has followed in K&T\u2019s footsteps.\nAnd, in turn, much of the stuff done by the wider cognitive bias\ncommunity has followed in the footsteps of this academic work. So it\u2019s\nnot hard to believe that cognitive bias types are good at avoiding these\nbiases and thus do well on the psychology tests for them. (Indeed, many\nof the questions on these tests for rationality come straight from K&T\nexperiments!)\n\nBut if you look at the average person and ask why they aren\u2019t getting\nwhat they want, very rarely do you conclude their biggest problem is\nthat they\u2019re suffering from anchoring, framing effects, the planning\nfallacy, commitment bias, or any of the other stuff in these tests.\nUsually their biggest problems are far more quotidian and\ncommonsensical, like procrastination and fear.\n\nOne of the things that struck me was watching Eliezer Yudkowsky, one of\nthe most impressive writers on the topic of cognitive biases, try to\nstart a new nonprofit. For years, the organization he founded struggled\nuntil recently, when Luke Muehlhauser was named executive director.\nEliezer readily agrees that Luke has done more to achieve Eliezer\u2019s own\ngoals for the organization than Eliezer ever did.\n\nBut why? Why is Luke so much better at getting what Eliezer wants than\nEliezer is? It\u2019s surely not because Luke is so much better at avoiding\nthe standard cognitive biases! Luke often talks about how he\u2019s\nconstantly learning new rationality techniques from Eliezer.\n\nNo, it\u2019s because Luke did what seems like common sense: he bought a copy\nof *Nonprofits for Dummies* and did what it recommends. As Luke himself\n[says](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/6klg?context=1#6l4h),\nit wasn\u2019t lack of intelligence or resources or willpower that kept\nEliezer from doing these things, \u201cit was a gap in general rationality.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re interested in closing the gap, it seems like the skills to\nprioritize aren\u2019t things like commitment effect and the sunk cost\nfallacy, but stuff like \u201cfigure out what your goals really are\u201d, \u201clook\nat your situation objectively and list the biggest problems\u201d, \u201cwhen\nyou\u2019re trying something new and risky, read the For Dummies book about\nit first\u201d, etc. That\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m interested in writing about.\n", "external_links": ["http://lesswrong.com/lw/dya/what_are_the_optimal_biases_to_overcome/", "http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/6klg?context=1#6l4h"], "time": 1346223600.0, "postid": "optimalbias", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve"]}, "petersinger": {"post_title": "Meeting Peter Singer", "tags": ["politics", "morality"], "post_content": "Meeting Peter Singer\n====================\n\nNovember 13, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/petersinger)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI remember watching an episode of *Penn & Teller* about animal rights.\nAs usual, the show mostly consisted of a long series of clips relating\nto animal rights, followed by comments from Penn making fun of the idea.\nThis show, I recall, was particularly weak. They didn\u2019t even pretend to\nmake an argument; it was entirely mockery.\n\nWatching this, I couldn\u2019t help but realize there was a powerful logical\nargument at the core of the animal rights groups: animals should be\ntreated much the same way humans are \u2014 their lives should be respected,\ntheir pain minimized, etc. Make this one simple change to your system of\nmorality and everything else falls into place. PETA actually seems kind\nof measured when they refer to \u201cthe Holocaust on your plate\u201d.\n\nPeter Singer is the moral philosopher who has probably done the most to\npromote this idea. With a wide-ranging career spanning from Marx to\nmeat, his book *Animal Liberation*, which quietly and thoughtfully makes\nthis case, is widely-regarded as launching the animal liberation\nmovement.\n\nI was recently dragged to the Boston Vegetarian Festival to see Singer\nspeak about his new book, *The Way We Eat*, and was deeply impressed by\nhis thoughtfulness and clarity of mind. An aging fellow with thoughtful\nglasses, he looks like Noam Chomsky, another plainspoken professor. He\nis not a passionate activist who has taken on the cause of animals, but\nsimply what he appears: a moral philosopher who started thinking about\nthe issue one day and drew the logical conclusions.\n\nAfter his talk, a woman in the audience asked a question about the\nrumors that he would sometimes eat non-vegan food. The audience was\nscandalized. \u201cLet me address that,\u201d Singer said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in\nveganism as a religion. I simply believe that refraining from eating\nanimal products is the most effective way of putting pressure on\nproducers to stop abusing and killing animals. Sometimes, if a host\nmisunderstands my request and makes non-vegan food, instead of throwing\nit away, I will eat it. I don\u2019t think this is a problem, because I don\u2019t\nthink this does any moral harm.\u201d\n\nAnother person asked how he could say good things about Whole Foods when\nthey were still serving numerous animal products. \u201cWhole Foods has the\nbest standards for animal treatment of any major organization,\u201d he\nreplied. \u201cThat\u2019s simply a fact. And, I think it\u2019s a good thing. Do I\nthink not using animals at all would be even better? Of course. But I\npraise people for the good things they do and condemn them for the bad\nones.\u201d\n\nA final question raised the incrementalism versus revolutionism debate\ncommon to all left-wing social movements. Should one really worry about\nanimal treatment when the animals were still going to be killed? Pinger\nsaid the answer was undoubtedly yes. \u201cLook, I thought that when *Animal\nLiberation* came out everyone would read it and become a vegan. But it\u2019s\nbeen thirty years and vegans are still less than 10% of the population.\nIf you genuinely care about animal suffering, you have to admit that,\nand say, \u2018what else can we do to ease animal suffering?\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Singer\u2019s talk, I began thinking through the consequences of his\nmorality. A question occurred to me: \u201cShould we also stop animals from\neating each other?\u201d I was sure others had made such arguments as\n*reductio ad absurdums* of vegetarianism, but I thought I might be the\nfirst to be genuinely interested in it from a moral perspective.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said my friend. \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault if the animals kill\neach other.\u201d \u201cYou mean,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you think it\u2019s perfectly moral to\nlet that guy\u201d \u2014 I pointed at a random guy nearby \u2014 \u201cgo around killing\npeople?\u201d \u201cWell, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s different with animals, because\nthey don\u2019t know any better.\u201d \u201cYou mean it would be OK to let him go\naround killing people if he was mentally ill and didn\u2019t realize he was\ndoing it?\u201d \u201cYou should go ask Singer,\u201d he said.\n\nSo I did \u2014 he was signing books outside the lecture hall and as the line\nended I asked him my question. His answer was even better than I\nimagined: \u201cWe would if we knew how to do so without making things worse\nand disturbing the ecosystems and so on.\u201d \u201cThanks!\u201d I said, impressed.\nHe spied the large white book I was hugging to my chest. \u201cAre you\nreading Kolakowski?\u201d he asked. \u201cYep,\u201d I said smiling. \u201cHad to read that\nwhen I was studying Marx a long time ago. It\u2019s heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite\nliterally!\u201d I replied, hefting the 1200 page book. He smiled.\n\n\u201cI have to say, though,\u201d I said, feeling guilty, \u201cthat I don\u2019t agree\nwith your *Darwinian Left* stuff.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t\nneed to agree with everything I write.\u201d Then he wandered off, looking\nfor the next thing to see.\n\nI had to get that off my chest, because it was the one thing bugging me\nabout Singer. Somehow later in life Singer had become a sociobiologist,\none of that vulgar group of psuedoscientists who insist \u2014 despite all\nevidence \u2014 that humans are genetically programmed to do all everything a\nright-wing politician could imagine. (Sociobiology having gotten a bad\nname, they now call themselves evolutionary psychologists.)\n\nIn his book *A Darwinian Left*, however, Singer explains that this is no\nreason for the left to despair. If people are actually born stupid,\nthat\u2019s only *more* justification for left-wing policies. We need to\nprovide the stupid people with the extra resources to live on equal\nterms as the smart people. Steven Pinker cites this book (along with\nSinger\u2019s *The Expanding Circle*) several times in his execrable *Blank\nSlate* to prove that his noxious views aren\u2019t necessarily right-wing.\n(Neither Pinker nor Singer, of course, provide any real evidence to show\nthis actually is the way humans are.)\n\nThat said, as usual Singer\u2019s conclusions do follow from his premises \u2014\nif you do make that one small change to the way you think the world\nworks, then his conclusions about what we should do to remedy it\nundoubtedly follow.

The classic answer\u2014fixing the\nroot causes of crime\u2014now seems hopelessly ambitious. And our natural\nsympathy for the millions ground down by an out-of-control prison system\nand a pointless war on drugs doesn\u2019t play well with voters, especially\nwhen most criminals can\u2019t vote. The general belief seems to be that the\nproblem of crime has been solved\u2014after all, crime levels have dropped\ndramatically since the law-and-order 80s\u2014and that the real problem now\nis not too much crime, but too much punishment. If voters don\u2019t agree,\nit\u2019s because TV news continues to obsess over violent crime even as\nactual occurrences of it have cratered, leaving behind a population who\nwants to do even more to crack down on an army of bad guys who don\u2019t\nreally exist. The smartest liberal position on crime seems to be\nchanging the subject and talking about white-collar crime instead\n(which, as recent economic news has made clear, is a real epidemic).\n\nMark Kleiman, in his brilliant new book, *When Brute Force Fails*, takes\na different view. Crime, aside from drug crimes (where his work\npersuasively argues that \u201cthe abuse of illicit drugs is a human tragedy\nbut not a major threat to the social order\u201d), is serious. (Presumably\nthis only applies to classic violent crimes; it\u2019s obvious this logic\ndoesn\u2019t work for violations of copyright law and civil disobedience.)\nEven where there\u2019s a small amount of actual crime, it\u2019s possible that\u2019s\njust because people are wasting so much time preventing it. There\u2019s a\nserious social cost to having to remember to lock our doors and carry\nour keys around all the time, let alone the money we waste on burglar\nalarms and car-tracking services and all the rest.\n\nWhile I find the methodology he uses to show it wildly\nproblematic^[1](#fn:fn1)^, I agree with his point that crime really\nsucks. Even if a burglar only causes \\$400 worth of damage, I\u2019d pay far\nmore than \\$400 to prevent a burglary \u2014 the loss of privacy, the sense\nof violation, the disruption of my normal order, the distraction of\nhaving to deal with police and repairmen and insurance agents, etc. all\nadd up to make burglary a nightmare well above the direct economic\ndamage it causes.\n\nSuch things are a frustration for white suburbanites, but for poor\npeople stuck in the ghetto, they\u2019re a nightmare. Crime is yet another\ndisadvantage and a particularly noxious one at that. Even aside from all\nthe other indignities suffered by the poor, just imagining life in a\ncrime-ridden neighborhood is enough to make your skin crawl.\n\nBut, Kleiman insists, we also have to count the harm to the criminals!\nGoing through lengthy court proceedings, spending years in abusive\nprisons, having to deal with officious parole officers and the loss of\nliberty they cause are all serious costs and we can\u2019t wave them away\njust because they happen to the bad guys. Law enforcement isn\u2019t a\nzero-sum game: both criminals and victims can benefit from less\npunishment.^[2](#fn:fnr)^\n\nSo there\u2019s the question: How can we have less crime with less\npunishment? The first thing to notice is that low-crime is an\nequilibrium state: if nobody is committing any crimes, all anti-crime\nresources can be focused on anyone who decides to break the law, making\nit irrational for them to even try. But high-crime is also an\nequilibrium (assuming reasonable levels of punishment): if everyone is\nbreaking the law, the police can\u2019t possibly stop all of them, so it\u2019s\nnot so risky to keep on breaking the law.\n\nTo reduce both crime and punishment, you just need to tip the society\nfrom one equilibrium to the other. And, Kleiman argues, we can do that\nwith a technique he calls \u201cdynamic concentration.\u201d Imagine there are\nthree robbers (Alice, Bob, and Carol) and one policeman (Eve). Eve can\nonly stop one robber at a crime, so if more than one person is\ncommitting a burglary at the same time, she decides to be fair and\nswitch around who she arrests \u2014 sometimes she nabs Alice, sometimes Bob,\nsometimes Carol.\n\nThe problem is that the robbers know this and they know it means they\nonly have a 1/3 chance of getting caught. A guaranteed arrest is bad\nnews, but a 1/3 chance of getting arrested isn\u2019t worth quitting over. So\nthe robbers keep on robbing and the cop keeps failing to keep up with\nthem.\n\nBut now imagine Eve adopts a new policy: dynamic concentration. Instead\nof randomly deciding who to go after, she goes after people in\nalphabetical order. So if Alice is committing a crime, Eve always goes\nafter her first if she\u2019s committing a crime \u2014 otherwise Bob, and then\nCarol. Now Alice knows that if she robs someone, she\u2019s guaranteed to get\ncaught (instead of just having a one-third chance), so she decides to\nsit this one out. You might think this would just lead Bob to step into\nthe breach, but now that Alice is out, Eve can turn her focus to Bob\ninstead. So Bob also decides to call it quits. That just leaves Carol,\nwho Eve now gets to watch like a hawk, and so Carol also gives up the\ngame. And there you have it: dynamic concentration stops all the crime\nwithout adding any more police.\n\nObviously things aren\u2019t so clean in the real world, but I think this is\nthe first game-theoretic argument I\u2019ve read that seems to have some real\nforce. Kleiman backs it up with some messier simulations and some\nreal-life examples. Unfortunately, most are stories about cracking down\non drugs or other unserious crimes like squeegee men, but the general\npoint seems to work.\n\nFor twenty years, High Point, North Carolina had tried to fight the\ncrack dealing in the city\u2019s African-American West End neighborhood. Any\nviewer of *The Wire* can guess the results: as soon as they made a case\nagainst one drug dealer, another would jump in to take his place. So\nwith the help of crime scholar David Kennedy, they tried a new approach.\nFirst, they spent months building trust between the police and the\ncommunity to build consensus that the drug trade was something worth\nstopping. Then they pushed extra resources into the neighborhood and\nstarted putting together cases against the dealers \u2014 but didn\u2019t make any\narrests. Only when they had a case against every known dealer did they\nact.\n\nEven then they didn\u2019t make arrests. They visited the dealer\u2019s homes with\na neighborhood leader, who told them that the neighborhood had decided\nthey had to go straight. Meanwhile a cop presented them with the legal\ncase against them. The pair asked the dealer to quit and offered\nwhatever services\u2014tattoo removal, job training\u2014would help them do that.\nTen of the thirteen dealers took them up on the offer, leaving plenty of\nroom for the justice system to lock up the remaining three, plus the one\nnew dealer who tried to take over their old business. Five years later,\nthe market is still closed, and the police have been able to direct\ntheir resources to pull the same trick on the other drug markets. Crime\nis down, and arrests are down too. Dynamic concentration works, with the\ncity\u2019s different drug markets standing in for Alice, Carol, and Bob.\n(The other examples\u2014especially Hawaii\u2019s HOPE program\u2014are even more\ninteresting, but take longer to tell.)\n\nDynamic concentration isn\u2019t a panacea. Obviously it only works where the\ncosts of monitoring are much less than the costs of enforcement. But\nthis still leaves lots of opportunities and clever selection of the\npopulation to concentrate on can significantly decrease the cost of\nmonitoring.\n\nWhile the big idea of dynamic concentration is at the center of the\nbook, it\u2019s not one of those one-trick monographs where the author lays\nout one good idea and then spends the rest of the book repeating it.\nInstead, the book ranges over the whole theory and practice crime\ncontrol in America and nearly every page is filled with interesting\nfacts and a new perspective.\n\nAnd in a brilliant final chapter, he turns his lens on himself and asks\nwhat could go wrong with his proposals. For an intellectual, the level\nof humility and self-criticism involved is truly impressive. (He\nconfesses to probably all of the complaints that you\u2019re thinking about\nraising right now.)\n\nFor anyone interested in policy analysis, this book should be a classic.\nIt shows how simple tools (calculating the scale of the problem,\nmodeling it with game theory, and calculating the costs of a solution)\ncan have radical implications.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691142084)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Kleiman uses surveys asking people how much they would pay to\n    achieve a ten percent reduction in a crime. Aside from all the usual\n    problems with such willingness-to-pay metrics, this seems like a\n    particularly meaningless question. I don\u2019t have a good sense of what\n    the crime rate is, let alone what a 10% decrease in it would look\n    like. I can\u2019t possibly assign a sensible monetary value to something\n    so abstract. It\u2019d be better to ask people what they\u2019d pay to prevent\n    one crime, assuming the crime rate is low enough that [Karelis-type\n    effects](http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300120905)\n    don\u2019t come into play.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn1)\n\n2.  Since a rational criminal would by definition be better off\n    committing the crime, this mainly comes up in cases of information\n    asymmetry. Unlike in playground games of Cops and Robbers, real\n    police are better off warning the criminals away from doing crime\n    than tricking them into doing it and then sneaking up and catching\n    them.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fnr)\n\n\n", "external_links": ["#fn:fn1", "#fn:fnr", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691142084", "http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300120905", "#fnref:fn1", "#fnref:fnr"], "time": 1287385200.0, "postid": "bruteforce", "internal_links": []}, "facedepress": {"post_title": "Do Faces Cause Depression?: Self-Experimentation in Science", "tags": [], "post_content": "Do Faces Cause Depression?: Self-Experimentation in Science\n===========================================================\n\nApril 23, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/facedepress)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt all started, Seth Roberts says, when he wanted more practice doing\nexperiments. The closest thing at hand was himself. He was trying to\ntreat his acne and, although convinced that the pills were effective and\nthe cream was not, he decided to chart their effectiveness anyway for\npractice. The results were the exact opposite of what he expected \u2014 the\ncream helped and the pills did not. His acne went away and Roberts went\nlooking for bigger problems to solve.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that sleep follows some sort of circular rhythm, an inner\nbiological clock that makes us tired at the end of the day and refreshed\nat the beginning. This is the clock that gets thrown off when we travel\nand thus causes jet lag, for example. But what if other things mess with\nthe clock than simply when we go to sleep?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t simply academic for Roberts, who frustrated from a serious\nbout of \u201cearly awakening\u201d, in which he\u2019d wake up around 4am feeling\ntired but unable to get back to sleep for another couple of hours.\nRoberts searched for a way to cure his problem but none of the standard\nmethods seemed appropriate. So he decided to research the subject.\n\nA 1979 study of people in caves suggested that contact with other people\naffected when we fell asleep and a 1985 survey of daily activities in 12\ncountries led to another clue: Americans were much more often awake\naround midnight than people in any other country and the only\ndistinguishing factor seemed to be late-night television. Perhaps,\nRoberts thought, watching television could influence sleeping rhythm?\n\nThe most popular late-night television show at the time the study was\ndone was the *The Tonight Show*, with its person-heavy monologue. So one\nmorning Roberts decided to watch Jay Leno and David Letterman\u2019s\nmonologues. It seemed to have no impact; an otherwise normal day. But\nthe *next* morning he woke up feeling great.\n\nIt was hard to believe that the television show could be responsible, so\nRoberts decided to formalize the study. Every hour he\u2019d write down three\nnumbers between 0 and 100 to measure how unhappy/happy,\nirritable/serene, and reluctant/eager he was. And then he tried turning\nthe TV watching on and off again to see if it impacted his mood. It did\n\u2014 he always felt better the next day. So he tried adjusting the show and\ntelevision set, finding that, despite his love for *The Simpsons*,\nlife-size human faces at about a meter away for 30 minutes worked best.\n\nI have to concede, at this point, that the results sound fairly absurd\nand unbelievable. But reading [Roberts\u2019s papers on the\nsubject](http://sethroberts.net/self-experiment/), what\u2019s striking is\nhow careful he is about the subject. An actual psychologist, publishing\nin psychology journals, he\u2019s taken into account every objection. The\nresults *cannot* be, as one would first expect, simply self-induced by\nhis own wishes. For one, Roberts took quantitative notes, so his memory\ncouldn\u2019t be playing tricks on him. For another, the size of the\ndifference was too large to be explained through normal explanations. If\nRoberts could simply *will* himself into waking up happy, why hadn\u2019t he\ndone it before? Nor could such an explanation explain the numbers\u2019s\ncareful sensitivity to how similar the TV watching was to human face\ncontact, especially since Roberts was originally hoping to be able to\nwatch his favorite shows, not face-heavy ones like *Charlie Rose*.\n\nHe also began noticing something he wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 his mood wasn\u2019t\njust raised the next morning, it was lowered that night. This graph\nshows the pattern:\n\n![Graph of mood over the course of 48 hours based on whether faces were\nseen or not.](image1_facedepress)\n\nMood spikes up from 6am to noon, stays high during the day, and then\ntakes a dive around 6pm. (When not seeing faces, mood stays flat.)\n\nAnd what about all those people who watched TV at night? Roberts found\nthat watching TV after 6pm also reduced mood, with the effect more\npronounced the later it was watched.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? If you look at faces in the morning, you feel worse\n12 hours later but better 24 hours later. But the effect is muted if you\nsee faces in the evening. Roberts theorizes that your body is using the\nfaces to set its inner mood clock, which works similarly to its inner\ntiredness clock. You want to be happy during the day (as opposed to the\nnight), but how do you tell when the day starts? The body assumes that\nyou gab with people when you wake up, so it uses seeing other faces as a\nway to synchronize the clock. Of course, you want to make sure you\u2019ve\ngot the timing right on the nighttime side as well, so if you see faces\nlate in the evening it tries to tweak the clock then as well.\n\nThis is consistent with what we know from other sources about\ndepression. Depression is highly correlated with insomnia as well as\nsocial isolation and is often treated by disturbing sleep. The Amish,\nwho eat breakfast communally and go to bed very early, have 1/100th the\nrate of depression as other Americans. And depression rates increased by\n10 times in the 1900s, around the same time radio/TV, electric lighting,\nand other such things became common.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to get a chance to test this myself, but it sure appears that\none easy way to improve mood is to look at faces in the morning.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOf course, even more than mood (which is generally considered difficult\nto tweak) people want to improve their look. And Roberts has done\nresearch on this as well, concluding that the body uses a similar\ninternal system to measure the ideal weight. The result is his\nShangri-La Diet which uses similar techniques to trick the body\u2019s\ninternal system to cut down on appetite. His book on the subject, [*The\nShangri-La Diet*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0399153640), comes out\nthis week. It\u2019s been hailed as a diet book unlike any other.

Their nefarious plan\ndramatically exacerbates inequality, making the rich filthy rich while\nthe poor suffer terrible levels of unemployment.\n\nThe difference is that in the Batman universe, Gotham\u2019s leading\nbillionaire (Thomas Wayne) can\u2019t stand the suffering and begins\ninvesting in the city when the government won\u2019t. He builds a giant\nKeynesian supertrain in a desperate attempt to get the city back to\nwork. But, in an ironic twist, he ends up murdered by one of the\ndesperate poverty-stricken citizens he\u2019s trying so hard to help.\n\nThe murder of the billionaire shocks the surviving billionaires, leading\nthem to reverse their neoliberal policies. Instead of getting tough on\ncrime, they decide to indulge criminals, with a deep willingness to\ntreat criminality as merely a mental health problem.\n\nAs the billionaires retreat from power, organized crime steps in, taking\ntheir place in buying off judges and unions and cops. Instead of being\nrun by Wayne Enterprises, the city ends up being run by mob boss Carmine\nFalcone.\n\nBut a few rogue elements in the police and DA\u2019s office refuse to be\nbought off. They free the man who murdered Thomas Wayne in exchange for\nhis testimony against Falcone. Bruce Wayne, the billionaire\u2019s son, is so\nhaunted by his personal demons that he can\u2019t stand this trade-off. When\nhis childhood-friend-turned-rogue-ADA points out the selfishness of his\nposition, he confronts Falcone. When Falcone explains that Bruce will\nalways live in fear of what he does not understand, Bruce sets off on a\nquest to understand criminals.\n\nHis search concludes in a far eastern terrorist training camp, which\nturns out to be backed by the same global forces of evil that invented\nneoliberalism. It\u2019s the year 2000 and they have a new plan: attacking\nGotham with the hope of inspiring enough fear that the city will destroy\nitself.^[2](#fn:rg)^\n\nBruce, still haunted by the execution of his parents, refuses to become\nan executioner himself and, instead of joining the plot, sets fire to\nthe camp before returning to clean up Gotham his own way. He begins by\nputting together a case against Falcone and re-seizing control of Wayne\nEnterprises by buying up its shares on the public market.\n\nIn doing so, he begins a reversal of history that eventually culminates\nin [*The Dark Knight Rises*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr). His\nattack on Falcone leads to a new era of tough-on-crime, which dethrones\nthe organized criminals and allows the wealthy to seize power again. The\nwealthy quickly reinstitute neoliberalism and buy back Bruce\u2019s shares on\nthe public market, putting Wayne Enterprises back in their hands. But\nthe global forces of evil step in once again to \u201crestore balance\u201d by\nletting Bane to release the organized criminals.^[3](#fn:gfe)^ Bruce\nWayne goes back to being an innocent child of privilege and the trilogy\nends exactly where it started.^[4](#fn:rob)^\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  *Batman Begins* is very clearly the mirror image of [*The Dark\n    Knight Rises*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr) (some scenes are\n    almost word-for-word the same), so understanding one can help us\n    understand the other.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn1)\n\n2.

And off they go, investigating the mining industry to\nmake sure they\u2019re being safe.\n\nOnly something funny happens. It turns out all the people they talk to\nall day are mining industry officials. And whenever they hold meetings\nto ask for advice, the only people who show up are mining industry\nofficials. When they make proposals and ask for public comment, all the\ncomments are from mining industry officials. And pretty soon, they start\nthinking like mining industry officials.\n\nAcademics call this regulatory capture \u2014 an office was put in place to\nregulate an industry, but it ended up just being a tool of the industry.\n\nBut what\u2019s striking is that the problem isn\u2019t just limited to\nregulation; the same thing happens to journalists as well. Call it\njournalistic capture. And there are few examples of it more obvious than\nthat of CNBC.\n\nCNBC, a channel supposed to cover economic news, basically acts as a\nfull-time cheerleader for the financial industry. When the market was\nbooming, this wasn\u2019t so noticeable. Whole swaths of the country started\ndaytrading and checking the CNBC ticker regularly to feed their buy-sell\ntrigger fingers.\n\nBut now that the market\u2019s gone belly-up, it all seems a whole lot less\nappealing. Which is what Jon Stewart has been getting at with his\ncritiques of the network.\n\nWell, it\u2019s less satisfying to complain when you can actually do\nsomething about it, so some friends and I have started a new campaign:\n**Fix CNBC!** [As HuffPo\nreported](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/16/economists-progresses-pet_n_175249.html),\nwe\u2019re demanding CNBC commit to holding Wall Street accountable, starting\nwith hiring someone who was *right* about the economic crisis.\n\nWe\u2019d really love for you to sign our open letter:\n\n-   [Fix CNBC!](http://fixcnbc.com/a)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://fixcnbc.com/a", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/16/economists-progresses-pet_n_175249.html", "http://fixcnbc.com/a"], "time": 1237186800.0, "postid": "fixcnbc", "internal_links": []}, "deadsociologist": {"post_title": "Slaves of Some Dead Sociologist", "tags": [], "post_content": "Slaves of Some Dead Sociologist\n===============================\n\nApril 15, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/deadsociologist)\n\n* * * * *\n\nImagine you were suddenly put in charge of Google.

(If your legal team decides\nto give up the names of Chinese dissidents to the secret police, that\u2019s\ngoing to hurt your brand.) Product design? Clearly this is also\nimportant, but at a company the size of Google it\u2019s too big a job for\none person \u2014 most of Google\u2019s innovative new products are designed by\nrank-and-file engineers. Strategy? This is a good one, and probably what\nGoogle\u2019s current rulers spend most of their time on, but I\u2019m skeptical\nas to how good anyone can really be at long-term strategy with such a\nhuge company. Hiring? Obviously hiring is pretty important, but even the\ngreatest group of people aren\u2019t going to save your company if they waste\ntheir time once their inside.\n\nNo, I think the most important thing a person in charge of a large\ncompany can work on is sociology \u2014 designing the social structure of the\ncompany. It\u2019s the sociology that determines who gets hired, what their\nlife is like, how much freedom they have, what sorts of things they work\non, etc. Clearly these structures determine an enormous amount about the\ncorporation. And yet, strikingly, I\u2019ve never heard of a single\ncorporation that has a high-level group devoted to studying and\nimproving them.\n\n\u201cPractical men,\u201d Keynes famously wrote at [the end of his *General\nTheory*](http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch24.htm),\n\u201cwho believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual\ninfluences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\u201d And\nsociology seems to have worked out much the same way. [Chandler\nclaims](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visiblehand) that the modern\ncommand-and-control corporation was worked out just about identically by\nseveral different people around the same time and its military methods\nhave been with us ever since.\n\nDespite enormous changes in the kinds of things big companies do as well\nas in the way that they do them, the actual structure of the large\ncorporation (with very few exceptions) has hardly changed at all. It\u2019s\ngotten to the point where even tinkering with the cubicle seems radical.\n\nSince such questions are so alien, let me give a sense of the questions\nI mean. For example, how do you hire? Right now, it appears that at\nGoogle each team gets to hire people for its projects and then once\nyou\u2019re inside Google you get to switch to another project if you like.\nWhy not have a team dedicated to hiring which tries to find the best way\nto pick the best people as well as making sure they match a particular\ncompany culture?\n\nAlso, how do projects get picked? Do you have a command-and-control\nstructure deciding what things need to get worked on from the top? Do\nyou let everybody work on what they like? Do you let the company vote on\nwhat its priorities should be?\n\nWhat do you do with people who don\u2019t work out? Do you have performance\nreviews? Bonus pay? Three-strikes firing offenses? Or do all these\nsystems just make working more frightening and problematic?\n\nIt seems to me any reasonable company ought to have a whole department\ndedicated to working on these issues, studying the systems that are in\nplace, studying the kinds of things that others have tried, and doing\ntheir own experiments to see if they can do things better. And yet, to\nmy knowledge, no one does. Even the handful of companies that do\nsomething innovative with their corporate structure did it as a one-off\n\u2014 they have no team dedicated to coming up with and trying new such\ninnovations.\n\nNow normally when you discover that everyone else is doing something\nwrong, there\u2019s an opportunity for you to get ahead by doing it right.\nBut that\u2019s much more difficult here, because these questions only really\nmake sense for large organizations and very few of us find ourselves in\ncharge of large organizations. For example, its arguable that [Fog\nCreek](http://www.fogcreek.com/About.html) has done some things along\nthese lines, but it\u2019s pretty difficult to tell since they\u2019ve never had\nmore than a couple dozen people.\n\nInstead, the real innovation hasn\u2019t come from companies, but the online\npeer-production projects, like GNU/Linux, that take contributions from a\ndistributed set of volunteer contributors. But such groups solve the\nproblem largely through eliminating it \u2014 they don\u2019t have to worry about\nwho to hire and how to treat them because they don\u2019t hire anyone.\n\nInstead, most of the people who work on GNU/Linux are hired by other\ncompanies where they must contend with the antiquated social structures\nthat those companies provide. And since those are the brutal facts that\nmost humans must contend with, it would be nice if more people were\nthinking about alternatives.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch24.htm", "http://www.fogcreek.com/About.html"], "time": 1208242800.0, "postid": "deadsociologist", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visiblehand"]}, "banff": {"post_title": "Banff", "tags": [], "post_content": "Banff\n=====\n\nMarch 16, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/banff)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![Banff\nStorms](image1_banff)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342213374/ \"Banff Storms by AaronSw, on Flickr\")\n\nWhen you step off the plane in Calgary, there are, rather improbably,\nmen in cowboy hats. Albertans consistently refer to their province as\n\u201cthe Texas of Canada\u201d and apparently its largest city has taken the\nnotion to heart.\n\nI take a ride with a man who appears to have spent his life preparing to\nbe the consummate businessman. His handshake is firm, his knowledge of\ngeopolitics impeccable. He is a master of the telling anecdote, the\ncommanding voice, the comprehensive but guarded answer. He has built\nplanes, been in bands, managed corporate strategy, and now he is on\nassignment in Mexico, where he must staff up a factory to build planes\nfor a Canadian business that is wary of such \u201coffshoring\u201d.\n\nHe has gone, he explains, from a life in which he researches\ntechnicalities for position papers on corporate strategy to one life in\nwhich he gets up every morning, drives to a factory, locks the doors (to\npunish latecomers), walks the line, and tries to figure out how to get\nairplanes built and delivered.\n\nAs we drive, he demonstrates his radio contact to the folks back home in\nMexico. Right now they are trying to figure out how to get a plane body\nthey have built from Mexico to Canada in time for additional\nconstruction to begin on Monday morning without breaking any laws in the\ncomplicated patchwork of trucking regulations.\n\nI feel endlessly inferior to this confident man of business, until I\ndiscover he knows very little about technology or copyright law. He does\nunderstand, however, that Google must be very popular, as he visits it\n\u201cat least two or three times a day\u201d. I try to contribute something back\nby attempting to explain some things about the subject, although I talk\ntoo fast and don\u2019t explain enough, so I\u2019m not sure much was clear.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt is a long drive past a short skyline to Banff, a city that literally\nresides inside a national park, one which requires a permit to enter and\nin which no new construction is permitted.\n\nTourism most certainly is, however, and the city is dotted with hotels\nand conference centers nestled into the sides of imposing mountains,\nwith glorious vistas in all directions. The hotel I am staying at is\nalmost comically opulent, with a Roaring 20s theme of sparkling black\ngowns amidst weak white art deco lights. My room is huge.\n\n[![Empty\nRoom](image2_banff)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342213092/ \"Empty Room by AaronSw, on Flickr\")\n\nAt check in I am given my badge and binder and hat and vest. There is a\nparty that night at the bar. I want to soak up the discussions, to see\nhow the elite live and what they discuss, but I am too shy to barge into\nany of the conversations. It is just like any other party: I sit against\nthe wall and try to remain inconspicuous.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next morning I am scheduled to give a brief talk to this\nself-described group of \u201cyoung leaders\u201d of Canada. Taking the stage\nafter the platitudes of a high-ranking Albertan government official, I\nfind myself on a panel on \u201cthe Internet and Mass Collaboration\u201d (the one\ntechnology panel at the conference) and am asked to give five minutes of\nprovocative thoughts. In a bright red t-shirt amongst a sea of suits, I\napproach the podium:\n\n> I suppose I\u2019m here to be the brash young person from San Francisco.\n> I\u2019ll try my best to fill that role. For years I\u2019ve been a user and a\n> builder of these technologies. Most recently, I co-founded Reddit, a\n> democratic news site which was purchased by the magazine publisher\n> Cond\u00e9 Nast, and I am now working on Open Library, an attempt to create\n> a Wikipedia for books. [\u2026]\n>\n> There\u2019s a lot of talk, here and elsewhere, about how Internet\n> collaboration is going to revolutionize business and politics. Just\n> add some Internet collaboration, they say, and your business will\n> suddenly start working better and smarter\u2014and cheaper, as well. But\n> the Internet is not this magic pixie dust you can sprinkle on\n> anything. In the States, the back of every ketchup bottle now has a\n> notice explaining that you can now create your own advertisements for\n> the ketchup company. In return, well, in return they might use your\n> ad. This is magic pixie dust thinking at work: people are not going to\n> suddenly start designing your ad campaigns for you just because you\n> asked them to.\n>\n> We have to remember that these things are done by real people, not\n> magical abstractions. The rhetoric often suggests that some magical\n> force of \u201cpeer production\u201d or \u201cmass collaboration\u201d has written an\n> encyclopedia or created a video library. Such forces do not exist;\n> instead there are only individual people, the same kind of people who\n> drive everything else.\n>\n> The power is that these people are collaborating. But they are\n> collaborating because they have come together to form a community. And\n> a community works because it has shared values. But here\u2019s the thing:\n> these shared values are profoundly anti-business. [Laughs from the\n> audience.] I mean, look at Wikipedia. This is a group who wakes up\n> every day and tries to put the encyclopedia publishers out of business\n> by providing a collection of world knowledge they can give away to\n> everyone for free.\n>\n> If you want someone to do your company\u2019s work for you, finding a\n> well-organized online community with strong anti-business values seems\n> like a bad idea. [Laughs.]\n>\n> So what do you do? I have a friend who is even more brash than I am\n> and when anyone asks her for business advice she tells them simply:\n> Well, in the future, your servants are going to rise up and eat you.\n> So, invest in toothpicks.\n\nI quickly scurry back to my seat, afraid this crowd will rise up and eat\nme for such brazen aggressiveness. But instead, I am cheered with\nlaughter and applause. Nobody ever addresses my toothpicks comment. For\nthe next hour, me and the rest of the panel answer questions from the\naudience, and I comfortably talk about everything from the gender gap in\ntechnology (which, I assure them, is worse than in any other field and a\nresult of the most disgusting discrimination and misogyny) to the future\nof news (freelancers and aggregators, not institutions).\n\nAfterward, and for the next few days, dozens of people come up to\ncompliment me on my talk. \u201cSo you do this sort of thing a lot then?\u201d\nthey all say. I receive three more speaking invitations before lunch and\npeople repeatedly request to sit next to me at meals.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![Michael\nGeist](image3_banff)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2341384145/ \"Michael Geist by AaronSw, on Flickr\")\n\nI spend a great deal of time with Michael Geist and his family. Geist is\ninvariably referred to as \u201cthe Lawrence Lessig of Canada\u201d. A law\nprofessor in the country\u2019s capital, he writes a weekly column and gives\nfrequent speeches on technology policy (copyright law, net neutrality,\nopen spectrum, etc.). But unlike Lessig, who has an otherworldly aura of\nfame about him, Geist is entirely down-to-earth, continually expressing\ngenuine shock at how boneheaded and awful his opponents in industry and\ngovernment are. While I spend most of the rest of the time explaining\nthings to people, I have to work hard to avoid doing that with Geist \u2014\nhe either knows intimately or has actually worked on every relevant\nthing I can think to mention.\n\nAfter our panel is a panel on work-life balance, mostly dominated by\nJames Milway, director of the Institute for Competiveness and\nProsperity. There are two other women on the panel to balance him, but\nMilway speaks with such booming confidence and authority that the other\npanelists comments seem to just disappear. Milway says everything you\u2019d\nexpect a right-wing economist to say: Canadians aren\u2019t working hard\nenough, they\u2019re not working long enough, they keep spending time doing\nsilly things like increasing the minimum wage and engaging in rent\ncontrol which are just obviously wrong. Increasing vacation time will\njust lead to fewer workers getting hired. This is all clear in our\nregressions. Europe\u2019s economies are dying; workers there are far\nunhappier. And so on.\n\nAfterwards I go up to him to argue with his economics. \u201cYou\u2019re using the\nstandard economic assumption that the demand curve for labor slopes\ndownard,\u201d I say. (This is economese for the concept that as you raise\nthe cost of hiring someone, people hire less.) \u201cBut every study on this\nsubject \u2014 from Card and Krueger to Michael Manning \u2014 finds that this\nsimply isn\u2019t the case. Manning\u2019s monsopony model, in which you take into\naccount that there are significant costs to changing jobs, finds that\nall of your results no longer follow.\u201d\n\nMilway is a fast speaker and has boundless energy and he tries to talk\nright over me. \u201cEvery\u2014every\u2014hold on there\u2014every\u2014almost all\u2014there\u2019s a\nstrong consensus in economics that raising the minimum wage is a bad\nidea,\u201d he finally gets out. \u201cSure,\u201d I say, \u201cbut they\u2019re wrong \u2014 when you\nactually look at the studies that\u2019s just not true.\u201d \u201cNo, there\u2019s a\nstrong body of studies\u2014even in our regressions we find that.\u201d We argue\nfor a while about the validity of the Card and Krueger work and he\nfinally asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the argument for the opposite case? Why would\nemployers do that?\u201d I try to explain the Manning model but halfway\nthrough realize I don\u2019t fully understand it. So I switch tacks.\n\n\u201cLook at what Card found when he was doing his research \u2014 employers were\nhappy to raise non-wage benefits to get employees but just refused to\nraise wages, even when more employees would have made them more money.\nThey weren\u2019t being economically rational.\u201d \u201cWell, there you go,\u201d he\nsays, as if he\u2019s won the argument. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think people behave\nrationally then we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut of course people don\u2019t behave rationally!\u201d I squealed. \u201cLook at all\nthe research in behavioral economics \u2014 it\u2019s blatantly obvious people\ndon\u2019t behave rationally.\u201d \u201cWell then, you might as well throw away the\nwhole field of economics!\u201d he shouted. \u201cPrecisely. I\u2019m glad you agree \u2014\neconomics is bogus.\u201d He just laughed and stormed off, but not before\ngiving me a working paper from his institute.\n\nWe ended up sitting near each other at lunch. He was explaining that his\ninstitute was completely funded by the Ontario government but remained\nstrictly independent. \u201cSo how\u2019d you get the government to fund a\nright-wing think tank?\u201d I asked. He laughed. \u201cWell, normally I\u2019d say\nwe\u2019re more middle-of-the-road, but I guess you\u2019re right, we are pretty\nright-wing. I don\u2019t know. Harris [the previous major premier of Ontario]\nstarted us but [the current one] loves us too.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\n![Rory Stewart](image4_banff)\n\nThat night there was a talk by Rory Stewart, the other person I got to\nknow and enjoy at the conference. Stewart is an amazing fellow. An\nincredibly handsome man, with a perfect British accent and the most\nwell-tailored suits, he nonetheless has the look of something\notherworldly about him. His face is pulled back and marked as if he\u2019s\nseen things no one in a suit that nice was meant to see. I adored him\nfrom the first.\n\nHe somehow got it in his head to walk across Afghanistan and his talk\nconsisted of photos and descriptions of this incredible journey. he\nbegun in a major city and walked for years, depending almost entirely on\nthe hospitality of strangers in each town to keep him alive and moving.\nHe walked every day, through deserts and snowstorms, with company and\nwithout. And what he found was an incredibly kind people, living in\nterribly poor conditions in autonomous villages, with a passionate faith\nin their religion (including such rules as keeping women out of site).\n\nStewart now runs an NGO in Kabul, which is doing the work that the\ncoalition forces in the country found too \u201clow-priority\u201d to do: clear\nseven feet of garbage from the streets, build thriving businesses and\nshops in the downtown district, and prepare commercial products for\nimport and export. Stewart spoke bluntly about the military mission and\nthe government, suggesting it was unlikely to do much good.\n\nIt was 11pm by the time the discussion was over, so I went straight to\nbed.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next morning was dedicated to addressing the most pressing issue in\nforeign policy, perhaps overall: whether we should bring the troops home\ninstead of continuing to lose their lives maintaining an increasingly\nviolent occupation in a country we originally invaded under the guise of\nfighting terrorism but in which we now remain because we fear it will\nfall apart if we will leave. This being Canada, that country is\nAfghanistan.\n\nThe day started with a passionate speech by the Afghanistan Minister for\nEducation, who pleaded for us to let the country take control of its own\naffairs and to ensure \u201cits greedy neighbors\u201d (widely agreed to be a\neuphemism for Pakistan) didn\u2019t destroy it.\n\n[![Our Distinguished\nPanel](image5_banff)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342215558/ \"Our Distinguished Panel by AaronSw, on Flickr\")\n\nThen there was a star-studded panel, including Rory Stewart, an Afghani\nPR officer, an Afghani citizen, the head of the entire Canadian Army,\nthe ambassador from Afghanistan, and the head of a Canadian government\ndevelopment agency. (I don\u2019t have the list in front of me, but I believe\nthat\u2019s correct.) It was pretty impressive to see the head of the\nCanadian Army and he was a pretty impressive fellow, equally fluent in\nliterature and philosophy as politics and warfare. But he steadfastly\nrefused to take a position on whether the army should remain in\nAfghanistan, insisting that was a question for the population through\ntheir government. Stewart cleverly began the panel by saying that\neveryone in it had vested interests, including him, and that we should\nwork hard to try to derive the truth from their statements.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt lunch we hear the most amazing presentation. It\u2019s a pitch for, I am\nnot making this up \u201cDevelopment-In-A-Box(TM)\u201d \u2014 a system that (again, I\nam not making this up), uses \u201cpreconfigured solutions \u2026 embedded in\nbusiness processes \u2026 automating compliance \u2026 [with] fully automated \u2026\nwireframes.\u201d (And that\u2019s just the part I managed to record \u2014 the rest of\nit was far worse.) The presentation was complete with completely absurd\nPowerPoint clip art: a cargo crate flying to world hotspots, a hammer\nand sickle flying over a tank riding over an AK-47 pointed at a pile of\nChinese-made goods, all above a 3D banner reading \u201cLess Clausewitz, More\nSun-Tzu\u201d.\n\nAdding to the sense of unreality, the speaker sounded like a broken\nanimatronic Abe Lincoln, placing bizarre emphasis on random words and\nconstantly speaking in a faux-upbeat tone.\n\nThe gist of the proposal was this: come up with a bunch of computer\nprograms and simple rules that can be followed in any country, no matter\nhow badly destroyed, to get its economy up and running so that investors\ncan come in and start taking advantage of it. It was a reasonable idea,\nhe explained, to get the economy started before a democratic government\nwas because that was how history had usually proceeded \u2014 after all, \u201cthe\nUS only let everyone vote like fifty years ago.\u201d\n\nI swear, I would have been convinced the talk was given by the Yes Men\nif it wasn\u2019t quite so bad. Even so, we were half-convinced it was some\nkind of prank. At least now I understand why businessmen kept falling\nfor the Yes Men\u2019s pranks. (To be fair, there was a bunch of pushback.\nNot the least of which came from Rory Stewart, who pointed out that\nentering a wide variety of countries with pre-written rules might not be\nspectacularly effective.)\n\nThere was also a group photo in the mountains and some scheduled trips\naround town, but I neglected to bring a jacket so I mostly stayed inside\nthe hotel, luxuriating in my oversized room and using my overpriced\nInternet connection. But soon enough it was time to catch the bus back\nto Calgary, and then to gritty, working-class San Francisco and the\nliteral view from the ground, not the metaphorical one they need up in\nthe mountains.\n\n[![Banff](image6_banff)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342212674/ \"Banff by AaronSw, on Flickr\")\n\n[image1_banff]: image1_banff.jpg\n[image2_banff]: image2_banff.jpg\n[image3_banff]: image3_banff.jpg\n[image4_banff]: image4_banff.jpg\n[image5_banff]: image5_banff.jpg\n[image6_banff]: image6_banff.jpg", "external_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342213374/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342213092/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2341384145/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342215558/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronsw/2342212674/"], "time": 1205650800.0, "postid": "banff", "internal_links": []}, "breadandcheese": {"post_title": "Bread and Cheese", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bread and Cheese\n================\n\nNovember 23, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/breadandcheese)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt seems like every Western food culture has some combination of bread\nand cheese as a meal.

Everybody except me.\n\nI think following the news is a waste of time.\n\nSome people agree with me on a small scale. Some point out that the\ncable channels are obsessed with bizarre crimes that have little larger\nimpact, that they worry too much about horse-race coverage of politics,\nthat too much of the news is filled with PR-inserted nonsense. But they\ndo this because they think these are aberrations; that underneath all\nthis, the news is worth saving. I simply go one step further: I think\nnone of it is worthwhile.\n\nLet us look at the front page of today\u2019s *New York Times*, the gold\nstandard in news. In the top spot there is a story about Republicans\nfeuding among themselves. There is a photo of soldiers in Iraq. A stock\nexchange chief must return \\$100M. There is a concern about some doctors\nover-selling a nerve testing system. There is a threat from China\nagainst North Korea. There is a report that violence in Iraq is rising.\nAnd there is concern about virtual science classes replacing real ones.\n\nNone of these stories have relevance to my life. Reading them may be\nenjoyable, but it\u2019s an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact\non my actions one way or another.\n\nMost people will usually generally concede this point, but suggest that\nthere\u2019s something virtuous about knowing it anyway, that it makes me a\nbetter citizen. They point out that newspapers are a key part of our\ndemocracy, that by exposing wrong-doing to the people, they force the\nwrong-doers to stop.\n\nThis seems to be true, but the curious thing is that I\u2019m never involved.\nThe government commits a crime, the *New York Times* prints it on the\nfront page, the people on the cable chat shows foam at the mouth about\nit, the government apologizes and commits the crime more subtly. It\u2019s a\nvaluable system \u2014 I certainly support the government being more subtle\nabout committing crimes (well, for the sake of argument, at least) \u2014 but\nyou notice how it never involves me? It seems like the whole thing would\nwork just as well even if nobody ever read the *Times* or watched the\ncable chat shows. It\u2019s a closed system.\n\nThere is voting, of course, but to become an informed voter all one\nneeds to do is read a short guide about the candidates and issues before\nthe election. There\u2019s no need to have to suffer through the daily\nback-and-forth of allegations and counter-allegations, of scurrilous\nlies and their refutations. Indeed, reading a voter\u2019s guide is much\nbetter: there\u2019s no recency bias (where you only remember the crimes\nreported in the past couple months), you get to hear both sides of the\nstory after the investigation has died down, you can actually think\nabout the issues instead of worrying about the politics.\n\nOthers say that sure, most of the stuff in the news isn\u2019t of use, but\noccasionally you\u2019ll come across some story that will lead you to\nactually change what you\u2019ve been working on. But really, how plausible\nis this? Most people\u2019s major life changes don\u2019t come from reading an\narticle in the newspaper; they come from reading longer-form essays or\nthoughtful books, which are much more convincing and detailed.\n\nWhich brings me to my second example of people agreeing with me on the\nsmall scale. You\u2019ll often hear TV critics say that CNN\u2019s\nup-to-the-minute reporting is absurd. Instead of saying, \u201cWe have\nunconfirmed reports that\u2014This just in! We now have confirmed reports\nthat those unconfirmed reports have been denied. No, wait! There\u2019s a new\nreport denying the confirmation of the denial of the unconfirmed\nreport.\u201d and giving viewers whiplash, they suggest that the reporters\nsimply wait until a story is confirmed before reporting it and do\ncommentary in the meantime.\n\nBut if that\u2019s true on a scale of minutes, why longer? Instead of\nwatching hourly updates, why not read a daily paper? Instead of reading\nthe back and forth of a daily, why not read [a weekly\nreview](http://harpers.org/WeeklyReview.html)? Instead of a weekly\nreview, why not read a monthly magazine? Instead of a monthly magazine,\nwhy not read an annual book?\n\nWith the time people waste reading a newspaper every day, they could\nhave read an entire book about most subjects covered and thereby learned\nabout it with far more detail and far more impact than the daily doses\nthey get dribbled out by the paper. But people, of course, wouldn\u2019t read\na book about most subjects covered in the paper, because most of them\nare simply irrelevant.\n\nBut finally, I\u2019d like to argue that following the news isn\u2019t just a\nwaste of time, it\u2019s actively unhealthy. Edward Tufte notes that when he\nused to read the *New York Times* in the morning, it scrambled his brain\nwith so many different topics that he couldn\u2019t get any real intellectual\nwork done the rest of the day.\n\nThe news\u2019s obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide\nvariety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects\nwrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the\ncorrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors\nthat must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the\nnews will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its\nobsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting\npeople. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less\nreflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.\n\nThis is not simply an essay meant to provoke; I genuinely believe what I\nwrite. I have not followed the news at least since I was 13 (with\noccasional lapses on particular topics). My life does not seem to be\nimpoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been greatly enhanced. But I\nhaven\u2019t found many other people who are willing to take the plunge.\n", "external_links": ["http://harpers.org/WeeklyReview.html"], "time": 1161327600.0, "postid": "hatethenews", "internal_links": []}, "intentionalevil": {"post_title": "The Intentionality of Evil", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Intentionality of Evil\n==========================\n\nJune 23, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intentionalevil)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[ **English** | [\u4e2d\u6587](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/intentionalevil.zh) |\n[Deutsch](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/intentionalevil.de) ]\n\nAs children we\u2019re fed a steady diet of comic books (and now, movies\nbased off of them) in which brave heros save the planet from evil\npeople. It\u2019s become practically conventional wisdom that such stories\nwrongly make the line between good and evil too clear \u2014 the world is\nmore nuanced than that, we\u2019re told \u2014 but this isn\u2019t actually the problem\nwith these stories. The problem is that the villains *know* they\u2019re\nevil.\n\nAnd people really grow up thinking things work this way: evil people\nintentionally do evil things. But this just doesn\u2019t happen. Nobody\nthinks they\u2019re doing evil \u2014 maybe because it\u2019s just impossible to be\nintentionally evil, maybe because it\u2019s easier and more effective to\nconvince yourself you\u2019re good \u2014 but every major villain had some\njustification to explain why what they were doing was good. *Everybody*\nthinks they\u2019re good.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, then intentionality doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s\nno defense to say (to take a recently famous example) that New York\nbankers were just doing their jobs, convinced that they were helping the\npoor or something, because everybody thinks they\u2019re just doing their\njobs; Eichmann thought he was just doing his job.\n\nEichmann, of course, is the right example because it was Hannah Arendt\u2019s\nbook *Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil* that is\nfamously cited for this thesis. Eichmann, like almost all terrorists and\nkillers, was by our standards a perfectly normal and healthy guy doing\nwhat he thought were perfectly reasonable things.\n\nAnd if that normal guy could do it, so could we. And while we could\nargue who\u2019s worse \u2014 them or us \u2014 it\u2019s a pointless game since its *our*\nactions that we\u2019re responsible for.

After the significant 2001 recession, the economy had\nbegun growing again, with increasing growth in America\u2019s economic\noutput, or GDP. But, unlike the growth in the Clinton years, the extra\nmoney being made in America wasn\u2019t going to the average person. Instead,\nas the economy grew, the wages for the average person stagnated or even\ndeclined. All the extra money was going to the people at the very top.\n\nIn the press, President Bush\u2019s supporters complained that the public\nwasn\u2019t more happy about the growing economy Bush had given them. After\nall, he\u2019d pulled the country out of a recession; normally that\u2019s good\nfor a boost in the polls. Sadly, Americans were just too dumb to notice,\nBush\u2019s supporters concluded. If only they paid more attention to the\nnews. But what these people \u201care really urging,\u201d Krugman explained in\nhis talk, \u201cis not that the public should be smart, but that the public\nshould be medium\nstupid.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/krugman-final.pdf)\n\nIf the public was really \u201cstupid\u201d (i.e. uneducated), it wouldn\u2019t watch\nthe news at all. Instead, it would notice it was out of work,\npoorly-paid, or otherwise having trouble making ends meet, and conclude\nthat the economy wasn\u2019t doing very well. On the other hand, if the\npublic was really smart, it\u2019d dig deep into the numbers to find that \u2014\nsurprise, surprise! \u2014 for most people, the economy wasn\u2019t doing as well\nas the headline numbers about GDP growth would suggest. The only way for\nthe public to buy the Bush administration spin is to be medium stupid.\n\nThe medium stupid idea has much wider applicability. Most specifically,\nit explains the general state that the mainstream media tries to\ninculcate in the public. The uneducated American has a general idea that\ninvading other countries is probably a bad idea. The overeducated\nAmerican can point to dozens of examples of why this is going to be a\nbad idea. But the \u201cmedium stupid\u201d American, the kind that gullibly reads\nthe *New York Times* and watches the *CBS Evening News*, is convinced\nthat Iraq is full of weapons of mass destruction that could blow our\ncountry to bits at any minute. A little education can be a dangerous\nthing.\n\n(Along these lines, at one point I was working on a documentary film\nabout the evening news that would demonstrate this point. The title,\n*Medium Stupid*, would also be a convenient homage to *Medium Cool*.)\n\nThe same is true in school. As Christopher Hayes points out in his\ngenius article, [Is A Little Economics A Dangerous\nThing?](http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/2897/), the\nuneducated American thinks raising the minimum wage is a pretty good\nidea \u2014 after all, people deserve to be paid more than \\$5 an hour. And\nthe overeducated American feels the same way; like the dozens of\nEconomics Prize winners who signed a petition to raise the minimum wage,\nthey\u2019ve seen the studies showing that raising the minimum wage has only\na negligible effect on employment. But those who have only had Economics\n101 buy the propaganda that government interference in the market will\nonly make things worse. And, [as Hayes\nshows](http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/2897/), this leads\nto bad decisions in many areas \u2014 the minimum wage being only one\nprominent example.\n\nThe medium stupid idea has applicability in other areas of life. The\nuncultured person who knows nothing about fashion doesn\u2019t mind wandering\naround in jeans and a t-shirt. And the overcultured person knows exactly\nwhat to wear to be hip. But medium stupid ol\u2019 me looks bad and feels bad\nabout it.\n\nTo work, propaganda, be it from the Bush administration or the fashion\nindustry, requires you to be medium stupid. Know too little and you\nnever hear the falsehoods. Know too much and you can spot it for a\nfraud.

Ever since Hal ate the\nmold as a child, he\u2019s been a brilliant communicator but unable to feel.\n(694: \u201cHal himself hasn\u2019t had a bona fide\nintensity-of-interior-life-type emotion since he was tiny \u2026 in fact he\u2019s\nfar more robotic than John Wayne.\u201d) JOI was the only one who could see\nit. In life, everyone thought JOI was just being crazy but in death (as\na wraith) he can actually read Hal\u2019s thoughts and thus confirm his view.\n\nIn life he created the Entertainment to draw Hal out (Hal moves\noutwardly but doesn\u2019t feel inside; victims of the Entertainment\nfeel\u2014something\u2014inside but don\u2019t move outwardly). After all, as he tells\nGately, he was willing to resort to desperate measures: \u201cNo! *No!* *Any*\nconversation or interchange [between father and son] is better than none\nat all.\u201d (839)\n\nJOI\u2019s wraith is responsible for the strange disturbances around ETA \u2014\ntripods in the forest, moving Ortho\u2019s bed, ceiling tiles on the floor.\nHe knocks the ceiling tiles down in an attempt to find the DMZ. Pemulis\nis too distracted with getting expelled to have Hal take it, so JOI\nneeds to get it to Hal some other way.\n\nJOI also created DMZ as part of an attempt to undo the effects of Hal\u2019s\neating mold as a child (recall: DMZ is a mold that grows on a mold). He\nleft it along with the Entertainment (recall: ETA kids find JOI\u2019s\npersonal effects (670: \u201ca bulky old doorless microwave\u2026a load of old TP\ncartridges\u2026mostly unlabelled\u201d); the tapes and the DMZ are delivered\ntogether to the FLQ) which is about this goal (it stars a woman named\nMadame Psychosis (a street name for DMZ) explaining that the thing that\nkilled you in your last life will give birth to you in the next). The\nDMZ and the Entertainment were meant to go together for Hal. Now that\nthe Entertainment has escaped, he needs to get Hal the DMZ.\n\nHal never leaves leaves his toothbrush unattended (870), but that\u2019s no\nproblem for a wraith. He places the DMZ on Hal\u2019s brush and Hal brushes\nhis teeth (860) and immediately begins experiencing symptoms: Ortho\nthinks Hal\u2019s crying when Hal thinks he\u2019s speaking in a neutral tone\n(862).\n\nHal\u2019s symptoms indeed begin to reverse: he is now unable to properly\ncommunicate feelings (people see him as either laughing hysterically or\nterribly sad) but beginning to actually feel (like Gately, he spends a\nlot of time lying on the floor thinking about the past \u2014 the hero of\nnonaction from his essay (142)). While before, everyone could hear him\n*except* JOI; now *only* JOI can hear him (since, as with Gately, he can\nhear Hal\u2019s thoughts).\n\nBy the time of the match, his symptoms are so bad he\u2019s taken by\nambulance to the hospital (16: \u201cthe only other emergency room I have\never been in [was] almost exactly one year back\u201d), safely escaping the\nA.F.R.\u2019s assault. Like fellow student Otis P. Lord, he gets the bed next\nto Gately. Joelle (who is at the hospital for a meeting) visits Gately\non her way out and recognizes Hal. She tells them both about the hunt\nfor the lethal Entertainment and the resulting Continental Emergency and\nthey all go to dig up JOI\u2019s grave. They persuade John Wayne, a spy for\nthe A.F.R., to become a double agent and help sneak them into JOI\u2019s\nQuebec burial site. Wayne presumably tells the A.F.R. he is actually a\ntriple agent \u2014 that he will steal the tape as soon as Hal digs it up.\nBut, as with Marathe, his loyalties are ultimately even-numbered (n40).\nThe A.F.R. finds out and brutally murders him, which is why he can\u2019t win\nthe WhataBurger (16f).\n\nAs Gately forsees:\n\n> he\u2019s with a very sad kid and they\u2019re in a graveyard digging some dead\n> guy\u2019s head up and it\u2019s really important, like Continental-Emergency\n> important, and Gately\u2019s the best digger but he\u2019s wicked hungry, like\n> irresistibly hungry, and he\u2019s eating with both hands out of huge\n> economy-size bags of corporate snacks so he can\u2019t really dig, while it\n> gets later and later and the sad kid is trying to scream at Gately\n> that the important thing was buried in the guy\u2019s head and to divert\n> the Continental Emergency to start digging the guy\u2019s head up before\n> it\u2019s too late, but the kid moves his mouth but nothing comes out, and\n> Joelle van D. appears \u2026 while the sad kid holds something terrible up\n> by the hair and makes the face of somebody shouting in panic: *Too\n> Late*. (934)\n\nIt\u2019s too late because someone got there first and took the\nanti-Entertainment cartridge (126) embedded in JOI\u2019s head (31). Whoever\ntook it is presumably the person who\u2019s made and mailed the extant\ncopies. It couldn\u2019t be the A.F.R. or O.U.S. or they wouldn\u2019t still be\nsearching for it. It probably wasn\u2019t the F.L.Q. because they didn\u2019t know\nhow to read master cartridges\u2014they just thought they were blank tapes in\ntheir displays were blank.

For those out there interested in\nthe question, Rick Perlstein (author of *Before the Storm*, the\nhighly-praised history of the rise of the Republican right) has written\nwhat is pretty much the definitive piece on the subject, now in\npaperback as *The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo*.\n\nIn short: Perlstein recounts the strong evidence that there is very\nbroad support for the economic platform of the Democrats. Nonvoters,\nindependents, and even Republicans, he notes, support core Democratic\nprinciples. They just don\u2019t consider themselves Democrats, a party they\nthink of as not standing for anything in particular. This is, of course,\nbecause Democrats have been busy chasing after the mirage of swing\nvoters, running further and further to the right, following the ball\nRepublicans are glefully pulling in front of them.\n\nHe argues that instead, the Democrats must build a strong and long-term\npolitical identity, building a new political landscape instead of trying\nto win on the old one, just as the right-wing Republicans did.

The talk was titled \u201cConsciousness, Creativity, and the\nBrain\u201d. I didn\u2019t know why a movie director would have any particular\ninsights on these subjects but I decided that at the least it would be\namusing.\n\nThe talk was held in a huge and beautiful theater in downtown Boston,\nornate with two large balconies and, from where I was sitting at least,\nlargely full. We were all handed free DVDs on the way in as well as\n\u201cmore information\u201d forms with beautiful typography. The form were headed\n\u201cThe David Lynch Educational Foundation For Consciousness-Raising\nEducation And World Peace\u201d. (The \u201cAnd World Peace\u201d seems like it should\nbe a joke.) The dean of the college introduced the event by droning on\nabout how great Emerson College was. I tuned out but the people I went\nwith told me he gave the standard distancing-himself-from-the-event\nspeech, something about how they provided a range of voices to encourage\nthe students (profound voice:) \u201cto quest, and to question\u201d.\n\nThen the president of the David Lynch Foundation came up and introduced\nDavid Lynch, who apparently didn\u2019t have a talk prepared and just took\nsome questions from the audience. I suspect some of the questions were\nplants, because they sounded so suspiciously knowledgeable about\nmeditation, but maybe all the local meditators were attracted to the\nevent.\n\nIn photographs, Lynch looks like an old British dude who would have a\ndeep and thoughtful voice. Instead, his voice is high and squeaky and\nsort of gimmicky-sounding, which also made it hard to take him\nseriously. He finished up and the Foundation president came back to\nintroduce Dr. John Haeglin, who he presented as one of the leading\nphysicists of our day. And where does this great mind work? The\nMaharishi University of Management, although the announcer cleverly\npronounced this so it sounded like \u201cMurshy University\u201d, which is more\nplausible as an actual school. The Maharishi University of Management\n(MUM), however, is a phony organization set up the Maharishi Mahesh\nYogi, who claims that he can fly. (The Maharishi, you may recall, also\nseduced The Beatles. Their later disappointment was the source of the\nsong \u201cSexy Sadie\u201d, which was originally titled \u201cMaharishi\u201d.)\n\nHaeglin is the Maharishi\u2019s main man in the US, running for president on\nthe Maharishi\u2019s political party (the Natural Law Party), which almost\nreceived federal funds from Perot\u2019s Reform Party, although it narrowly\nlost to Pat Buchanan. (I had my Sidekick with me, so I looked all this\nup on the Web while I was listening.) Haeglin had a tricky job ahead of\nhim. He had to explain to the audience that practicing the Maharishi\u2019s\nTranscendental Meditation (TM) would send out a magical field that would\nmake everybody nearby happy and peaceful. But he also had to do so in\nsuch a way that this audience of college kids, didn\u2019t just break out\nlaughing. The answer: science.\n\nHaeglin gave some reasonably-accurate descriptions of recent innovations\nin Physics, noting that reductionism had caused us to realize that the\nsuperficial diversity asked an underlying uniformity of, he claimed,\nvibrating strings (string theory) that connect all of us together. Now\nHaeglin thinks that TM will cause happy feelings to be transmitted\nthrough the strings into nearby people. But even this seems too absurd,\nso he changes tacks and tries to explain it in a common sense way. \u2018If\neverybody is fearful and scared,\u2019 he says, \u2018you can sort of feel it in\nthe air and you start to be scared. But if everyone is happy, then it\u2019s\njust the opposite. TM works in the same way \u2014 it puts happiness in the\nair.\u2019 He never directly connected this to his comments about string\ntheory and I didn\u2019t really see it until I reflected on it later.\n\nHaeglin has done several \u201cscientific\u201d tests, claiming that a group of\nmeditators can lower the crime rate, although when actual scientists\nchecked some of his numbers, they found he had fabricated the crime rate\nstatistics. And David Lynch explained that the goal of his foundation is\nto raise \\$7 billion so they can provide Transcendental Meditation in\nevery school. (The David Lynch Foundation\u2019s website claims that TM can\ncure classroom stress, clinical depression, learning disorders, high\nblood pressure, and academic underachievement \u2014 oh, right, and cause\nworld peace.\n\nThen he introduced a Dr. Fred Travis, also from MUM, who proceeded to do\nan EEG of some kid\u2019s brain right on stage. He showed some diagrams of\nthe brain, insisting it had a \u201cCEO\u201d which told the rest of it what to\ndo. Normally, he said, the brain\u2019s pieces all scurry about doing\nwhatever they feel like. But Transcendental Meditation strengthens your\nCEO so he can get all the pieces of the brain working together, doing\nwhatever the CEO wants them to do. He demonstrated this by showing the\nboy\u2019s brainwaves normally: all over the place, doing different things.\nThen he asked the boy to meditate and zoomed in on two brain waves,\nwhich started moving in tandem. What this has to do with anything\nremains a mystery to me.\n\nThen Lynch came out and took some more questions. Nobody called him on\nthis nonsense (I was tempted to, but didn\u2019t).

From my\ndesk in my old home in suburban Chicago, you see the same trees, but\nbehind them is asphalt and McMansion and long twisting driveways.\n\nNo one here uses public transportation. The city does have a train\nstation, but one gets the sense that its purpose is mostly decorative \u2014\ntrain stations remind people of the imaginary small town life that\nsuburbs attempt to imitate. To get out to your house, you instead drive\ndown long stretches of drab gray highway, besotted by hideous billboards\nand lined with ugly office parks.\n\nThe weather is certainly nice. On most days, if you go for a walk it\u2019s\nquite beautiful \u2014 as long as you keep your head pointed at the sky,\nwhere the bright green leaves interweave with the brilliant blue. But as\nsoon as you look down there are SUVs driving the wealthy to their\nhalf-hidden palazzos \u2014 just enough visible to be bragging, just enough\nhidden to be private.\n\nWhereas in Cambridge the ambitious try to fill their houses with books,\nin suburbia you go for art and interior decorating. The tasteless fill\ntheir houses with large marble staircases and glistening chandeliers;\nthe more tasteful prefer bright white rooms accented with sculptures and\npictures \u2014 specific enough not to be intellectual, but abstract enough\nto be *art*.\n\nYou came back here to raise a family, but you wouldn\u2019t even consider\nsending them to public school. Why would you, when there\u2019s a perfectly\ngood private school just twenty minutes away? There the kids are white\nand wealthy. After all, how could they be anything else at these tuition\nprices? The school does give out scholarships, but only based on\n\u201cmerit\u201d: \u201cinterviews, teacher recommendations, examination results and\ncurrent school records\u201d. The school is in the wealthiest zip code in\nAmerica, surrounded by trees and houses, like everything else in\nsuburbia.\n\nThe school is preparing for graduation. You see a slide show of those\nabout to receive their diplomas, seen when they\u2019re so young that the\nsmiles leap off their faces. How could anything so precious be unhappy\nhere, with everything in its right place? Afterwards the families mingle\nin the courtyards, surrounded by the gleaming metal of the newly-built\nextensions.\n\nNot too far, another group of kids hides behind trees by the parking\nlot, protecting a cooler full of water balloons they use to pelt their\nfellow students as they try to reach their cars. One kid, his yellow\ncountry-club sweater tied around his neck, complimenting his finessed\nblond hair, hides behind a glass door, fear visible in his eyes as he\nlooks at his newly-purchased convertible and prays it won\u2019t get hit. (He\nbought it, the kids explain, to match his new girlfriend. Then they turn\nand pelt two girls walking by.)\n\nDespite their brazen acts, the kids are quite afraid \u2014 afraid of getting\ncaught. They hide at the sight of parents or teachers and they restrain\nthemselves from hitting the head of school\u2019s daughter. But they needn\u2019t\nworry. Parents see right through the charade and laugh it off. *Oh kids,\noh kids and their water balloons. How delightful!* they say to\nthemselves as they scurry to their cars.\n\nThe kids were right to guard the parking lots; not only is suburbia\nunmanageable without a car, driving cars is a central part of the\nculture: what kind, at what age, and where to? The funny thing is that\nthere simply aren\u2019t that many places to go. There\u2019s your house, and your\nfriends, and the shops uptown or at the mall.\n\nNot that there\u2019s much difference between the two anymore. The malls have\nbecome open-air and the town centers have become so desiccated that\nthey\u2019re little different, just chain shops surrounded by fake walkways\nto other chain shops. The difference, I suppose, is that in town centers\nno one uses the walkways \u2014 why bother when you can drive?\n\nWhile the kids enjoy their eating and shopping, the mothers get down to\nbusiness at the grocery store, a menagerie of food and drink and color.\nHuge carts are filled and paid for and then passed off to low-wage\nMexicans, who load them in your car as you drive out of the parking lot.\n\nIn between the malls and downtown, even the fakery disappears and the\nraw commercialism that pervades the suburb is left naked, assuming its\ndefault form of ugly highway signs and strip malls, all in an almost\nnausea inducing gray, stretching out in all directions, leaving little\nescape.\n\nNot all the people of the suburbs are cold and vicious as their\nsurroundings. For the most part, they\u2019re \u201cliberals\u201d, the kind who are\ndeeply affected by the plight of the homeless as they head back to their\nminivan. A small sign at the menagerie of a grocery store draws\nattention to the plight of the hungry. No, you don\u2019t have to feed them;\njust feel bad: the sign advertises [\u201cnational hunger awareness\nday\u201d](http://www.hungerday.org/) (sponsored, the web site says, \u201cby many\nprominent organizations\u201d \u2014 organizations like Macy\u2019s, Southwest\nAirlines, and the Food Marketing Institute).\n\nAfter all, this is the generation of the New Left. 25 miles south,\nChicago was rocked by the \u201868 Democratic Convention, where kids charged\nthe city while filmed by newscameras, before the Chicago police decided\nto start beating up on both. The suburbanites didn\u2019t participate, of\ncourse, but they watched it on the news and felt sympathy for their\nbrethren and invited the indicted Chicago 7 up to give a talk.\n\nThe war is now Iraq, not Vietnam, and the protest is more muted. A\nsculpture in the town center draws attention to our dead servicemen,\nwhile old ladies occasionally stage protests with large signs. Now the\nantiestablishment kids have become establishment parents, Mayor Daleys\nof their own households, full of tensions no less visible than those\nwhich engulfed Chicago.\n\nSon one plays music too loud for son two who insists that right this\nminute he needs to play a video game. And when these fighting factions\nare supposed to come together, as in a graduation, the tensions boil\nover, parents screeching at kids who scream at each other, dragged down\nto the car where they argue about which windows to open and settings for\nthe AC, until, realizing that they\u2019re all stuck there together, tensions\ncool down somewhat. Still, it doesn\u2019t seem like much fun for anyone.\n\nAt the graduation, everyone has a camera to immortalize this precious\nmoment. They force everyone into straightening their rarely-worn suits\nand dresses and smiling in rarely-seen ways so that the camera can\n\u201ccapture the moment\u201d, an instant of artifice, entirely yanked from time,\nits history completely erased so that the fake smiles may be preserved.\n\nThe graduation itself is a whole event of such artifice: the students\nare trained to walk down the aisles absurdly slowly (while the organist\nstretches Pomp and Circumstance far, far beyond the breaking point) so\nthat every parent may get copious photos of them standing in the aisle.\nOnce on stage they fake their love for teachers they hated only days\nago, while dressed in fake costumes and standing in front of a fake set.\nThe parents are given programs whose professional typography hides the\nnormal disarray of school, makes them think this place is Professional.\n\nOh, the absurdity of it all: putting all that effort into making\nmemories they won\u2019t remember of good times they never had.\n\nBut I guess that\u2019s suburbia \u2014 the fake coat of paint that lets you\npretend your unhappy life is just as nice as everyone else\u2019s, even if it\neasily flakes off.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.hungerday.org/"], "time": 1150441200.0, "postid": "suburbia", "internal_links": []}, "ist": {"post_title": "Investigative Strike Teams", "tags": [], "post_content": "Investigative Strike Teams\n==========================\n\nApril 28, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ist)\n\n* * * * *\n\nJournalists get mad at bloggers: \u201cWithout real reporting, they\u2019d have\nnothing to comment on!\u201d Bloggers get mad at journalists: \u201cThere\u2019s a\nreason nobody reads newspapers anymore. They\u2019re dry and dull and wrong.\u201d\nBut the gap is shrinking: bloggers are doing more real reporting,\njournalists are getting more humanized (with all the digressions,\nopinions, and biases that entails).\n\nSo what if you paired an investigative reporter with a blogger?\nReporters didn\u2019t used to write their own stories. (Why would a good\ninvestigator be a good writer?) The reporter would be out in the field,\nknocking on doors and taking notes, which they\u2019d hand to a writer at a\ndesk, who would turn them into a coherent, vivid story. (*Newsweek*\nstill operates this way.)\n\nReplace the writer with a blogger. They\u2019d post the story as it unfolded,\ncapturing the excitement of discovery: the big breaks, the wrong turns,\nthe moment when it all comes together. Like any talented blogger, they\u2019d\nkeep people coming back: *What happens next? I want to know more!*\nThey\u2019d keep up a conversation with readers and other bloggers, sharing\nnew leads with the reporter. It\u2019d be a powerful duo.\n\nBut blogging isn\u2019t everything. You also want to recap the story so far:\nfor those just tuning in, here are the characters, here\u2019s what\u2019s\nhappened, here\u2019s why it\u2019s important. Keep a summary article alongside\nthe blog and update it in tandem. It would lay out the whole story in\none place, with links to particular posts or source documents for more\ninformation. That way everyone can always get an overview of the bigger\npicture \u2014 including the reporters.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want a tech person around to help out. Many stories involve\ndatabases; you need someone to work with the reporter to parse and\nprocess the data, then work with the blogger to put the results online.\nAnd there are plenty of other times where a small program or some tech\nknowledge comes in handy.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll need a lawyer on staff. Getting information isn\u2019t easy.\nYou\u2019ll need someone who can file FOIA lawsuits and respond to legal\nthreats. Maybe you can even file lawsuits against corporate malefactors\nand obtain documents in discovery. Then work with *pro bono* lawyers or\npublic interest law firms to win the lawsuit in its own right.\n\nLawsuits are needed because modern investigations can\u2019t stop at\npublication. If there was an era when a front page *Times* story could\nstop a scandal, that era is over. Ending abuses requires action. This\nmakes traditional journalists uncomfortable. They see their job as\nreporting the facts, not changing them.\n\nWe may always need the detached journalist interested only in The Truth,\nbut there\u2019s room for more. Just as journalism needs to become more\nhumanized, it needs to become more activist. Journalists uncover\noutrageous things, which gets people outraged, but they seem to think\nchanneling that outrage into something productive is someone else\u2019s\nresponsibility.\n\nInstead, a good investigative team needs a political organizer. They can\nbuild an email list of people who get outraged by their reporting and\nuse it, along with blogs and the lists of other political groups, to put\npressure on the bad guys, fundraise for further journalism, and collect\na team of volunteers. The volunteers can help with aspects of the\nreporting \u2014 a modern investigation can get much further by crowdsourcing\ncertain tricky aspects and depending on talented volunteers for\nparticular tasks. A good political organizer knows how to get and manage\nvolunteers.\n\nBut to make your organizing maximally effective, you\u2019ll need (gasp!) a\nlobbyist. They\u2019ll meet with representatives to encourage them to hold\nhearings based on stories you\u2019re working on, where they can subpoena\ndocuments and testimony. They\u2019ll ask representatives to introduce bills\nto address the abuses you\u2019ve uncovered and work with them on legislative\nstrategy to get those bills passed. And they\u2019ll team up with the\npolitical organizer to get constituents writing to their representatives\nin favor of these bills.\n\nThe only way to get good at something is deliberate practice: trying\nvarious things and seeing how they work. But when it comes to making\nchange, that\u2019s very hard to do. Change requires so many people and takes\nso long that it\u2019s almost impossible to say for sure that your doing X\nhelped accomplish Y. Which means that it becomes very easy to fool\nyourself into thinking you\u2019re more effective than you are.\n\nBut if you have one team \u2014 some reporters, a blogger/writer, a techie, a\nlawyer, an organizer, and a lobbyist \u2014 together, they form an\ninvestigative strike team: uncovering corruption, exposing it, and\neffecting change. They can watch the whole process unfold from a\nreporter\u2019s suspicion to a writer\u2019s story to a legislative fix. And they\ncan get better at it. It\u2019d be a powerful combination.

Keynes, the story goes, figured out\nthe causes of the Great Depression and in doing so revolutionized the\nfield of economics. Some conservative economists have forgotten or\nignored his work, but society as a whole remembers his basic discovery:\nyou get out of downturns by spending money.\n\nReading Keynes\u2019 *General Theory of Employment, Money, and Interest* then\nis a sobering experience. For the book is, indeed, truly brilliant, a\ndefinite work of genius. It\u2019s the best book on the economy I\u2019ve ever\nread; indeed, it\u2019s one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. Everyone has\nseen bits and pieces of wit quoted from the book, but Keynes weaves them\ninto a beautiful tapestry that explains the whole of the modern economy.\nAnd yet, the book is a necessary now as it was then: economics has not\nlearned a single one of his lessons.\n\nThis is a depressing thought, especially since Keynes throughout seems\noptimistic that once he\u2019s explained everything so clearly, economics\nwill be back on the right track. But politics has triumphed over logic\nand we\u2019ve forgotten all the crucial things he explained.\n\nPerhaps this is why it has a reputation for being a very tough book \u2014 so\ndifficult that even economists can\u2019t follow it. But I think this is\nentirely due to a difference in philosophies: the *General Theory* was\nthe first book on economics I could really understand. And that\u2019s\nbecause, unlike most economics books, it *makes sense* \u2014 the theories it\nproposes comport with the real world, instead of taking place in some\nfantasyland of perfect competition.\n\nStill, the book isn\u2019t exactly a smooth read. Keynes uses some archaic\nlanguage and is trying to communicate some complicated ideas. There\u2019s no\nmath, but there\u2019s still a lot to chew on. So I thought I\u2019d try my best\nat an explanation/summary. It\u2019s a long book, so if you\u2019re in a hurry,\nyou might prefer [my shorter summary of the fundamental\nideas](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/keynes).\n\n* * * * *\n\n[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and\nMoney](http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/)\n[full text]\n\nBook I: Introduction\n--------------------\n\n**1:** This chapter cheekily consists of a single paragraph. It says the\nbook is an attempt to show that classical economics (basically that\nsummarized by Alfred Marshall, including Ricardo, Mill, Edgeworth, and\nPigou) addresses only a special case of the economy, while this book\noutlines a more general theory.\n\n**2:** The classical theory of employment says the labor market is just\nanother market: people get paid what they make and people only work if\nthey get paid enough to make it worth it. Since it seemed unlikely that\nsociety had run out of money-making jobs, it was assumed that\nunemployment was caused either by people not knowing where the jobs were\n(frictional unemployment) or insisting on being paid more than they\ncould make (voluntary unemployment).\n\nIt seems difficult to explain the high unemployment of the Great\nDepression this way, but economists didn\u2019t see how it could be\notherwise. So their solution was simple: to end unemployment, people\njust needed to be willing to work for less.\n\nWhat this amounts to is Say\u2019s Law: supply creates its own demand. If\nthere are people around willing to work, jobs will spring up to make use\nof them. If people are unemployed, it must be because they\u2019re refusing\nto take the job.\n\nThere are two obvious problems with this. First, people may refuse to\nwork for a lower nominal wage when they\u2019ll accept working for a lower\nreal (i.e. inflation-adjusted) wage. That is, if management decides to\npay people \\$4 an hour instead of \\$5, people might go on strike, but\nnobody ever goes on strike demanding a raise because the cost of milk\nhas gone up. (So inflation might actually be a better solution than wage\ncuts.)\n\nSecond, if wages go down, then the cost of making things goes down,\nwhich means that prices go down, which means that in real terms wages\nend up staying about the same.\n\nKeynes has found a crack in the classical theory. The first half of this\nbook will be dedicated to prying it open. The second half is filling it\nin.\n\n**3:** When people get money, they spend some of it \u2014 but not all of it.\nAnd businesses choose whether to hire people based on how much they\nexpect to sell. But how much they sell is exactly dependent on how much\npeople spend.\n\nSo it\u2019s how much people spend that determines employment. But this is\ntotally consistent with there being unemployment \u2014 if people aren\u2019t\nbuying, businesses aren\u2019t selling, so they fire people (who then buy\nless).\n\nIndeed, this problem will be worse in richer countries, since the more\npeople make the less of it they need to spend and thus less money is\nused to hire people. (The details of how the remainder gets invested has\nto do with interest and will be addressed later.)\n\nSince this seems so basic, Keynes is puzzled at how it\u2019s been so\nignored:\n\n> The completeness of the [classical] victory is something of a\n> curiosity and a mystery. It must have been due to a complex of\n> suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was\n> projected. That it reached conclusions quite different from what the\n> ordinary uninstructed person would expect, added, I suppose, to its\n> intellectual prestige. That its teaching, translated into practice,\n> was austere and often unpalatable, lent it virtue. That it was adapted\n> to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure, gave it beauty.\n> That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an\n> inevitable incident in the scheme of progress, and the attempt to\n> change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good,\n> commended it to authority. That it afforded a measure of justification\n> to the free activities of the individual capitalist, attracted to it\n> the support of the dominant social force behind authority.\n>\n> But although the doctrine itself has remained unquestioned by orthodox\n> economists up to a late date, its signal failure for purposes of\n> scientific prediction has greatly impaired, in the course of time, the\n> prestige of its practitioners. For professional economists, after\n> Malthus, were apparently unmoved by the lack of correspondence between\n> the results of their theory and the facts of observation;\u2014a\n> discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe, with the\n> result of his growing unwillingness to accord to economists that\n> measure of respect which he gives to other groups of scientists whose\n> theoretical results are confirmed by observation when they are applied\n> to the facts.\n>\n> The celebrated optimism of traditional economic theory, which has led\n> to economists being looked upon as Candides, who, having left this\n> world for the cultivation of their gardens, teach that all is for the\n> best in the best of all possible worlds provided we will let well\n> alone, is also to be traced, I think, to their having neglected to\n> take account of the drag on prosperity which can be exercised by an\n> insufficiency of effective demand. For there would obviously be a\n> natural tendency towards the optimum employment of resources in a\n> society which was functioning after the manner of the classical\n> postulates. It may well be that the classical theory represents the\n> way in which we should like our economy to behave. But to assume that\n> it actually does so is to assume our difficulties away.\n\nBook II: Definitions and Ideas\n------------------------------\n\n**4:** The next three chapters aren\u2019t so much part of the argument as\nattempts to clear up some basic concepts and objections.\n\nWe start by observing it\u2019s impossible to measure things like \u201cnet\noutput\u201d or \u201cprice level\u201d accurately \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to compare\nqualitatively different things and run into no end of difficulties.\n\n> To say that net output to-day is greater, but the price-level lower,\n> than ten years ago or one year ago, is a proposition of a similar\n> character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but\n> not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth \u2014 a proposition not without\n> meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the\n> differential calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we\n> try to use such partly vague and non-quantitative concepts as the\n> basis of a quantitative analysis.\n\nWe can\u2019t measure net output, but we can count the number of people\nemployed. In general, if more people are working then more stuff is\ngetting made, although this obviously isn\u2019t a perfect connection. But\nemployment is kind of a more interesting number and it will have to do.\n\nSo we\u2019ll use only two types of counts: those of actual currency\n(money-values) and those of people (employment). And while workers are\nobviously not all equivalent the way dollar bills are, we can take an\nhour of unskilled labor as our standard and count people with special\nskills as multiples of an hour of unskilled labor. Thus if someone makes\ntwice as much per hour as an unskilled laborer, we\u2019ll count each hour\nthey work as two unskilled hours. We\u2019ll call these hours labor-units and\nwe\u2019ll call the money that gets paid for them wage-units. Thus the total\namount spent on wages equals the wage-unit times the number of\nlabor-units.\n\n[AS: Obviously this accounting fiction isn\u2019t particularly realistic\nsince, in reality, the multiples people get paid change as the wage-unit\ngoes up. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a lawyer who makes \\$300 an hour and minimum wage\nis \\$5 an hour. If the minimum wage is doubled to \\$10 an hour, I\u2019m not\nsuddenly going to get paid \\$600 an hour, even though my relative\nproductivity hasn\u2019t changed. Keynes seems to suggest this can be modeled\nas \u201ca rapid liability to change in the supply of labor;\u201d I guess that\u2019s\npossible.]\n\nAnd as for some people being better at some jobs than others, we just\npretend that\u2019s an artifact of the equipment they use. In other words, as\nemployment goes up and we run out of skilled truck-builders, we say the\ntruck factory is getting less efficient. (If, indeed, there\u2019s nobody\nleft who can build the trucks, we say the truck factory\u2019s efficiency has\ngone to zero.)\n\nAs problematic as this is, Keynes points out that it\u2019s a lot more\nrealistic than the classical theory, which just seems to magically\nassume everyone is paid in proportion to their productivity. By\nsubsuming more efficient people with their machinery, Keynes says he\nbetter deals with the usual case, which is that the increase in\nefficiency goes to their boss (who owns the machines). And when more\nefficient workers actually are paid more, he takes that into account as\nnoted above.\n\n**5:** Businesses make production decisions not based on sales or\nanything solidly measurable, but on personal opinions: expectations.\nThese can be either short-term expectations (the barrista will be given\nthe day off if management doesn\u2019t expect any customers) or long-term\nexpectations (Starbucks won\u2019t open up a new story if they expect coffee\nconsumption to start going down).\n\nEither way, new expectations don\u2019t always take effect immediately (if\nyou just opened a new store and then decide it wasn\u2019t worth it, you\ndon\u2019t immediately close it). And the process of adjusting can have some\nodd effects: if you need to quickly ramp up production, you might keep\nhiring until you have more employees than you really need in the\nlong-run. You use the extra people to get you up to speed, then you lay\nthem off. The result is \u201ca gradual crescendo in the level of employment,\nrising to a peak and then declining to the new long-period level.\u201d This\ncan happen even if you don\u2019t expect to sell more things, but just a\nslightly different thing: you \u201coverhire\u201d to get up to speed on the new\nmodel, but then fire people until you\u2019re back down to your previous\nlevel.\n\n> An uninterrupted process of transition, such as the above, to a new\n> long-period position can be complicated in detail. But the actual\n> course of events is more complicated still. For the state of\n> expectation is liable to constant change, a new expectation being\n> superimposed long before the previous change has fully worked itself\n> out; so that the economic machine is occupied at any given time with a\n> number of overlapping activities, the existence of which is due to\n> various past states of expectation.\n\nThat said, today\u2019s decisions are based on the conditions of today and\nexpectations about tomorrow \u2014 not on past expectations or the conditions\nof the past. And, in practice, people don\u2019t calculate their expectations\nfrom scratch each morning. They keep doing what they did yesterday\nunless they have a reason to change. Long-term expectations can\u2019t be\neasily checked, so when they do change, they often change suddenly. Thus\nthey can\u2019t even be approximately estimated.\n\n**6:** When you\u2019re producing something, there are a couple of things\ninvolved. One is the amount of capital and equipment and so on you use\nup, which we\u2019ll call the *user cost*. Another is the amount you pay to\nemployees and other companies and so on, the *factor cost*. These two\ncombined are the *prime cost*. The *entrepreneur\u2019s income* is the value\nof his output less the prime cost \u2014 that\u2019s what he tries to maximize.\n\nEntrepreneurs can also lose capital due to unavoidable events \u2014 a market\ncrash, an earthquake, the passage of time. These are *supplementary\ncosts*. In addition, there are the unavoidable and unforeseen, which\nwe\u2019ll call *windfall loss*. We\u2019ll define *net income* as just income\nminus supplementary costs, since people can\u2019t really be blamed for the\nunforeseen events.\n\nThe *total income* of the community is just the amount sold minus the\nuser cost. And *total consumption* is just all the stuff that isn\u2019t sold\nto other businesses. [AS: I\u2019ve been saying businesses because I find it\nclearer, but Keynes actually says entrepreneurs. I think I also use this\nkind of interchangeably with capitalists. Sorry.] *Saving*, of course,\nis just income minus consumption.\n\n*Investment* is just the amount of current output that isn\u2019t consumed.\nBut since saving is just the amount of income that isn\u2019t consumed and\nincome is just output (output is always output to someone), savings\nnecessarily equals investment.\n\n[AS: This seems to be a little controversial (and, indeed, tends to be a\nbit confusing), but let\u2019s just accept it as a quirky definition, not any\nkind of factual claim.]\n\n**7:** Keynes spends the chapter defending his decision to define\nsavings as equal to investment. [AS: I think he only ends up in making\nthings more confusing, but maybe I\u2019m missing something.]\n\nBook III: The Propensity to Consume\n-----------------------------------\n\n**8:** We return now to our main argument. Earlier we said people spend\nthe money they get, but not all of it. What changes how much they spend?\nNot much, Keynes argues. (Maybe large changes in interest rates, but\nthose are rare.)\n\n\u201cThe fundamental psychological law,\u201d he says, is that, on average, the\namount people spend increases as the amount they make increases, but not\nas quickly. (If you make \\$50K a year, you might spend \\$40K of it. If\nyou make \\$1M, you might spend \\$500K of it. Obviously a lot more in\nabsolute terms, but far less proportionately.) And this is especially\ntrue in the short-term \u2014 people\u2019s habits take time to catch up with\ntheir incomes.\n\nBut this means that as national income increases, a smaller proportion\nof it will get spent, so more of it will have to be invested. And when\nnational income falls, a larger proportion gets spent as people dip into\nsavings and governments go into deficit. This is fortunate, because\nlower consumption also means lower income (when people buy less,\nbusinesses make less, so they pay you less). If consumption fell at the\nsame rate as income, we\u2019d fall into a downward spiral: lower consumption\nwould mean lower income, which in turn would mean lower consumption, and\nsoon we\u2019d all be out of a job.\n\n\u201cConsumption \u2014 to repeat the obvious \u2014 is the sole end and object of all\neconomic activity.\u201d What are we making things for if not to use them?\nPeople can either be put to work making things for people to use today\nor making things for people to use tomorrow, but that tomorrow \u201ccannot\nbe pushed indefinitely into the future.\u201d After all, an hour of labor\ncannot be \u201csaved\u201d and put into a bank for a rainy day! If people are out\nof work now, the time they\u2019re wasting will never be recovered. [AS: This\nis truly brilliant. It\u2019s hard to convey the excitement I felt when\nreading this.] Saving money for the future is not the same as making\nthings for the future \u2014 it\u2019s only the latter that\u2019s useful.\n\nBut it\u2019s not easy to think of useful things to make for the future.\nEventually, we\u2019re forced to make things for today. But as our incomes\nincrease, we spend less on things today. And there\u2019s our trap: if we\ndon\u2019t make things for tomorrow and we don\u2019t make things for today,\npeople are forced out of work since there\u2019s nothing for them to make.\n\nAnother way to look at it is the more stuff we make for tomorrow, the\nless stuff we need to make tomorrow. And then what do we do? At some\npoint we just need to consume more stuff.\n\nPeople seem to recognize this when it comes to government making stuff.\n\u2018\u201cWhat will you do,\u201d it is asked, \u201cwhen you have built all the houses\nand roads and town halls and electric grids and water supplies and so\nforth which the stationary population of the future can be expected to\nrequire?\u201d\u2019 But the same logic applies to private investment. What will\nwe do when we\u2019ve built all the factories the people of the future can be\nexpected to use?\n\nMoney can\u2019t survive on its own. If we don\u2019t ever spend it, it becomes\nworthless.\n\n**9:** How does raising interest rates affect consumption? We\u2019ve said it\ndoesn\u2019t have much effect on people\u2019s *propensity* to consume, but a\nhigher interest rate means it\u2019s more expensive to borrow money, which\nmeans companies invest less, which means incomes are reduced. (Since\nsavings=investment, incomes are reduced such that the amount left over\nfor savings equals the lesser amount now invested. [AS: This is the\nfirst use of that suspicious definition.]) Most people think that as the\ninterest rate goes up, spending goes down and saving goes up, but this\nshows that saving and spending both decrease.\n\n> The more virtuous we are, the more determinedly thrifty, the more\n> obstinately orthodox in our national and personal finance, the more\n> our incomes will have to fall when interest rises relatively to the\n> marginal efficiency of capital. Obstinacy can bring only a penalty and\n> no reward. For the result is inevitable.\n>\n> Thus, after all, the actual rates of aggregate saving and spending do\n> not depend on Precaution, Foresight, Calculation, Improvement,\n> Independence, Enterprise, Pride or Avarice. Virtue and vice play no\n> part. It all depends on how far the rate of interest is favourable to\n> investment, after taking account of the marginal efficiency of\n> capital. No, this is an overstatement. If the rate of interest were so\n> governed as to maintain continuous full employment, Virtue would\n> resume her sway; \u2014 the rate of capital accumulation would depend on\n> the weakness of the propensity to consume. Thus, once again, the\n> tribute that classical economists pay to her is due to their concealed\n> assumption that the rate of interest always is so governed.\n\n**10:** We\u2019ve established that an increase in investment leads to an\nincrease in income. But how much? Even if you hire people for\ninvestment, the money those people get paid in turn gets spent on\nadditional consumption, increasing employment indirectly as well. (Of\ncourse, this is only true until we hit full employment \u2014 then prices\njust inflate.)\n\nThere must be an investment multiplier \u2014 call it *k* \u2014 such that an\nextra \\$1 invested leads to \\$*k* increase in income. And there must be\na similar employment multiplier (*k\u2019*) where for each person hired for a\njob, *k\u2019* people get hired in total.\n\nBut spending can have negative effects as well. [AS: Keynes apparently\nhas government investment \u2014 i.e. stimulus \u2014 in mind here, although he\nnever really comes out and says it.] If the interest rate goes up, that\nwill slow investment. If people lose \u201cconfidence\u201d because of all the\nspending, they may decide to hold onto their money. And some of the\nmoney can \u201cleak\u201d out to other countries. But this just weakens the\nmultiplier, it doesn\u2019t eliminate it.\n\nRecall that the classical theory said people needed to be paid enough to\ncompensate them for their distaste for working. But if you\u2019ve been\nunemployed long enough, you might actually *want* to work. If that\u2019s\ntrue, even wasting money is a good thing. \u201cPyramid-building,\nearthquakes, even wars may serve to increase wealth, if the education of\nour statesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the\nway of anything better.\u201d\n\n> It is curious how common sense, wriggling for an escape from absurd\n> conclusions, has been apt to reach a preference for wholly \u201cwasteful\u201d\n> forms of loan expenditure rather than for *partly* wasteful forms,\n> which, because they are not *wholly* wasteful, tend to be judged on\n> strict \u201cbusiness\u201d principles. For example, unemployment relief\n> financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of\n> improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst\n> the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which\n> not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but\n> involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all\n> solutions.\n\n(Recall that at this time the world was still on the gold standard and\nthus mining for gold was equivalent to printing new money.)\n\n> If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at\n> suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the\n> surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on\n> well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the\n> right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of\n> the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and,\n> with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community,\n> and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater\n> than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build\n> houses and the like; but if there are political and practical\n> difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than\n> nothing.\n>\n> The analogy between this expedient and the goldmines of the real world\n> is complete.

Thus gold-mines are of the greatest value and\n> importance to civilisation. just as wars have been the only form of\n> large-scale loan expenditure which statesmen have thought justifiable,\n> so gold-mining is the only pretext for digging holes in the ground\n> which has recommended itself to bankers as sound finance; and each of\n> these activities has played its part in progress-failing something\n> better. To mention a detail, the tendency in slumps for the price of\n> gold to rise in terms of labour and materials aids eventual recovery,\n> because it increases the depth at which gold-digging pays and lowers\n> the minimum grade of ore which is payable.\n\n(Keynes goes on to contrast gold-mining with building new houses which,\nbeing actually useful, has the side effect of decreasing the rent of old\nones.)\n\n> Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its\n> fabled wealth, in that it possessed two activities, namely,\n> pyramid-building as well as the search for the precious metals, the\n> fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being\n> consumed, did not stale with abundance.

[emphasis added]\n\nBook IV: The Inducement to Invest\n---------------------------------\n\n**11:** Imagine you get a new widget-making machine. There\u2019s the value\nof the widgets you expect [AS: there\u2019s that word again] it to produce,\nless the cost of its inputs and maintenance. Call that the *yield*. Then\nthere\u2019s the cost of creating one more new widget-making machine. Call\nthat the *supply cost*. The *marginal efficiency of capital* is the\nyield less the supply cost. [AS: Marginal efficiency of capital comes up\na lot, so we\u2019ll save time by calling it \u201cyour expected return.\u201d]\n\nOf course there\u2019s lots of different things you can invest in; we\u2019re\nassuming that you do whatever maximizes your expected return. And\nobviously you\u2019ll keep borrowing money and investing it until your\nexpected return reaches the market rate of interest.\n\nIt\u2019s through the expected yield that changes in the value of money\naffect output. If people expect inflation, then expected yields go up\nand people invest more. Deflation does the opposite.\n\n(Tyler Cowen, in his critical comments on the *General Theory* is struck\nby a throw-off clause in this chapter: Keynes says that it\u2019s unlikely\ninterest rates will go up if people expect inflation, since if people\nexpected inflation prices would have gone up already. [He\nwrites](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/04/keyness-general-theory-chapter-eleven.html):\u00a0\u201dThis\nsimple yet powerful point doesn\u2019t get the attention it ought to.\u00a0\nStorage costs for goods and services may eliminate this paradox but\nperhaps not completely.\u00a0 It is striking how few economists have thought\nthis problem through.\u201d)\n\n**12:** As we noted before, capitalists invest if they expect future\nsales to be high. But how do they know what future sales will be? \u201cIf we\nspeak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for\nestimating the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a\ntextile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a\nbuilding in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to\nnothing; or even five years hence.\u201d\n\nIn olden days, what happened was that rough-riding men of business\nthought taking risks was manly and invested their money as a way of\nlife. They got it in their head that they were going to build a\nrailroad, and by Jove they did. They didn\u2019t sit down and calculate\nwhether they could have made more money buying bonds instead. Bonds are\nfor wusses.\n\nBut now people invest their money in the stock market, which revises its\nprofitability estimates minute-by-minute. \u201cIt is as though a farmer,\nhaving tapped his barometer after breakfast, could decide to remove his\ncapital from the farming business between 10 and 11 in the morning and\nreconsider whether he should return to it later in the week.\u201d And since\nmuch new investment money is raised on the stock market, it\u2019s these\nestimates which influence new investment.\n\nAnd the stock market depends on \u201cwhat is, in truth, a *convention*\u201d \u2014\nnamely that the current valuation of a company is an accurate assessment\nof its expected yield \u2014 that stock prices will only change if there\u2019s\nnew evidence suggesting the yield will be different. Thus, even though\nwe actually have no clue what the yield might be, we all agree that the\ncurrent stock price is our best guess and instead of worrying about the\nfact we actually have no clue what the \u201cright\u201d stock price is\nwhatsoever, we only have to worry about those things which will affect\nit (the stock price).\n\nSo stock traders don\u2019t sit down and try to calculate the long-term\nexpected yield; they try to guess the short-term change in the stock\nprice and trade base on that.\n\n> This is the inevitable result of investment markets organised with a\n> view to so-called \u201cliquidity\u201d. Of the maxims of orthodox finance none,\n> surely, is more anti-social than the fetish of liquidity, the doctrine\n> that it is a positive virtue on the part of investment institutions to\n> concentrate their resources upon the holding of \u201cliquid\u201d securities.\n> It forgets that there is no such thing as liquidity of investment for\n> the community as a whole. The social object of skilled investment\n> should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which\n> envelop our future. The actual, private object of the most skilled\n> investment to-day is \u201cto beat the gun\u201d, as the Americans so well\n> express it, to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depreciating,\n> half-crown to the other fellow.\n>\n> This battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation\n> a few months hence, rather than the prospective yield of an investment\n> over a long term of years, does not even require gulls amongst the\n> public to feed the maws of the professional; \u2014 it can be played by\n> professionals amongst themselves. Nor is it necessary that anyone\n> should keep his simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation\n> having any genuine long-term validity. For it is, so to speak, a game\n> of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs \u2014 a pastime in which he is\n> victor who says *Snap* neither too soon nor too late, who passes the\n> Old Maid to his neighbour before the game is over, who secures a chair\n> for himself when the music stops. These games can be played with zest\n> and enjoyment, though all the players know that it is the Old Maid\n> which is circulating, or that when the music stops some of the players\n> will find themselves unseated.\n>\n> Or, to change the metaphor slightly, professional investment may be\n> likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have\n> to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the\n> prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly\n> corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole;\n> so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself\n> finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the\n> fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem\n> from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which,\n> to the best of one\u2019s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even\n> those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have\n> reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to\n> anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.\n> And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and\n> higher degrees.\n\nYou might think that this just means someone who actually does sit down\nand calculate expected yields could make vast profits from all the\nspeculators playing Snap. But calculating expected yields is much harder\nthan guessing what everyone else will do; there\u2019s no reason to think\nspending the same amount of time doing that is any more profitable.\n\nAnd getting money for it is much harder \u2014 people don\u2019t like it when you\ntell them \u201cYes, the stocks you bought are worthless *now* but just wait!\nNothing real has changed, you just need to hold on and see if I\u2019m right\nin the long run.\u201d People don\u2019t like it when their stocks go down. They\u2019d\nmuch rather invest their money so that its valuation keeps going up and\nup and up.\n\nAnd even if they were willing to wait, why should they trust you? \u201cFor\nit is in the essence of his behaviour that he should be eccentric,\nunconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is\nsuccessful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness;\nand if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he\nwill not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better\nfor reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\u201d\n\nThe more open our stock markets get, the more speculators predominate,\nand the worse things get for us.\n\n> When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the\n> activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done. The measure\n> of success attained by Wall Street, regarded as an institution of\n> which the proper social purpose is to direct new investment into the\n> most profitable channels in terms of future yield, cannot be claimed\n> as one of the outstanding triumphs of laissez-faire capitalism \u2014 which\n> is not surprising, if I am right in thinking that the best brains of\n> Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object.\n\nA hefty tax on each trade might be the best way to discourage\nspeculation and thus improve the functioning of the market. You might\nthink (as Keynes once did) that the best solution is to just force\npeople to hold on to what they buy, so they have to figure out what it\u2019s\nreally worth beforehand, but this will just push people to hold on to\ntheir money. The only solution would be to force everyone to either to\nbuy goods or capital assets with everything they own.\n\nAnd we return to the problem that many of our economic decisions depend\non our \u201cspontaneous optimism,\u201d our \u201canimal spirits,\u201d our \u201curge to action\nrather than inaction,\u201d not \u201cthe outcome of a weighted average of\nquantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.\u201d This\nmeans not only that slumps get exaggerated (since they depress animal\nspirits, worsening the slump) but that economic performance depends to a\nlarge degree on keeping businessmen happy. If electing FDR gets them\ndepressed, they might pull back their investments and send the economy\ninto a slump. This isn\u2019t a conspiracy, it\u2019s just the natural outcome of\na system that depends on rich people feeling good. \u201cIn estimating the\nprospects of investment, we must have regard, therefore, to the nerves\nand hysteria and even the digestions and reactions to the weather of\nthose upon whose spontaneous activity it largely depends.\u201d\n\nAs a result, it seems likely that the State, which can calculate these\nthings with an eye to the long-term and the social good, will take over\nmore and more of the job of organizing long-term investment.\n\n[[Tyler\nCowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/04/keyness-general-theory-chapter-12.html):\n\u201cThis is the best chapter in the book and one of the most important\neconomics essays of all time. \u2026 The insights here have yet to be fully\nmined.\u201d]\n\n**13:** We said before that businesses keep investing until their\nexpected return reaches the interest rate (so lower interest rates mean\nmore investment), but what determines the interest rate?\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the interest rate is the price people demand for\nsaving money instead of spending it. But this clearly isn\u2019t true \u2014\npeople can save money under their mattress and not get any interest. No,\nthe interest rate is the \u201cprice\u201d people demand for parting with their\ncash.\n\n\u201c\u2014 which implies that if the rate of interest were lower, *i.e.* if the\nreward for parting with cash were diminished, the aggregate amount of\ncash which the public would wish to hold would exceed the available\nsupply, and that if the rate of interest were raised, there would be a\nsurplus of cash which no one would be willing to hold.\u201d And if that\u2019s\ntrue then the quantity of money is the other factor that determines\ninterest rates. Thus the interest rate depends on people\u2019s desire to\nhoard cash \u2014 their liquidity preference (L) \u2014 and the quantity of money\n(M).\n\nWhy is there a liquidity preference? Why don\u2019t people just invest all\ntheir money? Interest rates never go below zero, after all. \u201cA full\nexplanation is complex and must wait for Chapter 15.\u201d But we can see one\nreason now: uncertainty about the expected [AS: there\u2019s that word again]\nrate of interest. If we expect interest rates to go up, we might want to\nhold on to our cash and use it to buy higher-yield bonds later. And\nthus, just as capital investment was driven by stock market speculation,\ninterest rates are driven by bond market speculation. Again we have a\ntradeoff between having a market (and thus volatility) or no market (and\nthus overcaution).\n\nThere are other reasons people might want to hold cash. If they expect\nto do a cash transaction in the future, they\u2019ll need to sell a bond then\n\u2014 but if the interest rate has risen in the meantime, they\u2019ll be selling\nthe bond at a loss. And if the interest rate falls, the economy will\ngrow and people will need more cash for these sorts of transactions.\n\nOK, so we have the following model: more money reduces the interest rate\n(as long as liquidity preference doesn\u2019t go up faster), lower interest\nrates increase investment (as long as expected return doesn\u2019t fall\nfaster), more investment leads to more employment (as long as the\npropensity to consume doesn\u2019t fall faster), and if employment increases\nprices will rise which can increase liquidity preference and thus\nrequire more money.\n\nThe public can\u2019t control the *amount* of hoarding, since that\u2019s\nnecessarily equal to the amount of cash. All it can do is change the\nprice of hoarding \u2014 the interest rate.\n\n**14:** \u201cCertainly the ordinary man \u2014 banker, civil servant or\npolitician \u2014 brought up on the traditional theory, and the trained\neconomist also, has carried away with him the idea that whenever an\nindividual performs an act of saving he has done something which\nautomatically brings down the rate of interest \u2026 without the necessity\nfor any special intervention or grandmotherly care on the part of the\nmonetary authority.\u201d\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen they\u2019re quite wrong. Saving doesn\u2019t lower the interest\nrate and thus increase investment \u2014 an increase in money does that.\nInstead, saving lowers demand and thus decreases employment. In which\ncase, \u201ca decreased readiness to spend will be looked on in quite a\ndifferent light.\u201d\n\n[AS: And so this is the famous paradox of thrift. While each person\nthinks they\u2019ll do better off by saving money instead of spending it, if\na whole country decides to save their money, they\u2019re all worse off,\nsince nobody will have a job.]\n\n[AS: I\u2019m taking a bit from chapter 16 since it seems to really belong\nhere:]\n\n\u201cAn act of individual saving means \u2014 so to speak \u2014 a decision not to\nhave dinner to-day.\u201d But it is not a promise to have dinner tomorrow \u2014\nit doesn\u2019t replace current demand with future demand; it decreases\ndemand altogether. And since future demand is estimated based on present\ndemand, it tends to decrease investment as well. Thus decreased\nconsumption leads to decreased employment.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to get people to realize that investing money doesn\u2019t\nactually lead to an increase in investments. The problem is that\ncapitalists aren\u2019t buying capital per se, they\u2019re buying an expected\nyield. They don\u2019t care how good the machine is at making widgets, what\nmatters is whether they can make money selling the widgets. If interest\nrates go up, it no longer becomes possible for them to make money, even\nthough the machine remains unchanged.\n\n**15:** The central bank can lower the short-term interest rate through\nopen-market operations: printing money and using it to buy short-term\ngovernment debt. But this doesn\u2019t effect the long-term rates, which\ndepend on people\u2019s expectations of what the government will do to\nshort-term rates. Perhaps the government should start buying and selling\nlong-term bonds to address this.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible (although unlikely) that no one will believe the\ngovernment can keep rates so low and so they begin hoarding all the new\ncash the government prints. \u201cIn this event the monetary authority would\nhave lost effective control over the rate of interest.\u201d [AS: This, I\npresume, is the liquidity trap.] \u201cBut whilst this limiting case might\nbecome practically important in future, I know of no example of it\nhitherto. \u2026 Moreover, if such a situation were to arise, it would mean\nthat the public authority itself could borrow through the banking system\non an unlimited scale at a nominal rate of interest.\u201d [AS: The US,\nhowever, is in this situation right now (2009).]\n\nOther traps are hyperinflation (where no one wants to hold onto money)\nand a financial crisis (where no one trusts the banks enough to let go\nof money). And there\u2019s the issue that even at low rates of interest,\nbanks still need to trust their borrowers and make enough to pay their\nexpenses, which may require them to raise rates.\n\n**16:** OK, so we\u2019re in a liquidity trap. There are all sorts of\npractical problems with lowering interest below zero, so instead what\nhappens is that, in *laissez-faire*, employment falls to reach the new\nlow levels. The only thing that can save us is if \u201cmillionaires find\ntheir satisfaction in building mighty mansions to contain their bodies\nwhen alive and pyramids to shelter them after death, or, repenting of\ntheir sins, erect cathedrals and endow monasteries or foreign missions.\u201d\nThat\u2019s no way to run a country.\n\nSo the government will print money to keep the interest rate at a level\ncorresponding to full employment. Presumably this means that interest\nrates will become very low (although you don\u2019t want them so low that\nnobody\u2019s making things to sell today). But as interest rates get lower,\nit becomes profitable to invest in building things with smaller and\nsmaller expected yields.\n\nIf this happens, then it seems likely that within a generation expected\nreturn will reach zero [AS: !!] and everything will reach its marginal\ncost.\n\nThis gets rid of the most objectionable features of capitalism \u2014 people\ncould still become rich by saving money, but there would be nothing left\nto invest it in, so their money wouldn\u2019t ever grow. It would be the end\nof the rentier \u2014 the rich person who grows richer by using his wealth to\nexploiting others.\n\n**17:** Let\u2019s step back for a second. Why is money so special? After\nall, a bond is just a promise to get some money in the future. Why\nshould it be any different from a futures contract on wheat? We could\nimagine paying the future wheat contracts in terms of wheat, resulting\nin a wheat interest rate. [AS: This sounds pretty ridiculous, I know,\nbut give it a minute.]\n\nThe big problem is that money is the one thing market processes can\u2019t\nadjust. 1) You can\u2019t just go ahead and make it \u2014 it can\u2019t be \u201cgrown like\na crop or manufactured like a motor-car.\u201d 2) You can\u2019t reclaim it from\nuse for other purposes \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have any. (Land can\u2019t be grown\neither, but if we really needed to we could free some up by moving\ncloser together. 3) It\u2019s very easy to store \u2014 it doesn\u2019t spoil. Which is\nwhy the suggestion of making it spoil (by printing money with expiration\ndates, etc.) are on the right track.\n\nOtherwise, our only relief comes from printing more money.\n\n> Thus in the absence of money and in the absence \u2014 we must, of course,\n> also suppose \u2014 of any other commodity with the assumed characteristics\n> of money, the rates of interest would only reach equilibrium when\n> there is full employment. Unemployment develops, that is to say,\n> because people want the moon; \u2014 men cannot be employed when the object\n> of desire (i.e. money) is something which cannot be produced and the\n> demand for which cannot be readily choked off.

But the truth is exactly the opposite: \u201cThat the\nworld after several millennia of steady individual saving, is so poor as\nit is in accumulated capital-assets, is to be explained, in my opinion,\nneither by the improvident propensities of mankind, nor even by the\ndestruction of war, but by the high liquidity-premiums formerly\nattaching to the ownership of land and now attaching to money.\u201d\n\n18: Keynes restates the theory.\n\nBook V: Money-wages and Prices\n------------------------------\n\n19: Now that we have the theory, we can return to the point we started\nwith: reducing nominal wages is unhelpful. The only thing that could\nwork is a one-time decrease in everyone\u2019s wages to a new level, but that\na) is never going to happen in a democracy and b) unfairly penalizes\nwage-earners over everyone else. \u201cThere are advantages in some degree of\nflexibility in the wages of particular industries so as to expedite\ntransfers from those which are relatively declining to those which are\nrelatively expanding. But the money-wage level as a whole should be\nmaintained as stable as possible, at any rate in the short period.\u201d\n\n20: We\u2019ve said that employment ultimately comes from demand. So why\nshould the government promote investment instead of demand? It\u2019s because\ninvestment comes first. If you give people money to buy more (say)\niPods, then first all the existing iPods get sold. This raises the\nprice, which makes Apple richer but doesn\u2019t help any employees \u2014 and\nApple likes to save its money much more than its employees do.\nEventually they begin to run out of iPods and start investing in\nadditional factories to make more. And then those factories hire people\nto work there, who spend their wages on other things. It works, it\u2019s\njust slow \u2014 if you want to get people employed quickly, you\u2019re better\noff starting with building the factories.\n\nOK, so you promote investment, but how much investment? Well, until you\nhave full employment obviously.\n\n**21:** Traditional economics is divided between the theory of value\n(perfect competition, supply and demand, and all that good stuff) in the\nmain spot and then over to the side has a separate theory of money\n(dealing interest rates and inflation), with no clear connection between\nthe two. \u201cWe have all of us become used to finding ourselves sometimes\non the one side of the moon and sometimes on the other, without knowing\nwhat route or journey connects them, related, apparently, after the\nfashion of our waking and our dreaming lives.\u201d The right split is\nbetween the theory of the individual industry and the theory of the\neconomy as a whole. Or perhaps between the stationary economy and the\nshifting one, for money\u2019s power \u201cflows from its being a link between the\npresent and the future.\u201d\n\nSo how does printing money affect prices? Well, the naive view is that\nit doesn\u2019t \u2014 the additional money gets used to buy more things which\nhires more people \u2014 until everyone is hired. Then the money can\u2019t go to\nhire more people so it just goes to bid up the prices of things,\ncreating inflation. As I said, that\u2019s the naive view \u2014 there are a\ncouple complications.\n\nHow does money influence demand? Primarily thru the rate of interest,\nwhich depends on liquidity preferences, marginal efficiencies, and\ninvestment multipliers. But these all depend on other complicating\nfactors.\n\nMarginal prime costs and labor costs increase as industry is forced to\nuse more expensive equipment and laborers, resulting in higher prices.\nSome industries hit \u201cbottlenecks\u201d first, causing their prices to rise\nand demand to be funneled into industries that are faster to respond.\nThen as some workers receive better wages other workers will demand it\nand, since business is booming, receive it. Finally, with the additional\ndemand equipment and so on will have to be replaced, raising marginal\ncosts.\n\nThere\u2019s an asymmetry in the system that workers will resist falling\nwages, but not rising ones. But this is good, because otherwise wages\nwould fall to zero in any downturn and the entire economy would shut\ndown. But the side effect is that \u201cthe very long-run course of prices\nhas almost always been upward.\u201d\n\nBook VI: Short Notes Suggested by the General Theory\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**22:** Why are there trade cycles, aka business cycles, aka booms and\nbusts?\n\nLet\u2019s start by thinking about the end of the boom. So business is\nbooming and everyone\u2019s optimistic \u2014 even though costs of production (and\nmaybe interest rates) are rising, sales are too, so expected profits are\nlooking good. But since no one really knows what they\u2019re doing,\nespecially not the speculators, it\u2019s understandable that \u201cwhen\ndisillusion falls upon an over-optimistic and over-bought market, it\nshould fall with sudden and even catastrophic force.\u201d Everyone gets\nfreaked out that they\u2019re not going to make money anymore and stops\ninvesting and raises their liquidity preference, raising interest rates\nand lowering investment further.\n\nBecause these things go together, they\u2019re sometimes mistaken as the\ncause, but note that it\u2019s the expected return which falls first, then\ninterest rates rise. So even lowering interest rates isn\u2019t enough to\nrecover from the crash. And \u201cit is not so easy to revive the marginal\nefficiency of capital, determined, as it is, by the uncontrollable and\ndisobedient psychology of the business world. It is the return of\nconfidence, to speak in ordinary language, which is so insusceptible to\ncontrol in an economy of individualistic capitalism. This is the aspect\nof the slump which bankers and business men have been right in\nemphasising, and which the economists who have put their faith in a\n\u2018purely monetary\u2019 remedy have underestimated.\u201d\n\nAnd there are other problems: when the stock market crashes, rich people\nsee themselves as less rich and decide to start spending less. (And when\neveryone follows the stock market, like in the US, this applies to\neveryone.) And the fact that people aren\u2019t spending further decreases\nexpected returns.\n\nSo that\u2019s the bust. What about recovery? Well, recovery can\u2019t come until\nold equipment is used up and has to be replaced and old stocks of goods\nthat were produced get sold off and have to be replenished. When\nrecovery picks up, it feeds on itself in the opposite way. But you can\u2019t\njump-start it just by lowering interest rates, since the real problem is\nexpected return. Thus the government must step in.\n\nReading this, you might think the solution is to raise interest rates to\nprevent overinvestment during booms, since lowering them doesn\u2019t get you\nout of slumps. But there\u2019s two kinds of overinvestment: disappointing\ninvestments, where the investment would have made sense except the\neconomy collapsed, and genuine overinvestment, where the investment\ncould never have made money. It\u2019s only the second kind that\u2019s an actual\nwaste of resources, and the solution to it isn\u2019t raising interest rates\n\u201cwhich would probably deter some useful investments and might further\ndiminish the propensity to consume, but in taking drastic steps, by\nredistributing incomes or otherwise, to stimulate the propensity to\nconsume.\u201d\n\nWhy does redistributing income work? Think about the dot-com bubble\nwhere everyone was blowing money on useless fiber-optic cable. If\nventure capitalists are spending all their money on useless cable, the\nsolution is to take their money away. Instead, you can give it to poor\npeople, who will use it to buy useful things like food and clothing.\n\nWhat happens isn\u2019t so much excessive investment as misdirected\ninvestment. Everyone builds houses thinking they\u2019ll all sell for lots\nand lots, then they find they aren\u2019t actually selling for so much and\nthe economy collapses. \u201cWe reach a condition where there is a shortage\nof houses, but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the\nhouses that there are.\u201d\n\n> Thus the remedy for the boom is not a higher rate of interest but a\n> lower rate of interest! For that may enable the so-called boom to\n> last. The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in\n> abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but\n> in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.\n> [\u2026]\n>\n> Except during the war, I doubt if we have any recent experience of a\n> boom so strong that it led to full employment. \u2026 Nor was there\n> over-investment in the sense that the standard and equipment of\n> housing was so high that everyone, assuming full employment, had all\n> he wanted at a rate which would no more than cover the replacement\n> cost, without any allowance for interest, over the life of the house;\n> and that transport, public services and agricultural improvement had\n> been carried to a point where further additions could not reasonably\n> be expected to yield even their replacement cost. Quite the contrary.\n> It would be absurd to assert of the United States in 1929 the\n> existence of over-investment in the strict sense.\n\nIn short, increasing interest rates to kill booms \u201cbelongs to the\nspecies of remedy which cures the disease by killing the patient.\u201d\n\nWhat would the world of the permanent boom look like? It\u2019s conceivable\nthat it might lead not just to full employment, but *full investment* \u2014\na world with so much plenty that you couldn\u2019t expect to make a profit on\nany kind of durable good. \u201cMoreover, this situation might be reached\ncomparatively soon\u2014say within twenty-five years or less. I must not be\ntaken to deny this, because I assert that a state of full investment in\nthe strict sense has never yet occurred, not even momentarily.\u201d\n\nOthers say the problem is that the country is so unequal that poor\npeople can\u2019t spend enough. The solution, they propose, is redistributing\nmoney to the poor to promote jobs. They are \u201cundoubtedly in the right\n[at present],\u201d when investment is \u201cunplanned and uncontrolled.\u201d There\u2019s\nno other way to raise employment. If you can\u2019t increase investment, you\nhave to increase consumption.\n\nBut we *could* increase investment: \u201cthe wisest course is to advance on\nboth fronts at once.\u201d Not just so that the people we give money to can\nbuy the new products investment creates, but so that they have enough\nmoney to buy even more, and thus spark growth themselves!\n\n**23:** Now that Keynes has outlined his revolutionary theory, it\u2019s time\nto look back at other economists the classical school dismissed.\n\nThe classical school \u2014 including Keynes in earlier years \u2014 grew up\nmocking mercantilism (protectionism) as incoherent and absurd. But maybe\nit makes some sense: Growth depends on the inducements to new\ninvestment. Investment is either foreign or domestic. Domestic\ninvestment is encouraged by the interest rate and foreign investment by\nthe balance of trade. Thus, if you ignore direct investment by the\ngovernment (as people had), these are the two things to be concerned\nabout.\n\nNow in general the interest rate is governed by the quantity of money\nand \u201cin an age in which substantial foreign loans and the outright\nownership of wealth located abroad are scarcely practicable\u201d (not to\nmention the international gold standard), money equals precious metals\nwhich equals the balance of trade. (Since running a trade deficit with a\ncountry means sending them your precious metals instead of your\nexports.) Thus focusing on the balance of trade serves both purposes \u2014\nand, at a time we didn\u2019t know how to control interest rates, was the\nonly direct means of controlling them.\n\nNot all protectionism promotes the balance of trade, of course \u2014\nmid-1800s Britain probably would have done best with complete free\ntrade. But mercantilists saw the key points sooner than most, calling\nfor an increase in money to reduce the interest rate.\n\nBut the worst part of the international gold system is the way it sets\ncountries against one another. For a country could only keep its\ncitizens employed if it had gold, and the only way to get gold was by\ntaking it from another country (and thus throwing them out of work).\n\u201cNever in history was there a method devised of such efficacy for\nsetting each country\u2019s advantage at variance with its neighbours\u2019!\u201d\n\n> The mercantilists perceived the existence of the problem without being\n> able to push their analysis to the point of solving it. But the\n> classical school ignored the problem, as a consequence of introducing\n> into their premisses conditions which involved its non-existence; with\n> the result of creating a cleavage between the conclusions of economic\n> theory and those of common sense. The extraordinary achievement of the\n> classical theory was to overcome the beliefs of the \u2018natural man\u2019 and,\n> at the same time, to be wrong.\n\nAnother thing the classical economists long mocked were laws against\nusury. \u201cI was brought up to believe that the attitude of the Medieval\nChurch to the rate of interest was inherently absurd, and that the\nsubtle discussions aimed at distinguishing the return on money-loans\nfrom the return to active investment were merely Jesuitical attempts to\nfind a practical escape from a foolish theory. But I now read these\ndiscussions as an honest intellectual effort to keep separate what the\nclassical theory has inextricably confused together, namely, the rate of\ninterest and the marginal efficiency of capital. For it now seems clear\nthat the disquisitions of the schoolmen were directed towards the\nelucidation of a formula which should allow the schedule of the marginal\nefficiency of capital to be high, whilst using rule and custom and the\nmoral law to keep down the rate of interest.\u201d After all, \u201cindividual\nsavings may be absorbed either by investment or by debts, and that there\nis no security that they will find an outlet in the former.\u201d Laws\nagainst usury help ensure they do.\n\n> It is convenient to mention at this point the strange, unduly\n> neglected prophet Silvio Gesell (1862-1930), whose work contains\n> flashes of deep insight and who only just failed to reach down to the\n> essence of the matter. In the post-war years his devotees bombarded me\n> with copies of his works; yet, owing to certain palpable defects in\n> the argument, I entirely failed to discover their merit. As is often\n> the case with imperfectly analysed intuitions, their significance only\n> became apparent after I had reached my own conclusions in my own way.\n> Meanwhile, like other academic economists, I treated his profoundly\n> original strivings as being no better than those of a crank. Since few\n> of the readers of this book are likely to be well acquainted with the\n> significance of Gesell, I will give to him what would be otherwise a\n> disproportionate space.\n\nAmong Gesell\u2019s proposals are the notion of stamped money (money you have\nto pay to get stamped regularly to keep it valid currency) which is a\nway of discouraging people from hoarding. \u201cThe idea behind stamped money\nis sound. \u2026 But there are many difficulties which Gesell did not face.\nIn particular, he was unaware that money was not unique\u201d \u2014 if people\ndidn\u2019t hoard it, there\u2019s lots of other things they could hoard.\n\nKeynes also discusses Bernard Mandeville\u2019s incredible book, *The Fable\nof the Bees*. This incredible work of economic thought described the\ndivision of labor and the invisible hand in 1705, a full seventy years\nbefore Adam Smith. And, Keynes points out, it\u2019s largely about the\nparadox of thrift \u2014 centuries before Keynes! It\u2019s basically been written\nout of economic history, in part, no doubt, because it was written in\nthe form of a scandalous satirical epic poem. Indeed, it so scandalized\nits readers at the time that it was \u201cconvicted as a nuisance by the\ngrand jury of Middlesex in 1723, which stands out in the history of the\nmoral sciences for its scandalous reputation.\u201d\n\nFinally we come to Major Douglas, who led the unorthodox Social Credit\nmovement in the UK:\n\n> Major Douglas is entitled to claim, as against some of his orthodox\n> adversaries, that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the\n> outstanding problem of our economic system. Yet he has scarcely\n> established an equal claim to rank \u2014 a private, perhaps, but not a\n> major in the brave army of heretics \u2014 with Mandeville, Malthus, Gesell\n> and Hobson, who, following their intuitions, have preferred to see the\n> truth obscurely and imperfectly rather than to maintain error, reached\n> indeed with clearness and consistency and by easy logic, but on\n> hypotheses inappropriate to the facts.\n\n**24:** The two great economic problems are unemployment and inequality.\nWe have addressed the first, but what are its implications of the\nsecond? Inequality has been addressed somewhat by government\nredistribution, but some are hesitant to go further because they believe\nthat growth is promoted by savings and so taking away the savings of the\nrich will retard growth. We have seen that it\u2019s quite the opposite \u2014\nthat redistribution, by increasing effective demand, *promotes* growth.\n\u201cOne of the chief social justifications of great inequality of wealth\nis, therefore, removed.\u201d\n\nThat said, one wouldn\u2019t want to get rid of money altogether:\n\n> [D]angerous human proclivities can be canalised into comparatively\n> harmless channels by the existence of opportunities for money-making\n> and private wealth, which, if they cannot be satisfied in this way,\n> may find their outlet in cruelty, the reckless pursuit of personal\n> power and authority, and other forms of self-aggrandisement. It is\n> better that a man should tyrannise over his bank balance than over his\n> fellow-citizens; and whilst the former is sometimes denounced as being\n> but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an alternative.\n\nLet us imagine these policies are implemented. The government lowers\ninterest rates so that there\u2019s full employment. Expected return would\nthen probably fall steadily keep it there, unless there\u2019s an increase in\nthe propensity to consume (including by the State).\n\nAt this point, expected return might be just enough to cover the costs\nof production, plus a little for risk and skill \u2014 just like other goods.\n\n> Now, though this state of affairs would be quite compatible with some\n> measure of individualism, yet it would mean the euthanasia of the\n> rentier, and, consequently, the euthanasia of the cumulative\n> oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity-value of\n> capital. Interest today rewards no genuine sacrifice, any more than\n> does the rent of land. The owner of capital can obtain interest\n> because capital is scarce, just as the owner of land can obtain rent\n> because land is scarce. But whilst there may be intrinsic reasons for\n> the scarcity of land, there are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity\n> of capital. An intrinsic reason for such scarcity, in the sense of a\n> genuine sacrifice which could only be called forth by the offer of a\n> reward in the shape of interest, would not exist, in the long run,\n> except in the event of the individual propensity to consume proving to\n> be of such a character that net saving in conditions of full\n> employment comes to an end before capital has become sufficiently\n> abundant. But even so, it will still be possible for communal saving\n> through the agency of the State to be maintained at a level which will\n> allow the growth of capital up to the point where it ceases to be\n> scarce.\n>\n> I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional\n> phase which will disappear when it has done its work. And with the\n> disappearance of its rentier aspect much else in it besides will\n> suffer a sea-change. It will be, moreover, a great advantage of the\n> order of events which I am advocating, that the euthanasia of the\n> rentier, of the functionless investor, will be nothing sudden, merely\n> a gradual but prolonged continuance of what we have seen recently in\n> Great Britain, and will need no revolution.\n>\n> Thus we might aim in practice (there being nothing in this which is\n> unattainable) at an increase in the volume of capital until it ceases\n> to be scarce, so that the functionless investor will no longer receive\n> a bonus; and at a scheme of direct taxation which allows the\n> intelligence and determination and executive skill of the financier,\n> the entrepreneur *et hoc genus omen* (who are certainly so fond of\n> their craft that their labour could be obtained much cheaper than at\n> present), to be harnessed to the service of the community on\n> reasonable terms of reward.\n>\n> At the same time we must recognise that only experience can show how\n> far the common will, embodied in the policy of the State, ought to be\n> directed to increasing and supplementing the inducement to invest; and\n> how far it is safe to stimulate the average propensity to consume,\n> without foregoing our aim of depriving capital of its scarcity-value\n> within one or two generations. It may turn out that the propensity to\n> consume will be so easily strengthened by the effects of a falling\n> rate of interest, that full employment can be reached with a rate of\n> accumulation little greater than at present. In this event a scheme\n> for the higher taxation of large incomes and inheritances might be\n> open to the objection that it would lead to full employment with a\n> rate of accumulation which was reduced considerably below the current\n> level. I must not be supposed to deny the possibility, or even the\n> probability, of this outcome. For in such matters it is rash to\n> predict how the average man will react to a changed environment. If,\n> however, it should prove easy to secure an approximation to full\n> employment with a rate of accumulation not much greater than at\n> present, an outstanding problem will at least have been solved. And it\n> would remain for separate decision on what scale and by what means it\n> is right and reasonable to call on the living generation to restrict\n> their consumption, so as to establish in course of time, a state of\n> full investment for their successors.\n\nNow the State will still have to guide things; it seems unlikely that\njust controlling interest rates will be enough to ensure this utopian\nstate of affairs. Instead, it might turn out \u201ca somewhat comprehensive\nsocialisation of investment will prove the only means of securing an\napproximation to full employment; though this need not exclude all\nmanner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will\nco-operate with private initiative.\u201d Still, this is a comparatively\nconservative claim:\n\n> But beyond this no obvious case is made out for a system of State\n> Socialism which would embrace most of the economic life of the\n> community. It is not the ownership of the instruments of production\n> which it is important for the State to assume. If the State is able to\n> determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the\n> instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them, it\n> will have accomplished all that is necessary. Moreover, the necessary\n> measures of socialisation can be introduced gradually and without a\n> break in the general traditions of society. [\u2026]\n>\n> Whilst, therefore, the enlargement of the functions of government,\n> involved in the task of adjusting to one another the propensity to\n> consume and the inducement to invest, would seem to a\n> nineteenth-century publicist or to a contemporary American financier\n> to be a terrific encroachment on individualism, I defend it, on the\n> contrary, both as the only practicable means of avoiding the\n> destruction of existing economic forms in their entirety and as the\n> condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.\n>\n> For if effective demand is deficient, not only is the public scandal\n> of wasted resources intolerable, but the individual enterpriser who\n> seeks to bring these resources into action is operating with the odds\n> loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished\n> with many zeros, so that the players as a whole will lose if they have\n> the energy and hope to deal all the cards.

But if effective demand is\n> adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough.\n\nAnd, if our theory does work and we end up with full employment, then we\nreturn to the world of the classical economic theory, whose only flaw\nwas assuming that full employment was the only possible state of\naffairs. \u201cIt is in determining the volume, not the direction, of actual\nemployment that the existing system has broken down.\u201d\n\n> Is the fulfilment of these ideas a visionary hope?

Don\u2019t you wish there was some way to store stuff so\nthat it will be available forever, so that your websites could live on\neven after you die? But it\u2019s a tricky problem. There are a number of\nthings you have to worry about:\n\n-   Hardware failure. The disk you had your data on died and you can\u2019t\n    get data off it anymore. Or, even worse, your data has been silently\n    corrupted.\n\n-   Hardware skew. Your disks are still good, but they\u2019re ancient and\n    obscure and no one has drivers for them anymore. (I have some old\n    IBM tapes that I can\u2019t read because the devices are so obscure.)\n\n-   Filesystem skew. You can read the raw devices but the data was\n    stored on it using a striping technology no modern operating systems\n    implement, with a filesystem which stopped being supported after its\n    lead developer was arrested for murder, and then encoded with a\n    higher-level file distribution system that used erasure coding to\n    spread data across multiple machines.\n\n-   Format skew. Your documents may be stored in an obscure format that\n    nobody has a reader for anymore.\n\n-   Institutional failure. The people in charge of making sure all the\n    other problems get addressed die or move on.\n\nThere\u2019s a basic outline to the skew problems: use the simplest, most\npopular choice possible and then move to a replacement as it shows signs\nof going permanently extinct. It seems unlikely to me that ASCII text on\na Unix file system in a JBOD configuration will ever completely die off,\nbut if it does you\u2019ll be safe for a long time before you\u2019ll have to move\nthings over.\n\nSimilarly, for the failure problems you want: a) to choose reliable\nmaterial, b) to implement constant sanity checks, and c) have several\nlayers of backups if the sanity checks don\u2019t get executed or fail.\n\nOK, so let\u2019s get to a specific outline. You have a bunch of standard\nfiles (mostly ASCII derivatives, maybe PDFs) in a standard file system\n(UFS?) mounted read-only (with hardware-level write-prevention) from a\nbunch of standard SATA disks (no RAID or anything like that) on some\nmachines running a modern Unix. You can serve these files up using\nbog-standard HTTP (or any other file transfer protocol that can be\nmapped to the model of a Unix file system). The file names (less a\nprefix for mounting the drive) are designed to be globally unique. The\nbest way to do this is probably to combine a date and a DNS name (ala\n`tag:`). So you could imagine this file to be at:\n\n    /hdd7/2002/www.aaronsw.com/weblog/preservation.html\n\nAlongside the files, for each drive you have a manifest that lists the\ndate the file was added to the preservation system followed by the\nglobally-unique filename and two hashes: a fast hash (probably CRC32)\nand a standard secure hash (probably SHA1). As a background process, you\n(nightly? weekly?\u2014depends on how long it takes, I guess) go through each\nfile and compare its fast hash against the one listed in the manifest.\nIf the comparison fails, you go offline and sound the alarm.\n\nGoing offline isn\u2019t so bad, because you have at least two other replicas\nin different geographic locations under different political regimes. Any\nrequest traffic can go to them instead while you restore your system.\n\nFor safety, you should probably toss the whole drive and get it restored\nfrom one of the replica sites.\n\nThe manifest from each system at each site is replicated on a series of\nindex servers (at least one at each site). The index servers run a\nsimple HTTP redirector that maps from the secure hash or the globally\nunique filename to a box storing the file, using a table they generate\nfrom the manifests.\n\nIf bandwidth isn\u2019t an issue, the index server should proxy the data\ninstead of redirecting you to preserve URLs. If it is an issue, you\nshould probably try to reset the DNS name to any server which has failed\nto point to another redirector. So you can imagine the stable URL being:\n\n    http://preservation.example.org/2002/www.aaronsw.com/weblog/preservation.html\n\nand that redirecting to:\n\n    http://27.preservation.example.org/hdd7/2002/www.aaronsw.com/weblog/preservation.html\n\nwhich serves the file. When 27 fails (i.e. is no longer serving all the\ndata it was previously serving), it\u2019s given a new number and the DNS `A`\nrecord for 27.web.resource.org is changed to point to the index servers.\nThe index servers strip off any hdd prefix (such prefixes are prohibited\nat the root of the global namespace) and serve the request as they do a\nrequest for the stable URL.\n\nThe index servers also have a manifest of the manifests (with similar\nregular verification procedures). Each data server regularly publishes a\nfile with the date and the secure hash of the manifest that its regular\ncheck was compared against. The index servers regularly request this\nfile from each of the data servers and take offline any servers whose\nmanifest hash doesn\u2019t match the one in their manifest of manifests.\n\nFinally, a master manifest is generated by combining all of the\nmanifests, sorting by date, and removing duplicates. (If in this process\nyou find two different hashes for the same file, go offline and sound\nthe alarm.) At the end of every day during which files were added to the\ncollection, the system verifies that the secure hash of all the files up\nthrough yesterday is the same as it was yesterday and then makes sure\nthe index servers all agree on the new hash. If there is consensus, the\nhash of this new master manifest is calculated and very widely published\n(perhaps including a classified ad in the largest newspaper in each\ncountry). You should always be able to work backward from this\nwidely-published hash to a correct state of the entire system. And since\nall of the manifests are public, anyone with a recent newspaper and some\ntime on their hands should be able to verify the accuracy of their data.\n\nNow this protects against accidental day-to-day hardware failure, but\nyou also want to protect against long-tail catastrophic failures. You\nshould use hetrogenous systems to avoid simultaneous hardware failure or\nsoftware vulnerability, there should be no one with physical or\nelectronic access to all the systems, as much as possible you should not\nbe able to delete data without physical access, and the locations should\nbe physically secure. Does it make sense to make an alternate copy (i.e.\npaper with bytes written in OCR-A or something?) in case of an EMP blast\nor something like that? Thinking about how to protect against these\nobscure failures seems like the trickiest part.\n\nThis system should be fairly simple to implement and operate (I can\u2019t\nimagine it being more than a couple pages of Python code) but even so\nyou need someone to implement and operate it.\n\nRecall that we have at least three sites in three political\njurisdictions. Each site should be operated by an independent\norganization in that political jurisdiction. Each board should be\ngoverned by respected community members with an interest in\npreservation. Each board should have at least five seats and move\nquickly to fill any vacancies. An engineer would supervise the systems,\nan executive director would supervise the engineer, the board would\nsupervise the executive director, and the public would supervise the\nboard.\n\nThere are some basic fixed costs for operating such a system. One should\ncalculate the high-end estimate for such costs along with high-end\nestimates of their growth rate and low-end estimates of the riskless\ninterest rate and set up an endowment in that amount. The endowment\nwould be distributed evenly to each board who would invest it in\nriskless securities (probably in banks whose deposits are ensured by\ntheir political systems).\n\nWhenever someone wants to add something to the collection, you use the\nsame procedure to figure out what to charge them, calculating the\nhigh-end cost of maintaining that much more data, and add that fee to\nthe endowments (split evenly as before).\n\nWhat would the rough cost of such a system be? Perhaps the board and\nother basic administrative functions would cost \\$100,000 a year, and\nthe same for an executive director and an engineer. That would be\n\\$300,000 a year. Assuming a riskless real interest rate of 1%, a\nperpetuity for that amount would cost \\$30 million. Thus the cost for\nthree such institutions would be around \\$100 million. Expensive, but\nnot unmanageable. (For comparison, the Internet Archive has an annual\nbudget of \\$10-15M, so this whole project could be funded until the end\nof time for about what 6-10 years of the Archive costs.)\n\nStorage costs are trickier because the cost of storage and so on falls\nso rapidly, but a very conservative estimate would be around \\$2000 a\ngigabyte. Again, expensive but not unmanageable. For the price of a\nlaptop, you could have a gigabyte of data preserved for perpetuity.\n\nThese are both very high-end estimates. I imagine that were someone to\ntry operating such a system it would quickly become apparent that it\ncould be done for much less. Indeed, I suspect a Mad Archivist could set\nup such a system using only hobbyist levels of money. You can recruit\nboard members in your free time, setting up the paperwork would be a\nlittle annoying but not too expensive, and to get started you\u2019d just\nneed three servers. (I\u2019ll volunteer to write the Python code.) You could\nthen build up the endowment through the interest money left over after\nyour lower-than-expected annual costs. (If annual interest payments ever\ngot truly excessive, the money could go to reducing the accession costs\nfor new material.)\n\nAny Mad Archivists around?\n\n[Thanks to Brewster Kahle and the Internet Archive for inspiring many of\nthe technical details of this scheme.]\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1287385200.0, "postid": "preservation", "internal_links": []}, "millionairesball": {"post_title": "The Millionaire\u2019s Ball", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Millionaire\u2019s Ball\n======================\n\nNovember 9, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/millionairesball)\n\n* * * * *\n\nShe stood out, you had to admit that.

She was standing by the wall, fiddling with her drink,\nlooking cautiously out at the surroundings. \u201cHello?\u201d she said\ntentatively, unsure if the tall handsome man was really speaking to her.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said in a deep gentlemanly voice and bowed. There was an\nawkward moment or two as he stood kneeling at her feet. She wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat she was supposed to do here. Then she kneeled down as well and\nlooked at him conspiratorially. \u201cMaybe we should get out of this place,\u201d\nshe whispered, grinning.\n\nThey both stood back up and glided to the door. He helped her into the\ncar and had the driver take them back to his place, one of those\nbuildings for the wealthy in the center of Manhattan. \u201cHello Jeeves,\u201d he\nsaid to the butler at the door, before they begun dashing up the stairs.\n\u201cIs his name really Jeeves?\u201d she asked him. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he assured her.\n\u201cWe made him change it.\u201d\n\nThey quickly reached his room, a stark and modern affair that\nnonetheless managed to signal extreme wealth. They fell into designer\nchairs and he removed his coat. \u201cWould you like a cigarette?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she replied. He removed a green piece of paper from a box on\nthe shelf and rolled it with tobacco. He handed one to her and offered\nher a light before taking one himself. It smelled funny and as she\nremoved it from her mouth she saw why \u2014 it was a crisp one hundred\ndollar bill.\n\nHe saw her eyes go wide as she looked at it and laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t burn\nmoney where you come from?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have to admit,\u201d she said, \u201cthe\nidea had never occurred to me.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s quite enjoyable,\u201d he said,\nremoving the entire stack of hundred dollar bills and lighting it on\nfire.\n\nShe stared at the flame, unsure of what to do. On the one hand, she was\naghast at the wastefulness of the thing. But at the same time it was\nsomehow incredibly alluring. Lighting money on fire \u2014 it was like\npornography for the rich. Her eyes went wide and he leaned in close for\na kiss, the flames still dancing behind his head.\n\n\u201cWhat else do you do?\u201d she asked, entranced. \u201cWell, we could flush some\ndown the toilet, I suppose,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got something even\nbetter.\u201d \u201cJeeves, ready the car,\u201d he said into the intercom on the wall,\nbefore dashing down the stairs again.\n\nThe car dropped them off along the water. She wasn\u2019t quite sure where;\nher sense of the city wasn\u2019t particularly good. They strode, arm-in-arm,\nbreathing in the elegance of the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said,\n\u201cbut I don\u2019t se\u2014\u201d. \u201cJust wait,\u201d he assured her. They saw a cop up ahead,\nstrolling towards them, and in plain view he walked over to a building\nand ripped a small statue straight off and presented it to her as a\ngift.\n\nThe officer\u2019s face hardened. \u201cSir!\u201d he insisted. \u201cOh, officer!\u201d he said,\nas if he hadn\u2019t noticed him before. \u201cHow good to see you.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be\nstealing things right off of buildings,\u201d the officer said gruffly. \u201cOh,\nyou know I can,\u201d he replied. \u201cI can do much more than that.\u201d The officer\nlooked increasingly angry. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ten thousand dollars,\u201d he\nsaid, pulling out his checkbook, \u201cif you take off all your clothes.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s eyes darted back and forth, unsure of what to do. But when\nhe saw the check, he begun complying. He really could use the money. She\nlaughed and he whispered in her ear. She smiled and begun looking\nthrough her bag. \u201cSmile!\u201d she cried when he was done and snapped a\npicture. He saw the officer\u2019s eyes go wide and seized the moment to grab\nhis clothes and toss them into the water. They both begun laughing. The\nofficer tried to avoid crying. \u201cWhat about my check?\u201d the officer\npleaded. He begun to hand it to him, before snatching it back and\ntearing it in two. He tossed it into the air and then they pivoted and\nwalked away laughing.\n\nThey headed back into the car to one last stop for the night, pulling up\noutside some nightclub she\u2019d never heard of. Attractive young men and\nwomen about their age were dancing to some heavy electronic-sounding\nbeat. He got up on a table. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cexcuse me! I have\nhere a check for one hundred thousand dollars. Come over here for a\nchance to win it.\u201d They all stopped dancing and came over. Now he had\nthem in his paw. He made them jump for the check, then he made them get\ndown on their knees and bark for it like dogs. And they complied \u2014 a\nhundred twenty-somethings in trendy clothing, all down on their knees\nbarking. She\u2019d never seen anything so funny in her life.\n\nHe did a few more rounds of this before finally tossing the check into\nthe middle of the pile. Everyone lunged for it as he climbed down from\nthe table and made his getaway. \u201cWas it a real check?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh\nyes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut by the time anyone gets it it\u2019ll be torn to shreds.\u201d\n\nBack at the apartment he lifted her off he feet and tossed her onto the\nbed. He climbed on top and begun untwisting her layers of clothing, both\ngoing at each other ferociously.\n\nShe woke up the next morning, lying next to him in bed. He was smiling,\ngazing at her face. She was racked with guilt. \u201cLook,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to tell you. I\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d He\ngazed into her eyes, slightly puzzled, and she was about to explain when\nthey heard some scratching at the door.\n\nHe jumped up, just in time to be standing nude as the police burst in\nwith bulletproof vests and guns. \u201cMr. Januski,\u201d one shouted, \u201cyou\u2019re\nunder arrest for the creation of counterfeit US tender and check fraud.\u201d\nThey cuffed his hands behind his back and begun dragging him away.\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re not even going to let me get my clothes on?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said an officer, who he soon recognized to be the one from last\nnight. \u201cNow let\u2019s go.\u201d They dragged him out the door as she sat there in\nshock.\n\nFinally, she got up and put her clothes back on and then set about going\ncarefully through the room, tossing everything of value into her purse.\nWhen she\u2019d done a thorough job, she locked the door behind her dashed\ndown the stairs. \u201cGoodbye, Jeeves,\u201d she said, as she exited the\nbuilding.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1163059200.0, "postid": "millionairesball", "internal_links": []}, "deforganizing": {"post_title": "Management, Organizing, Mobilizing", "tags": [], "post_content": "Management, Organizing, Mobilizing\n==================================\n\nJune 29, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/deforganizing)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Management* is art of getting people who work for you to accomplish\nthings. It\u2019s a subtle and fascinating art, the applied version of my\ngreat intellectual love, sociology. It\u2019s usually practiced badly, but\neven when done badly it can accomplish incredible things. One person can\nonly do so much on their own\u2014their time, their powers, their creativity\nare all limited. But even an incompetent manager, who uses only a\nfraction of the powers of her employees, is capable of accomplishing\ntasks far beyond the range of any single person.\n\n*Organizing* is the art of getting people who don\u2019t work for you to\naccomplish things. Many of the underlying concepts are the same but the\nexecution is vastly more difficult. You don\u2019t really get to pick your\npeople. The people you get don\u2019t simply follow instructions, they must\nbe persuaded and cajoled and made to understand your vision. But when it\nworks, they accomplish great things you never would have allowed them to\ntry.\n\nOrganizing has many forms. The obvious one is where you take a batch of\nvolunteers and try to shape them into a manageable force. The best are\nselected, developed, promoted, and taught to do the same. It is like\ntraditional management in reverse: instead of starting with the top of a\nhierarchy and building down through hiring, you start with a bunch of\npeople at the bottom and try to build them up through training and\npromotion.\n\nBut organizing also means finding other leaders, people embedded in\nmanagement structures (organizations) of their own, and using them\ntoward a common goal. Sometimes this means explicit direction of their\nefforts, as in a coalition, where you get the heads of various groups to\nall work on a common project, or sometimes it\u2019s simply having them lend\ntheir name or knowledge to the cause. A great organizer of this sort\ndevelops rich networks they can quickly call upon in need. (Journalists\ncan be good organizers in this sense, developing connections with\nsources and experts they can leverage to create a story.)\n\nOrganizing is most prevalent in my own field of politics, where the work\nI tend to do is often called \u201conline organizing.\u201d This term usually\nmeans the kind of stuff you see on the MoveOn mailing list: emails\nasking you to call your senator, host a house party, attend a vigil \u2014\nbut mostly tell your friends and give us money. Since I got into this\nbusiness, cranky old-timers have been yelling at me that organizing\npeople over the Internet is impossible, that you have to organize people\nface-to-face. This struck me as a ridiculous claim (and still does), but\nI think I now see the truth these critics are reacting to.\n\nOnline organizing is a huge misnomer. Sending emails to millions isn\u2019t\norganizing, any more than writing company wide memos is managing. It\ndoes not teach people new skills or persuade them of a larger vision or\nget them to continue the work themselves. It takes people where they are\nand gives them small things they can do from there.\n\nMobilizing can be done thru any medium. The folks who knock on your door\nto ask for your vote (or donation) are face-to-face mobilizers. You can\ndo the same by telephone or television (call now to contribute!). It is,\nhowever, a one-way relationship. You are simply a number on a list.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean online organizing is impossible, just that it\nisn\u2019t often done. Obviously it\u2019s much harder than mere mobilization\u2014and\nmuch more complicated\u2014but it\u2019s much more rewarding as well. It is what\nmakes for a successful open source project, or a thriving online\ncommunity. The problem is one of scale \u2014 and that\u2019s true when it\u2019s done\nthrough any medium. IAF and ACORN never had five million members. Still,\nthis seems to be the genuinely important question: whether the scaling\npower of the Internet allows for a revolution in the scale of real\norganizing. I don\u2019t know, but the first step toward answering it is\nbeing clear about what it means.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1277794800.0, "postid": "deforganizing", "internal_links": []}, "management": {"post_title": "Non-Hierarchical Management", "tags": [], "post_content": "Non-Hierarchical Management\n===========================\n\nFebruary 16, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/management)\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou want to get something done. But it\u2019s too big to do it by yourself,\nso you bring in some friends to help out. In your dreams, all your\nfriends just \u201cclick\u201d, understand exactly what it is they\u2019re all supposed\nto do, and do it quickly and effective. In reality, this almost never\nhappens.\n\nIn order for any team to succeed, they need someone helping them all\nstay on track \u2014 someone who we will call a \u201cmanager\u201d.\n\nThe word manager makes many people uncomfortable. It calls up the image\nof a bossman telling you what to do and forcing you to slave away at\ndoing it. That is not effective management.\n\nA better way to think of a manager is as a servant, like an editor or a\npersonal assistant. Everyone wants to be effective; a manager\u2019s job is\nto do everything they can to make that happen. The ideal manager is\nsomeone everyone would want to have.\n\nInstead of the standard \u201corg chart\u201d with a CEO at the top and employees\ngrowing down like roots, turn the whole thing upside down. Employees are\nat the top \u2014 they\u2019re the ones who actually get stuff done \u2014 and managers\nare underneath them, helping them to be more effective. (The CEO, who\nreally does nothing, is of course at the bottom.)\n\nMost guides on management are written for big bosses at big companies,\nnot people starting something new who want their team to be as effective\nas possible. (Hi, startup founders!) So herewith, a guide to effective\nnon-hierarchical management.\n\nPoint 1: Management is a job.\n-----------------------------\n\nManagement is not a typical job. People who manage programmers don\u2019t\nspend their day programming. Nor do they spend their day writing memos.\nIn fact, from the outside, it may appear like they don\u2019t spend their day\ndoing very much at all. Don\u2019t be fooled.\n\nManagement is a serious job. It is incredibly difficult and wildly\nconsuming. As an employee, if you miss a day off work, it\u2019s no big deal:\nsome work doesn\u2019t get done and you (or someone else) has to catch up on\nit later. As a manager, it can become a serious problem \u2014 if you\u2019re not\nworking, then the dozen people you serve aren\u2019t working effectively as\nwell. It makes knocking off work to go to the fair a stressful\nproposition.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be incredibly rewarding. If you do your job\nright, you turn a group of individuals into a team, a group that\u2019s more\neffective than the sum of its parts. Together, you and your team can\nachieve amazing things. As a manager, your task is to serve the team \u2014\nto make it as effective as it can possibly be, even if that means\nstepping on the toes of a few individuals.\n\nOne incredibly popular misconception is that managers are just there to\nprovide \u201cleadership\u201d \u2014 you set everyone up, get them pointed in the\nright direction, and then let them go while you go back to the \u201creal\u201d\nstuff, whether it\u2019s building things yourself, meeting with funders, or\ngoing on the road and talking up your organization. Those are all\nperfectly valid jobs, but they are not management. You have to pick one.\nYou cannot do both.\n\n### Point 1a: Stay organized.\n\nAs the manager, it\u2019s your job to make sure things get done. This means\nyou need a system for making sure things get done. This doesn\u2019t have to\nbe anything fancy or complicated \u2014 a simple todo list will do \u2014 but\nsimply trying to remember or writing yourself a note is not a system.\n\nOne of the nice things about having a system is it actually makes you\nless stressed out. Most people just keep their todo list somewhere in\nthe back of their head. As things pile up, they become harder and harder\nto keep track of, and you become more stressed out about getting them\nall done or forgetting about them.\n\nSimply writing them down on a list makes everything seem more\nmanageable. You can see the things you have to do \u2014 really, there\u2019s not\nquite as many important ones as you thought \u2014 and you can put them in\norder and get that nice burst of satisfaction that comes from crossing\nthem off.\n\nYes, it all sounds like silly, basic stuff, but it\u2019s important. Just\nhaving a list with all the stuff you need to do \u2014 and taking it\nseriously, actually going down it and checking stuff off every single\nday \u2014 is the difference between being a black hole of action items and\nbeing someone who actually Gets Stuff Done.\n\nPoint 2: Know your team.\n------------------------\n\nAs a servant, it\u2019s crucial you know your masters well. You need to know\nwhat they\u2019re good at and what gives them trouble. You need to be able to\ntell when they\u2019re feeling good and when they\u2019re in a rut. And you need\nto have a safe enough relationship with them that they can be honest\nwith you and come to you when they\u2019re in trouble. This is not easy. (You\nhave to be willing to hear bad news about yourself.)\n\nThe most important piece is understanding what people are good at and\nwhat they like doing. A good first step is to just ask them, but often\npeople are wrong or don\u2019t know. So you try giving them different things,\nseeing how they do at them, and adjusting accordingly.\n\nBut in addition to your team\u2019s professional skills, it\u2019s important to\nunderstand their personal goals. However much you may care about the\nwork, at bottom it\u2019s still a job. You need to understand why your team\nmembers took it. Was it because it seemed interesting? Because it seemed\nworthwhile? Because it would give them valuable experience and help them\nget a better job down the road? It\u2019s important that you know, so you can\nmake sure your tasks and expectations are in line with their goals.\n\n### Point 2a: Hire people smarter than you.\n\nYou want the best working for you. People who aren\u2019t just good at their\njob, but people who are also good at *your* job. People you can trust to\nnot just do something right but tell you that the way you suggested\ndoing it was wrong. People you can rely on to get things done if you\njust stay out of their way. At least, that\u2019s the ideal. In practice,\nit\u2019s hard to find people like that and even when you do, they still need\nhelp.\n\nI have never found the traditional methods of hiring \u2014 resum\u00e9s,\ninterviews, quizzes \u2014 to be helpful at all. Instead, I look at two\nthings: what someone has done and whether I enjoy spending time with\nthem. The first shows not just their talent but also their ability to\nexecute. If they haven\u2019t made something interesting, whether as a side\nproject or at a previous job, then they\u2019re probably not worth hiring.\nIt\u2019s not *that* hard to sit down and accomplish something; be wary of\npeople who haven\u2019t.\n\nSimilarly, you need to keep in mind that you\u2019re not just hiring a robot\n\u2014 you\u2019re hiring a flesh-and-blood human who you\u2019re going to need to\nspend a lot of time with during the day. That means they need to be\nsomeone you not just get along with, but enjoy being around. A formal\ninterview, with all its stress and structure and contrivance, is a\npretty bad environment for seeing if you like someone. Instead, just go\nget coffee and chat.\n\n### Point 2b: Be careful when hiring friends.\n\nEveryone wants to work with their friends. After all, you have so much\nfun hanging out after work, why not hang out during work too? So they\nrecruit their friends to work with them. (Or, even worse, they recruit\ntheir lovers.) But being friends is very different from being\ncolleagues. All friends learn ways to adjust themselves to each other \u2014\nwhich tones to use, which subjects to avoid, when to give each other\nspace.\n\nThese go out the window when you\u2019re working together. You can\u2019t just not\nsay things because they\u2019ll get your friend upset. So you say them, and\nthey get upset, and you realize you have no way of dealing with each\nother when you\u2019re like this. It makes working together difficult, to say\nthe least.\n\nThe situation is the same, but vastly worse, with couples. Plus, you\u2019re\nreally screwed when your relationship falls apart under the stress.\n\nIf you do decide to work with people you\u2019re close with, you need to find\na way to put your other relationship \u201con hold\u201d while you work together.\nWhich means you both need to be strong enough to be able to blow up at\neach other at work and then go out for drinks like nothing ever\nhappened. If you can\u2019t do this (and few can), then either give up on the\nrelationship or give up on the job.\n\nThe most extreme form of this, of course, is that you need to be able to\nfire your friend. Just because you like them doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll\nautomatically be a good employee. And, sadly, there\u2019s really no way for\nyou to know in advance. Bad employees are no less disastrous because\nthey\u2019re your friends. Which means that if you hire a friend, you need to\nbe able to fire them.\n\n### Point 2c: Set boundaries.\n\nConversely, don\u2019t become close friends with the people you work with.\nYou have to set some personal boundaries: you\u2019re their manager, not\ntheir friend. Naturally, part of being a manager means that you have to\ntalk to people about their personal problems and possibly even offer\nadvice. After all, it\u2019s your job to make your team effective and if\npersonal problems are distracting from that, you are going to have to\nface someone\u2019s personal problems.\n\nBut be sure to keep these problems at arm\u2019s length. Actually getting\ninvolved in someone\u2019s personal life or otherwise establishing a close\npersonal relationship them is asking for trouble.\n\nPoint 3: Go over the goals together.\n------------------------------------\n\nYour first job as a manager is to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page.\nThe team needs to understand what they\u2019re expected to do, why they\u2019re\ndoing it, and who else is involved (funding it, using it, counting on\nit). If you picked a good team (point 2a), they\u2019ll hear this and find\nholes in your plan and catch things you hadn\u2019t thought of. (Which is\ngood! Together, you can fix it.)\n\nBut real work can\u2019t begin until everyone\u2019s on board with the plan.\n\n### Point 3a: Build a community.\n\nYou\u2019re not managing a bunch of individual employees; you\u2019re managing a\nteam. You\u2019re all trying to accomplish the same goal. It\u2019s the manager\u2019s\njob to make sure everyone\u2019s comfortable with each other. (Hint: Those\ndumb break-the-ice games do not make people *more* comfortable.) And\nwhile there\u2019s obviously a lot of feedback you need to give people\none-on-one (*never* chew people out in front of a group), you should try\nto do a lot in front of the team as well.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fall into a trap where you\u2019re just giving feedback\nindividually. The result is that everyone feels isolated, not knowing\nwhere their work fits in to the bigger picture. Providing opportunities\nfor everyone to see what everyone else is up to is crucial to making\nyour team actually feel like it\u2019s a community, instead of just a group\nof your friends. (First law of friendship drift: Just because you like\ntwo people doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll automatically like each other.)\n\nIt\u2019s also a good opportunity to set a tone. You want people to treat\neach other like friends and colleagues, not backstabbing assholes or\nbickering siblings. As my friend Clay comments:\n\n> I have a \u201cno asshole rule\u201d which is really simple: I really don\u2019t want\n> to work with assholes. So if you\u2019re an asshole and you work on my\n> team, I\u2019m going to fire you. Now, if the whole team says \u201cgosh, that\u2019s\n> awful. We want to work with as many assholes as we can!\u201d then we have\n> a simple solution. I\u2019ll fire me! (FYI: The \u201cNo Asshole Rule\u201d is a\n> book. I thought it was actually a pretty good book as far as Business\n> books go. As far as I\u2019m concerned, anybody could stand to read 100\n> pages giving them the MBA Book cover they need to say to their boss:\n> let\u2019s get the assholes out of here.)\n\nBut a community is about more than just tone, there\u2019s process as well.\nYou need to figure out how your team members work and how you can get\nthem to work together. Some people like constant human feedback; others\nlike locking themselves in a room for a couple hours and just getting\nsomething done. Everyone has their own habits and styles. Your job is to\nfind an appropriate mix that makes everyone as productive they can be.\n\nPoint 4: Assign responsibility.\n-------------------------------\n\nFirst, break the plan up into parts. Make sure everybody understands the\nparts.\n\nSecond, find a team member who wants to do each part. The key word here\nis *wants* \u2014 some things just have to get done, it\u2019s true, but things\nwill get done much better by people who want to do them.\n\nOne of the weird facts of life is that for just about everything you\nhate doing, there is someone out there who loves doing it. (There are\neven people who get a real kick out of cleaning toilets.) You may not\ncurrently employ them and you may not be able to hire them, but the is\nthe goal worth striving toward.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to realize that a lot of what makes a task\nattractive or unattractive is outside the task itself. Managing the\ncompany\u2019s accounting books at first seems like a pretty uninteresting\njob. But when you realize it makes you indispensable and gives you\nauthority over how all the money is spent, it suddenly seems a little\nmore exciting. Use your knowledge from point 2 to structure tasks in a\nway that\u2019s attractive to your team members.\n\n### Point 4a: Vary responsibilities.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that most people like variety in their\nwork. It\u2019s very tempting to think of someone as \u201cthe finance guy\u201d and\njust give them all the finance-related tasks. But in any organization\nthere\u2019s lots of different kinds of things to do and a wide mix of people\nto do it. Many people will appreciate the opportunity to switch up the\nkinds of things they do.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that this is inefficient, that by having one guy\ndo all the finance tasks they\u2019ll become an expert in it and the finance\ntasks will get done more effectively. And there\u2019s definitely some truth\nin it. But one of the best ways to be inefficient is to make your team\nunhappy. If doing something new makes someone enjoy their job more,\nit\u2019ll be well worth the cost in time of them having to learn how to do\nit.\n\nEven better, their fresh perspective might just help you make\nimprovements you\u2019d never thought of before.\n\n### Point 4b: Delegate responsibility.\n\nAs the manager, it\u2019s a continual temptation to keep important jobs for\nyourself. After all, they\u2019re usually fun to do and doggone-it they\u2019re\n*important*, you can\u2019t risk them on somebody else! Resist the\ntemptation.\n\nFor one thing, taking jobs for yourself is one way of distracting\nyourself from having to do actual management (point 1). But more\nimportantly, you\u2019ll never be able to develop your team if you keep all\nthe real responsibility for yourself. Sure, Jony may not be as good at\nmeeting funders as you, but a lot of that\u2019s because she\u2019s never gotten a\nchance to practice. If it\u2019s something she wants to do (point 2), take\nher along and give him a chance to learn.\n\nPoint 5: Clear obstacles.\n-------------------------\n\nThis is the bulk of what non-hierarchical management is about. You\u2019ve\ngot good people, they\u2019ve got good responsibilities. Now it\u2019s your job to\ndo everything in your power to help them get them done.\n\nA good way to start is just by asking people what they need. Is their\noffice too noisy? Did they get confused about something you said? Are\nthey stuck on a particular problem? Are they overwhelmed with work? It\u2019s\nyour job to help them out: get them a quieter office, clarify things,\nfind them advice or answers, shift some stuff off their plate. They\nshouldn\u2019t be wasting time with things that annoy them; that\u2019s your job.\n\nBut you have to be proactive as well. People tend to suffer quietly,\nboth because they don\u2019t want to come whining to you and just because\nwhen you\u2019re stuck in a rut all your attention is focused on the rut. A\nkey part of being a manager is checking in with people, pointing out\nthat they\u2019re stuck in a rut, and gently helping them out.\n\n### Point 5a: Prioritize.\n\nAt any given time, there\u2019s lots of stuff that needs to be done. Part of\nyour job is helping people decide what to tackle first. You don\u2019t want\nto be *too* didactic about it \u2014 people like choice and variety, they\u2019re\nnot always so happy when you just give them one instruction after\nanother \u2014 but even that\u2019s usually far preferable to being overwhelmed\nwith stuff.\n\nThe best prioritization relationship is a dialogue: \u201cOK, what\u2019s next?\u201d\nsomeone asks. \u201cWell, what about building the new sprocket management\nengine?\u201d \u201cUgh, I\u2019m too tired for that today.\u201d \u201cOK, how about cleaning\nthe frobnitz?\u201d \u201cBo-ring.\u201d \u201cOh, I know! We need someone to document the\ndoohickey.\u201d \u201cOoh, perfect \u2014 thanks!\u201d\n\n### Point 5b: Fight procrastination.\n\nProcrastination is the crop blight of the office-work world. It affects\njust about everyone and it\u2019s very hard to fight alone. The single best\nway to stop procrastination is to sit down with someone and come up with\nthe next concrete step they have to take and then start doing it\ntogether. There\u2019s something magical about having another person sit down\nwith you and do something that can overcome procrastination\u2019s natural\nresistance. And once you get someone started, momentum can often carry\nthem through the rest of the day.\n\nEven if all you do is help people overcome procrastination, you will be\nwell worth it.\n\nPoint 6: Give feedback.\n-----------------------\n\nWhite-collar work is lonely. You sit at a desk, staring at a screen,\npoking at buttons. It\u2019s easy to get lost and off-track and depressed.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to check in and see how things are doing. Not\nonly does it give you a chance to see how people are doing (point 5), it\ngives you a chance to see how things are coming and gently steer them\nback on course if they\u2019ve drifted from what you\u2019ve intended.\n\n### Point 6a: Don\u2019t micromanage.\n\nRemember, your job isn\u2019t to tell people *how* to do things; it\u2019s to help\nthem get it done. Sometimes this means helping them figure out how to do\nit, but in general you should assume that you work with smart people and\nthey\u2019ll be able to handle it themselves. Again, be a servant, not a\nboss.\n\nStudies consistently show that people are much happier and more\nproductive when they have control over the way they work. Never take\nthat away.\n\nPoint 7: Don\u2019t make decisions (unless you *really* have to).\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs manager, people will often come to you to make decisions or resolve\ndisputes. It\u2019s very tempting, with people looking up at you for\nguidance, to want to give your sage advice. But the fact is, even if (or\nespecially if) as a manager you\u2019re held up on a pedestal, you probably\nknow less about the question than anyone else on the team.\n\nThe worst managers don\u2019t just make decisions when people come to them,\nthey parachute in and start dictating tiny details. The urge to do this\ncan be overwhelming, but there are few things more disastrous to morale.\nIf you really have to give input, couch it as such. And if people fight\nback, know when to step back and say \u201clook, you\u2019re the expert. I was\njust giving my two cents.\u201d (Hint: It\u2019s right after they start fighting\nback.)\n\nThe best managers use these opportunities not to dictate an answer, but\nto have a Socratic dialogue to help figure out what the best answer is.\nOften when people are stuck on something, they really just need someone\nelse to talk things over with, either for assistance or validation.\nHere\u2019s your chance to help.\n\nPoint 8: Fire ineffective people.\n---------------------------------\n\nFiring people is hard. It\u2019s probably the hardest thing you\u2019ll ever do.\nPeople go to absurd lengths to try and make it easier (\u201cwe\u2019ll just try\nhim out for a month and see how it goes\u201d is a common one) but they never\nreally help. You just have to bite the bullet and let people go. It\u2019s\nyour job. If you can\u2019t do it, find someone else.\n\nFiring people isn\u2019t just about saving money, or petty things like that.\nIt\u2019s the difference between a great organization and a failure.\nInefective people drag everyone else down to their level. They make it\nso that you can\u2019t take pride in what you\u2019re doing, so that you dread\ngoing into work in the morning, so that you can\u2019t rely on the other\npieces of the project getting done. And assholes, no matter how talented\nthey may be, are even worse. Conversely, there are few things more fun\nthan working hard with a really nice, talented group of people.\n\nYou are never going to be able to tell whether someone is going to work\nout in advance. Assholes are sometimes easy to spot, but people can have\ngreat resumes, solid references, a charming interview style, and still\nbe total failures. And the worst part is, there will always be excuses\nfor their failures. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d they\u2019ll say, \u201cit\u2019s just that I\u2019ve\nbeen really sick this week. I\u2019ve been distracted with family things.\nI\u2019ve been traveling. Look, I\u2019m sorry. I promise I\u2019ll do better this\nweek.\u201d I\u2019ve said them all myself.\n\nIf you\u2019re not getting things done, you can always come up with excuses\nfor why. Competent people get things done anyway. Ineffective ones let\nthe excuses pile up. They\u2019re not going to leave themselves. You have to\npull the trigger.\n\nPoint 9: Give away the credit.\n------------------------------\n\nAs the team\u2019s manager, there will be many opportunities where people\nwill want to give you credit. And getting credit is nice, it makes you\nfeel good. So you start coming up with excuses for why you deserve it,\neven though you didn\u2019t do any of the work. \u201cWell, it was my vision,\u201d you\nwill say. \u201cI was the one who made it all happen.\u201d\n\nBut think of all those talented people slaving away at desks. They were\nthe ones who actually made it happen. Make sure they get the credit. And\nnot in a facetious, \u201cthanks to all the little people way\u201d. No, you need\nto own up. You are the assistant. They did all the work. As Clay says,\n\u201cA manager\u2019s worst enemy is his or her own ego.\u201d\n\nPoint 10: You\u2019re probably not cut out for this.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSpending your days doing grunt work for people who are smarter than you.\nObsessing over their mood and personal problems. Turning down all\nopportunities to take credit or get attention so you can continue to\nwork as a servant. Does this really sound like a job you want?\n\nProbably not. Few people are cut out for it. It\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s\nincredibly stressful. It\u2019s not at all glamorous.\n\nBut it\u2019s vitally important. A team without a manager is doomed to be an\nineffective team. So if you can\u2019t do it, find somebody else.\n\n*Thanks to [Clay\nJohnson](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/people/cjohnson/) and [Emmett\nShear](http://blog.emmettshear.com/) for their comments on drafts of\nthis essay.*\n", "external_links": ["http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/people/cjohnson/", "http://blog.emmettshear.com/"], "time": 1234771200.0, "postid": "management", "internal_links": []}, "intheblue": {"post_title": "Reagan, Star Wars, and the End of the Cold War", "tags": [], "post_content": "Reagan, Star Wars, and the End of the Cold War\n==============================================\n\nMarch 13, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intheblue)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![Book\ncover](image1_intheblue)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743200233)\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why building technology to defend against nuclear\nmissiles is tricky. First, there\u2019s the obvious difficulty of shooting at\na moving target \u2014 like a bullet shooting a bullet. Then there\u2019s the fact\nthat whatever device is defending you must itself be well defended, or\nelse the enemy can simply take it out. And then there\u2019s the nasty fact\nthat with nuclear war, near-perfect defense is necessary \u2014 even a single\nfailure can cause enormous damage.\n\nWhat is hard is explaining why, despite this, so many people took the\nidea so seriously. That\u2019s the question Frances FitzGerald takes up in\n*Way Out There In The Blue*, in which she uses the \u201cStar Wars\u201d\ninitiative as a prism with which to understand the Reagan\nadministration. Combined with Rick Perlstein\u2019s forthcoming *Nixonland*,\nthe books provide allegorical insight into our current government: Bush\nII has combined the criminality of Nixon with the intellectual emptiness\nof Reagan.\n\nRonald Reagan was an actor. Even when off the set, he recited polished\nlines and played up a well-practiced demeanor. Indeed, he appears to\nhave no inner life whatsoever. No one can be found to whom Ronald Reagan\never \u201copened up\u201d; even his wife commented that \u201cThere\u2019s a wall around\nhim \u2026 even I feel that barrier.\u201d As president, he was given the\nequivalent of shooting instructions specifying exactly where he was\nsupposed to be every hour of the day and when he attended public events\ntoe marks were chalked on the ground to indicate where he should stand.\n\nConsidering the state of the American political system, having an actor\nfor a President is perhaps not the worst idea. But what was problematic\nwas that nobody \u2014 including Reagan\u2019s closest aides \u2014 seemed to realize\nthat that was what they were getting. For months they were continually\nshocked that Reagan refused to ever make a decision or take an action on\nany issue whatsoever. Instead, they watched dumbly as he simply listened\nto what he was told and nodded politely. When two of his subordinates\ndisagreed, he was uncomfortable, but he steadfastly refused to\nintervene.\n\nThe result was that decisions ended up getting made by whoever was\naround \u2014 Nancy Reagan, his wife; Michael Deaver, his aide in charge of\npublic relations; etc. Reagan\u2019s top people, such as his cabinet\nofficials, frightened that they were actually making policy without any\nsupervision, kept this fact secret from their staffs and the public\nuntil they all published their kiss-and-tell memoirs after Reagan had\nleft office. Even more shocking, Reagan didn\u2019t seem to mind when the\nmembers of this group changed. One day Reagan\u2019s inner circle informed\nhim that they were leaving and bringing the Treasury Secretary in to\ntake their place. Reagan simply thanked them for their service.\n\nThere was one thing Reagan did seem to care about (aside from politely\nanswering his fan mail): speeches. Reagan would rewrite his own\nspeeches, removing abstract verbiage and adding homespun stories. And it\nwas out of this concern that he stumbled into launching the Star Wars\ninitiative.\n\nAfter many years of right-wing propaganda about a \u201cwindow of\nvulnerability\u201d in our arms race with the Soviet Union, the Pentagon\ndeveloped the MX missile series to ensure American superiority. The\nproblem was where to put them. The MX missiles were designed to protect\nagainst the Soviets simply destroying all of our missiles, so they could\nnot simply be put out in the open or the Soviets would simply destroy\nthem as well. A variety of Rube Goldberg-like ideas were proposed to\nsolve the problem.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation, the military concluded the best solution\nwas what came to be called \u201cthe racetrack\u201d: the missiles would be put on\nhuge underground circular tracks, with little launching stations cut\nsporadically in the track. There would be several times more launching\nstations than missiles, so the Soviets would not know which stations to\nattack. But, to verify compliance with arms treaties, the stations could\nbe opened so that the Soviets could see which ones contained missiles\nfrom space.\n\nThe problem was that the racetracks would need to be huge and the only\npractical space for such a thing was in Utah. The Mormon Church was\nunderstandably unhappy about having a huge nuclear missile field being\nbuilt near them and thus the powerful Republicans from that region of\nthe country scuttled the plan.\n\nOther ideas were tried \u2014 the racetrack was converted to a straight line\nsystem, then to a configuration known as \u201cDense Pack\u201d in which the\nmissiles were all placed close together, in the hopes that all the\nmissiles coming to attack them would blow each other up and perhaps\nspare some of our missiles. Another plan, known as \u201cBig Bird\u201d, had the\nmissiles flying overhead on large transport planes, but it was scrapped\nwhen technicians raised concerns about the wings falling off. Another\nproposal involved hiding the missiles as normal luggage on cross-country\npassenger trains. It got to the point where the best idea was literally\nknown as DUMB \u2014 deep underground missile basing \u2014 in which the missiles\nwould be loaded on corkscrews which would drill down underground.\nFinally, they decided just to deploy the missiles in\nsuperficially-hardened housing, even though this meant they could be\neasily destroyed.\n\nAt the same time, a mass popular movement for a nuclear freeze was\ngrowing, encompassing college students, churches, and many unpoliticized\ncitizens. Reagan\u2019s credibility on foreign policy was slipping away while\nbooks and movies and massive protests scared citizens into thinking\nabout the unthinkable prospect of a nuclear holocaust. The Democrats\nwere seizing power and mindshare and a nuclear freeze bill passed the\nHouse. Clearly something had to be done.\n\nMissile defense seemed like the perfect alternative. It didn\u2019t require\nany diplomatic changes or sacrificing any weapons development \u2014 indeed,\nit allowed for more spending on research. But it allowed Reagan to use\nthe language of the doves \u2014 a sincere desire to rid the world of the\nscourge of nuclear war. So when a Reagan aide proposed the idea (which\nthe aide conceived of as a chip to be bargained away for with the\nSoviets), Reagan seized upon the idea and worked it into a speech at the\nnext available opportunity.\n\nThere was just one problem: nobody had any idea how to make it work. The\nmost prominent right-wing scientist, Edward Teller, was very excited\nabout a new technology in which a high-powered X-ray could be sent along\na rod to vaporize small objects. Teller proposed a large satellite with\nsuch rods sticking out of it, a device that came to be known as the\n\u201cspace-based sea urchin\u201d. What happens when the Soviets target the\ndefense? he was asked. Teller didn\u2019t seem to have considered the\nquestion but, unfazed, came back the next day suggesting the defense\nweapons be stored underwater and \u201cpop up\u201d when missiles were overhead.\n\nSuch debates disguised the fact that no actual missile defense\ntechnology existed or was likely to for a long, long time. Tactics and\ncosts for disintegration rays and sea urchins could be discussed\nendlessly, but such discussion was irrelevant, as nobody knew how to\nbuild the key components. But this fact was carefully kept from\npoliticians and the press who, ignorant of the science, continued to\ndiscuss missile defense as if it was a serious proposal. Thus, a\nmajority of Americans were convinced that scientific ingenuity would\nfind a way to protect the country \u2014 indeed, they believed it already\nhad.\n\nBut the sheen of a someday-to-be-developed missile defense system could\nnot last forever \u2014 Reagan needed something more repeatable to boost his\nflagging poll numbers, especially in the wake of such scandals as\nIran-contra. The result was an ongoing series of carefully-spun summits\nwith the Soviets, in which the President claimed to be making good\nprogress on negotiations for arms reduction. (That negotiated arms\nreduction could serve as a replacement for a missile defense initiative\nnever seemed to occur to the Reagan administration; it was not exactly a\ngroup prone to analytical self-reflection.)\n\nOn the Russian side, Mikhail Gorbachev, a brilliant and daring new\npolitician, had come to power. Gorbachev seemed more like an American\nfigure than a Russian one \u2014 he spoke plainly, made daring moves toward\npeace, and played well for the cameras. For much of the following years,\nGorbachev had higher poll numbers in the US than Reagan did. Washington\nwas said to have been swept away with \u201cGorby fever\u201d and \u201cGorbymania\u201d.\n\nGorbachev unilaterally made a series of striking reforms in both\ndomestic and foreign policy. He offered the US a wide variety of\nconcessions in disarmament talks, insisting only that the US stop the\nSDI program (the one principle which Reagan refused to concede). Then he\nbegun the process of glasnost, increasing the freedom of the press and\nallowing a left-wing reform movement to develop. As part of this, he\nfreed dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov, who proceeded to tell the\nmedia that SDI was a bluff that the US could never successfully develop.\nShortly thereafter, Gorbachev was even willing to budge on that,\nallowing the US to continue SDI. Meanwhile, he begun the process of\nperestroika, reforming the Russian political and economic system to\nincrease the scope of democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, Reagan\u2019s side continued to bungle or misunderstand all of\nGorbachev\u2019s moves, using his disarmament proposals for little more than\nPR victories at home and continuing to insist his reforms were merely\ncosmetic attempts to prop up the old system. Reagan and Gorbachev\ncontinued to hold summits with plentiful photo opportunities, but little\nin the way of actual agreement was ever reached.\n\nIndeed, Reagan actually made Gorbachev\u2019s reforms much more difficult by\ndoing things like giving speeches demanding the General Secretary \u201ctear\ndown this wall\u201d. Such speeches only lent credence to the conservatives\nwho charged that Gorbachev was simply doing the West\u2019s dirty work from\nthe inside.\n\nYet despite Reagan\u2019s ineptitude, Gorbachev\u2019s reforms took hold \u2014 perhaps\neven more strongly than he had intended \u2014 and the old Soviet system\nbegan to fall apart. Democratic parties were elected, troops were\nwithdrawn, and the wall finally came down.\n\nBut Americans were reluctant to believe that the destruction of the\nSoviet system had come from the reformers within it. Instead, they\nretrospectively lionized Reagan as the man whose tough talk had made the\nsystem come apart.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743200233)\n\n\n[image1_intheblue]: image1_intheblue.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743200233", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743200233"], "time": 1173769200.0, "postid": "intheblue", "internal_links": []}, "classicalmusic": {"post_title": "In Offense of Classical Music", "tags": [], "post_content": "In Offense of Classical Music\n=============================\n\nJune 20, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/classicalmusic)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI recently had to sit through a performance of Bach\u2019s *Well-Tempered\nClavier* at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (it was the conductor\u2019s\nfarewell concert). At first it was simply boring, but as I listened more\ncarefully, it grew increasingly painful, until it became excruciatingly\nso. I literally began tearing my hair out and trying to cut my skin with\nmy nails (there were large red marks when the performance was finally\nover). The pianist, I was certain, kept flubbing the notes and getting\nthe timing off. But few around me seemed to agree. \u201cWell, he certainly\nplays it differently from Gould,\u201d was the most they could say.\n\nThe audience, like that of private libraries and the FOX News Channel,\nwas decidedly old. I don\u2019t recall seeing *anyone* who looked younger\nthan thirty. And, aside from thoughts of this whole\norchestras-playing-classical-music thing dying out, it made me wonder:\nwhat\u2019s so great about classical music?\n\nAsk the old folks there and they\u2019ll tell you that nothing really\ncompares. Listen to the stuff on the radio today and it\u2019s all simply\nrepetitive melodies with stupid lyrics. And the thing is, they\u2019re right:\nthe stuff on the radio does suck for the most part. But that\u2019s not\nreally a fair comparison.\n\nWhen I listen to good modern music, it takes my heart in its hands and\nplays with it as it pleases \u2014 makes me soar, makes me sad, excited, and\nmad. But when I listen to classical music, at most it simply occupies my\nbrain for a while. Is this simply a flaw in my perception or has music\nreally improved?\n\nI think it\u2019s possible to argue that music is actually getting better. As\nhumans, we clearly share a number of genetically-encoded similarities,\nperhaps with some variation. For example, we almost all have two eyes,\nalthough in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Imagine that we are\nsimilarly endowed with some shared sense of musical appreciation (or,\nput another way, emotional susceptibility). We all fall for the same\nmusical things, again with some variation.\n\nIf this is the case (and while I can\u2019t really prove it, it seems at\nleast plausible to me that it is), then there would indeed be objective\nstandards for measuring music: better music would be more appreciated by\nthe \u201caverage person\u201d or the majority of people or some such. And if\nthere are objective standards for measuring music, then music can get\nbetter.\n\nAnd, if we again imagine that what\u2019s appreciated in music isn\u2019t simply\nrandom, that it involves certain traits (which seems pretty clear,\nalthough again hard to prove), then not only can music get better, but\nit probably *will*. Musicians will listen to old music, the majority of\nthem will enjoy the good songs of the past, and they\u2019ll try to build\nupon and improve that good material, following its patterns, creating\neven better music. And the next generation will do the same, from a\nfurther along starting point.\n\nDoes this prove that the latest Aimee Mann album (*The Forgotten Arm*)\nis the best work of music yet to be created by humans? Of course not.\nBut it does mean it\u2019s at least *possible*, that I\u2019m not completely crazy\nfor thinking so.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1150786800.0, "postid": "classicalmusic", "internal_links": []}, "scenes2": {"post_title": "Scenes 2", "tags": [], "post_content": "Scenes 2\n========\n\nAugust 17, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/scenes2)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter a long delay, we\u2019re finally allowed to board the plane.

We had no money and no members\nand not much of a plan for how to get them. We wrote up long proposals\nfor big donors on why they should write us checks, and tried negotiating\nwith electoral candidates on why they should send us members, but\nneither of these were particularly successful. Then Jon Stewart attacked\nJim Cramer.\n\nCramer came to symbolize the foolishness and vapidity of the media in\nthe face of the financial crisis. His blatantly buffoonish cluelessness\n(\u201c*Don\u2019t move your money from Bear! That\u2019s just being silly! Don\u2019t be\nsilly!*\u201d) were the epitome of a press that championed the housing bubble\nand fumbled the crash. We were giddy about the press getting their day\nin scorn, but we wanted to accomplish positive change as well. So we hit\nupon the idea of starting a petition to demand CNBC hire someone who was\n*right* about the housing crisis.\n\nWe spread the word to friends and bloggers and before we knew it we had\nnearly 20,000 signatures \u2014 20,000 new members. It was quite the start.\n\nA couple months later, frustrated that Norm Coleman wouldn\u2019t drop his\nspurious legal challenges against Al Franken being named a Senator, we\nstarted NormDollar.com. We asked people to donate a dollar each day Norm\nColeman didn\u2019t drop out of the race, money we\u2019d spend electing\nprogressive candidates. It was featured on *Hardball* and throughout the\npolitical press. We also videotaped Norm\u2019s donors\u2019 reactions when we\ntold them about the program. But my favorite was when we presented Norm\nwith a big novelty check for him to sign, representing all the money\nhe\u2019d raised for progressives.\n\nNow we had money too.\n\nI came back from my month offline to find we were raising money for TV\nads \u2014 running ads in DC pressuring representatives to support the public\nhealth care option, asking whether they\u2019d sold out to their insurance\nindustry campaign contributors. And when Sen. Ben Nelson started a\ncampaign to stall the health care bill, we filmed an ad with Mike\nSnider. Mike talked plainly to the camera about how, as owner of the\nlocal Syzzlyn Skillet, he received a call from his insurers saying they\nwere raising his rates by 42%. \u201cI can\u2019t afford that!\u201d he exclaimed. And\nthen to hear his own Senator was trying to prevent health care reform?\n\nMike was just an average guy who made a real political difference. After\nwe started airing our ad, Ben Nelson\u2019s spokesperson tried to denounce\nhim and the Senator himself called Mike and asked to see his health care\nbills. Mike was a guest on *The Rachel Maddow Show* and his restaurant\nhas become a base of operations for the local political community.\nMike\u2019s story was so powerful that Ben Nelson was forced to put up his\nown ads directly responding to it \u2014 even though Nelson isn\u2019t up for\nreelection in years \u2014 in which he (ridiculously) calls Mike a lying DC\npolitician.\n\nMike\u2019s story really inspired me as to the difference just one person\ncould make, but I never thought that person would be me. When my\nSenator, Ted Kennedy, passed away, I wanted to honor his memory by\nfighting for the causes he fought for. His last request had been a\nletter to the Massachusetts legislature asking them to change the law\nand let a replacement be appointed to his seat to continue his fight for\nuniversal health care. Without the change, the seat would stay vacant\nfor five months while an election could be scheduled \u2014 and the next five\nmonths will be crucial.\n\nWith the rest of the (growing) PCCC team, we came up with a plan to\nlaunch a petition asking the legislature to honor that request. We sent\nout an email asking people to sign and tell their friends. Within a few\ndays, we had 20,000 signatures. I was blown away \u2014 clearly people cared.\n\nI\u2019d promised to deliver the signatures on Monday, without really\nthinking about what that entailed. I called the office of the Senate\nPresident and Speaker of the House to ask when I could come by and film\na short video of the petitions being dropped off. The President of the\nSenate\u2019s office blew me off, insisting that under no circumstances were\ncameras allowed in their office and saying that the President simply\ncouldn\u2019t meet with me. So we decided to make the delivery something they\ncouldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nWe emailed our list to ask people in the area to show up on the State\nHouse steps at 11am Monday. Then we emailed the press and asked them to\nget there at 11:15. I stayed up all night the night before, feeding\npaper into the printer trying to print out 20,000 names. Then I grabbed\na stack and headed to the State House.\n\nThe stack \u2014 600 sheets or so \u2014 kept trying to fall over and blow away\nand at the State House there were only a couple friends who were loaning\nme their camera. We decided to go in and scope out President Murray\u2019s\noffice. When we came back, our members started arriving: old ladies with\ntheir grandchildren, college students, and everyone in between. The\nmedia started pressing closer: a photographer for the *Herald*, a\ncameraman for Fox. Microphones kept being shoved in my face and people\nkept asking me to spell my name. I hefted the stack of petitions and\nkept repeating why I was here.\n\nLocal TV news isn\u2019t exactly known for its crack reporters, but I have to\nsay I was impressed by Janet Wu. She didn\u2019t just ask me the standard\nquestions, but kept pushing me on the hard stuff, barking responses at\nme, not letting me off the hook. The other reporters smelled blood and\njoined in. Soon I was at the center of a full scrum of cameras and\nmicrophones \u2014 surrounded on all sides, every local TV station there. I\nlike to think I comported myself well: I didn\u2019t get angry or flustered,\nI refused to me taken off-message, I kept stressing that this was about\ndoing what the people wanted.\n\n(Later, away from the cameras, Wu was a completely different person.\n\u201cHey there, little guy,\u201d she cooed at a grandchild. \u201cHey, it\u2019s OK, you\ncan talk to me.\u201d Actually, I thought the kid might have the right idea\nby staying quiet.)\n\nAt some point all the cameras dematerialized. \u201cOK, go in,\u201d someone said.\n\u201cJust pretend we\u2019re not here.\u201d They\u2019d all rematerialized down the\nstreet, to film us marching into the capitol, stack of signatures in\nhand.\n\nBelieve it or not, it\u2019s not easy to walk into the state capitol holding\n600 pieces of paper with TV cameras in front of you and a crowd of\nsupporters behind. I kept wondering where to look and trying not to lose\nthe rest of the crowd. Who knows how that footage came out. And when I\ngot up the steps the reporters dematerialized again and rematerialized\ninside at the Senate President\u2019s office, to film us marching down the\nhallway. We entered her office and all crowded in \u2014 I didn\u2019t think we\nwere all going to fit, but we just barely did. The receptionist \u2014 in the\nmiddle of a phone call \u2014 looked a bit flustered. We waited patiently.\nSoon a broad-shouldered man in a suit came out. \u201cThanks so much for the\npetitions,\u201d he said, taking them from me. \u201cThe proposal will go through\nthe usual process. He turned to head out. I was dumbstruck.\n\nBut, bravely, one of the older women spoke up. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cThe\nnormal process? Isn\u2019t this a matter of some urgency?\u201d \u201cAll I can say is\nit will go through the usual process.\u201d Those women wouldn\u2019t let him go.\nBut eventually he did, looking the perfect image of the arrogant\nunconcerned Boston pol, and Janet Wu stuck a microphone in my face. \u201cDo\nyou feel satisfied?\u201d she asked. I started to speak but she interrupted.\n\u201cWait. OK, go again: Do you feel satisfied?\u201d\n\nOutside, a cameraman turned the bright lights on one of the older woman.\nShe was saying, far more clearly and convincingly than me, that no, she\nwasn\u2019t satisfied. That this was an important issue and she wanted to be\nheard. I was so glad she came.\n\nAnd then the press and the supporters dematerialized again. I was left,\nonce again, alone with just my friends. We stood in the hallway trying\nto process what just happened. We caught the man who\u2019d taken the\npetitions as he was coming out of the office. \u201cSo, what is your actual\ntitle?\u201d I asked. \u201cDirector of Communications,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd where is the Senate President really?\u201d asked a friend. \u201cOh, she\u2019s\nin Russia,\u201d he explained. \u201cRussia?\u201d \u201cYeah, she\u2019s helping with a\nnonprofit to assist orphaned children. Pre-scheduled trip. She does it\nevery year.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re saying she can\u2019t meet with us because she\u2019s in\nRussia saving orphans?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty incredible excuse.\u201d We\nall laughed. He headed off down the hallway.\n\n\u201cWait, one more thing,\u201d a friend called after him. \u201cWhere\u2019s a good place\naround here we can get some lunch?\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nPlease, [sign our\npetition](http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5649/t/4923/content.jsp?content_KEY=2762&tag=hk1_asw).\n", "external_links": ["http://boldprogressives.org/", "http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5649/t/4923/content.jsp?content_KEY=2762&tag=hk1_asw"], "time": 1252393200.0, "postid": "pcccstory", "internal_links": []}, "toc": {"post_title": "A Theory of Change", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Theory of Change\n==================\n\nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/toc)\n\n* * * * *\n\nPeople want to make the world a better place. But how? Barack Obama says\nI can change the direction of the country by voting for him. Al Gore\nsays I can solve the climate crisis with a letter to the editor. MoveOn\nsays I can stop George W. Bush by signing their petition. Perhaps, but\nthese requests ring hollow. How is writing a letter to my local paper\ngoing to stop the polar ice caps from melting?\n\nMost groups have a couple steps at the end (switch to alternative\nenergy, stopping carbon from being emitted, preventing global warming)\nand a couple steps at the beginning (write your congressman and send a\nletter to the paper) but in between they seem to expect that some kind\nof miracle will happen. They\u2019re missing the concrete steps in between,\nthe actual way we get from here to there.\n\nIn the nonprofit world, such a plan is called a Theory of Change. And\nthe reason they\u2019re so rare is because they\u2019re dreadfully hard to come\nby. The world has no shortage of big problems, but it\u2019s hard to think of\nways we might realistically solve them. Instead, the same few things \u2014\nvote, preach, march \u2014 get trotted out again and again.\n\nFor over a year now, I\u2019ve been looking for theories of change for\npolitics. And I\u2019ve found a few that I think just might work. But I can\u2019t\npull them off by myself. So here they are, in case someone out there\nwants to help.\n\nThe Netroots Congress\n---------------------\n\nHere\u2019s how you get elected to Congress today: First, you make friends\nwith a bunch of wealthy people, being sure to agree with them on all the\nimportant issues. Then you take their money and hire a well-connected\nWashington, D.C. campaign manager. The campaign manager shows you how to\nask for more money and then gives it to his partner, who makes some TV\nand radio ads and runs them in your district. They keep doing this until\nyour money runs out and then, if you\u2019re lucky, you get more votes than\nthe other guy.\n\nBecause of the netroots, it\u2019s now possible to change the first part of\nthis story. Instead of raising your money from conservative or centrist\nrich people, you can now raise money from progressive people over the\nInternet. So instead of candidates who all agree that telephone\ncompanies shouldn\u2019t be punished for spying on Americans, you can have\ncandidates who think every American should have free health care.\n\nConcretely, you\u2019d ask people who want to do this to sign up to pay \\$X a\nmonth. Then you\u2019d go around looking for candidates (or potential\ncandidates) who genuinely believe in progressive principles. When you\nfind them, you give them the money, and now they actually have a chance\nof getting elected.\n\nBonus: Get more money by fiercely promoting how bad the incumbent is or\nhow good the challenger is.\n\nThis sort of thing has been done haphazardly and achieved some real\nsuccesses. Donna Edwards, for example, is now a member of Congress. The\nidea here is to institutionalize it.\n\nThe Plain-Speaking Party\n------------------------\n\nThe last plan changes the first part of the election process I\nmentioned. But you could also try changing the rest of it. Right now, if\nyou want to run as a Democrat, your biggest source of funding will be\nthe Democratic Party, especially the Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee (DCCC). To get their money, the DCCC\n[requires](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0501.sullivan.html)\nyou hire one of their friends. Their friends are all corrupt hacks who\nrun the same failed campaigns again and again.\n\nThis is normally thought to be unavoidable because you can\u2019t win without\nmoney and you can\u2019t get money without the DCCC. What this misses is that\nyou don\u2019t need as much money if you\u2019re running a radically innovative\ncampaign.\n\nInstead of raising money to run ads, do a PR stunt that will get lots of\nfree media and word-of-mouth attention. Center your campaign around a\nclear proposal that most of the public will support but no other\npolitician would dare touch. Be forceful and refuse to back down in the\nface of attacks from the press or your opponent. And, above all, always\nmake it clear to people that you\u2019re an average person, not an average\npolitician. No boring speeches, no political buzzwords, no meaningless\ncliches.\n\nIt\u2019s never been seriously tried outside of the movies, but I expect that\nthe effect would be electrifying. The media would cover your every\nentertaining move and money would flow in from around the Internet. The\n60% that doesn\u2019t vote in midterms would start to reconsider. Hell, Ron\nPaul attempted half this strategy while being completely nuts and he\nstill received enough money and volunteers to win five House seats.\n\nIf you can actually win an election this way, you\u2019ll be able to get\ndozens more to follow your lead the next time around. Pretty soon, it\u2019ll\nbe a movement.\n\nSlate Cards\n-----------\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the President and it\u2019s not just about Congress.\n(It\u2019s also not just about the US, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on\ntoday.) Local elections also have an impact, if only the people who win\nthem often go on to even bigger positions. (Who in Wassila, Alaska\nthought they might be picking a future president?)\n\nMost local races don\u2019t get a lot of attention and most people don\u2019t do\nmuch research on them. Which makes them much easier to influence that\nbigger races. Imagine a site where you gave it your email address and\nzip code and every time there was a local election, it\u2019d send you the\nprogressive candidates to vote for. You could print it out and take it\nto the polls and feel much better about your pick for \u201cregister of\nprobate\u201d.\n\nIn San Francisco, the local papers issue endorsements on all the races\nand each of the candidates they endorse chip in some money to send a\npostcard with the whole endorsement list to every voter. This group\ncould do the same thing. It could also ask folks to chip in a couple\nbucks to help pay for mailing post cards to their neighbors. (Or they\ncould print some out at home.)\n\nShareholder Democracy\n---------------------\n\nSupposedly, corporations aren\u2019t actually controlled by their CEOs. The\nCEOs are instead hired by the shareholders, to run the business that the\nshareholders actually own. A lot of these shares are held by people who\naren\u2019t big fans of business as usual. If they got together they could\nuse their shares to vote for reform.\n\nNow voting on shares is complicated enough that most people don\u2019t\nbother, but increasingly votes are being moved onto the Internet. It\u2019s\npossible for an aspiring organization to build some software that could\nautomatically vote for people if they wanted. So you could imagine, for\nexample, a couple million MoveOn members letting a new progressive group\nvote their shares for them, allowing progressives to apply some real\npressure to misbehaving corporations.\n\nCombined with legal changes that are being considered that would further\nmake corporate voting more fair, this is something that could make a\nreal impact.\n\nSeriously Interesting Journalism\n--------------------------------\n\n[I\u2019ve written about this\nbefore.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/deadnews) The basic idea is\nsimple: There\u2019s lots of fascinating stuff going on in the world. And\nyet, to become news, all the background and color is drained out of it.\nWorse, to be on TV, a story has to be so dumbed down that you feel\nstupid for watching it. And to be in the paper, a story has to have so\nlittle background that only an expert could understand it. A news show\nthat covered interesting stories in a way that made them genuinely\ninteresting would be quite popular and could have a tremendous impact.\n\nMore?\n-----\n\nI\u2019ll try to remember to update this page as I learn more. Post your own\nideas in the comments.

It comes early in\nthe film, as Gore talks about the large ice core samples that scientists\ntake to trace the history of the Earth\u2019s temperature and CO2 ratings.\n\nGore shows the results of these samples and then says we can go back\nfurther. The screen expands in both directions to show a massive graph\nof CO2 concentration going back 600,000 years. Its had its fluctuations\nover that time \u2014 large hills and then valleys. Underneath it, he then\ngraphs temperature over the same period.\n\nTemperature tracks CO2 almost exactly, with a several-decade lag. Those\nlarge fluctuations? Those were the six ice ages we\u2019ve had over the past\n600,000 years. CO2 in the atmosphere goes up and so does the\ntemperature, the CO2 trapping the sun\u2019s radiation inside our planet,\nwhere it heats the Earth.\n\nThese huge fluctuations are the difference between ice ages and where we\nare today. Then Gore shows the most recent trajectory of CO2: straight\nup, more than doubled. \u201cIf that much CO2 in one direction causes an ice\nage,\u201d Gore says, \u201cimagine what it will do in the other direction.\u201d And\nthen he shows the projections for the next 50 years.

Wales told us about Wikipedia\u2019s history, technology, and\nculture, but one thing he said stands out. \u201cThe idea that a lot of\npeople have of Wikipedia,\u201d he noted, \u201cis that it\u2019s some emergent\nphenomenon \u2014 the wisdom of mobs, swarm intelligence, that sort of thing\n\u2014 thousands and thousands of individual users each adding a little bit\nof content and out of this emerges a coherent body of\nwork.\u201d[\u2020](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia_fn1) But, he\ninsisted, the truth was rather different: Wikipedia was actually written\nby \u201ca community \u2026 a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\u201d where\n\u201cI know all of them and they all know each other\u201d. Really, \u201cit\u2019s much\nlike any traditional organization.\u201d\n\nThe difference, of course, is crucial. Not just for the public, who\nwants to know how a grand thing like Wikipedia actually gets written,\nbut also for Wales, who wants to know how to run the site. \u201cFor me this\nis really important, because I spend a lot of time listening to those\nfour or five hundred and if \u2026 those people were just a bunch of people\ntalking \u2026 maybe I can just safely ignore them when setting policy\u201d and\ninstead worry about \u201cthe million people writing a sentence each\u201d.\n\nSo did the Gang of 500 actually write Wikipedia? Wales decided to run a\nsimple study to find out: he counted who made the most edits to the\nsite. \u201cI expected to find something like an 80-20 rule: 80% of the work\nbeing done by 20% of the users, just because that seems to come up a\nlot. But it\u2019s actually much, much tighter than that: it turns out over\n50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users \u2026 524 people. \u2026\nAnd in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of\nall the edits.\u201d The remaining 25% of edits, he said, were from \u201cpeople\nwho [are] contributing \u2026 a minor change of a fact or a minor spelling\nfix \u2026 or something like that.\u201d\n\nStanford wasn\u2019t the only place he\u2019s made such a claim; it\u2019s part of the\nstandard talk he gives all over the world. \u201cThis is the group of around\na thousand people who really matter\u201d, he told us at Stanford. \u201cThere is\nthis tight community that is actually doing the bulk of all the\nediting\u201d, he explained at the Oxford Internet Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a group\nof around a thousand to two thousand people,\u201d he informed the crowd at\nGEL 2005. These are just the three talks I watched, but Wales has given\nhundreds more like them.\n\nAt Stanford the students were skeptical. Wales was just counting the\nnumber of edits \u2014 the number of times a user changed something and\nclicked save. Wouldn\u2019t things be different if he counted the amount of\ntext each user contributed? Wales said he planned to do that in \u201cthe\nnext revision\u201d, but was sure \u201cmy results are going to be even stronger\u201d,\nbecause he\u2019d no longer be counting vandalism and other changes that\nlater got removed.\n\nWales presents these claims as comforting. Don\u2019t worry, he tells the\nworld, Wikipedia isn\u2019t as shocking as you think. In fact, it\u2019s just like\nany other project: a small group of colleagues working together toward a\ncommon goal. But if you think about it, Wales\u2019s view of things is\nactually much *more* shocking: around a thousand people wrote the\nworld\u2019s largest encyclopedia in four years for free? Could this really\nbe true?\n\n* * * * *\n\nCurious and skeptical, I decided to investigate. I picked an article at\nrandom (\u201cAlan Alda\u201d) to see how it was written. [Today the Alan Alda\npage](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Alda&oldid=72331810)\nis a pretty standard Wikipedia page: it has a couple photos, several\npages of facts and background, and a handful of links. But [when it was\nfirst\ncreated](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Alda&oldid=234091),\nit was just two sentences: \u201cAlan Alda is a male actor most famous for\nhis role of Hawkeye Pierce in the television series MASH. Or recent\nwork, he plays sensitive male characters in drama movies.\u201d How did it\nget from there to here?\n\nEdit by edit, I watched the page evolve. The changes I saw largely fell\ninto three groups. A tiny handful \u2014 probably around 5 out of nearly 400\n\u2014 were \u201cvandalism\u201d: confused or malicious people adding things that\nsimply didn\u2019t fit, followed by someone undoing their change. The vast\nmajority, by far, were small changes: people fixing typos, formatting,\nlinks, categories, and so on, making the article a little nicer but not\nadding much in the way of substance. Finally, a much smaller amount were\ngenuine additions: a couple sentences or even paragraphs of new\ninformation added to the page.\n\nWales seems to think that the vast majority of users are just doing the\nfirst two (vandalizing or contributing small fixes) while the core group\nof Wikipedians writes the actual bulk of the article. But that\u2019s not at\nall what I found. Almost every time I saw a substantive edit, I found\nthe user who had contributed it was not an active user of the site. They\ngenerally had made less than 50 edits (typically around 10), usually on\nrelated pages. Most never even bothered to create an account.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTo investigate more formally, I purchased some time on a computer\ncluster and downloaded a copy of the Wikipedia archives. I wrote a\nlittle program to go through each edit and count how much of it remained\nin the latest\nversion.[\u2020](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia_fn2) Instead of\ncounting edits, as Wales did, I counted the number of letters a user\nactually contributed to the present article.\n\nIf you just count edits, it appears the biggest contributors to the Alan\nAlda article (7 of the top 10) are registered users who (all but 2) have\nmade thousands of edits to the site. Indeed, \\#4 has made over 7,000\nedits while \\#7 has over 25,000. In other words, if you use Wales\u2019s\nmethods, you get Wales\u2019s results: most of the content seems to be\nwritten by heavy editors.\n\nBut when you count letters, the picture dramatically changes: few of the\ncontributors (2 out of the top 10) are even registered and most (6 out\nof the top 10) have made less than 25 edits to the entire site. In fact,\n\\#9 has made exactly one edit \u2014 this one! With the more reasonable\nmetric \u2014 indeed, the one Wales himself said he planned to use in the\nnext revision of his study \u2014 the result completely reverses.\n\nI don\u2019t have the resources to run this calculation across all of\nWikipedia (there are over 60 million edits!), but I ran it on several\nmore randomly-selected articles and the results were much the same. For\nexample, the largest portion of the Anaconda article was written by a\nuser who only made 2 edits to it (and only 100 on the entire site). By\ncontrast, the largest number of edits were made by a user who appears to\nhave contributed no text to the final article (the edits were all\ndeleting things and moving things around).\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes\none edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits\ntweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of\nedits doing things like changing the name of a category across the\nentire site \u2014 the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a\nresult, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it\u2019s\nthe outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.\n\nAnd when you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Writing an\nencyclopedia is hard. To do anywhere near a decent job, you have to know\na great deal of information about an incredibly wide variety of\nsubjects. Writing so much text is difficult, but doing all the\nbackground research seems impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has a bunch of obscure things that, for one\nreason or another, they\u2019ve come to know well. So they share them,\nclicking the edit link and adding a paragraph or two to Wikipedia. At\nthe same time, a small number of people have become particularly\ninvolved in Wikipedia itself, learning its policies and special syntax,\nand spending their time tweaking the contributions of everybody else.\n\nOther encyclopedias work similarly, just on a much smaller scale: a\nlarge group of people write articles on topics they know well, while a\nsmall staff formats them into a single work. This second group is\nclearly very important \u2014 it\u2019s thanks to them encyclopedias have a\nconsistent look and tone \u2014 but it\u2019s a severe exaggeration to say that\nthey wrote the encyclopedia. One imagines the people running\n*Britannica* worry more about their contributors than their formatters.\n\nAnd Wikipedia should too. Even if all the formatters quit the project\ntomorrow, Wikipedia would still be immensely valuable. For the most\npart, people read Wikipedia because it has the information they need,\nnot because it has a consistent look. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be as nice\nwithout one, but the people who (like me) care about such things would\nprobably step up to take the place of those who had left. The formatters\naid the contributors, not the other way around.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWales is right about one thing, though. This fact does have enormous\npolicy implications. If Wikipedia is written by occasional contributors,\nthen growing it requires making it easier and more rewarding to\ncontribute occasionally. Instead of trying to squeeze more work out of\nthose who spend their life on Wikipedia, we need to broaden the base of\nthose who contribute just a little bit.\n\nUnfortunately, precisely because such people are only occasional\ncontributors, their opinions aren\u2019t heard by the current Wikipedia\nprocess. They don\u2019t get involved in policy debates, they don\u2019t go to\nmeetups, and they don\u2019t hang out with Jimbo Wales. And so things that\nmight help them get pushed on the backburner, assuming they\u2019re even\nproposed.\n\nOut of sight is out of mind, so it\u2019s a short hop to thinking these\ninvisible people aren\u2019t particularly important. Thus Wales\u2019s belief that\n500 people wrote half an encyclopedia. Thus his assumption that\noutsiders contribute mostly vandalism and nonsense. And thus the\ncomments you sometimes hear that making it hard to edit the site might\nbe a good thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a wiki person who happened to go into encyclopedias,\u201d Wales\ntold the crowd at Oxford. \u201cI\u2019m an encyclopedia person who happened to\nuse a wiki.\u201d So perhaps his belief that Wikipedia was written in the\ntraditional way isn\u2019t surprising. Unfortunately, it is dangerous. If\nWikipedia continues down this path of focusing on the encyclopedia at\nthe expense of the wiki, it might end up not being much of either.\n\n**More:** [Further\nreading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election/FAQ) | [Vote\nfor me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election) | [Discuss\non\nMeta-Wiki](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Who_Writes_Wikipedia%3F)\n| [Discuss on\nReddit](http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)\n\n**Follow ups:** [Summary of further\nresearch](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/writefp), [summary of\nresponses](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowritescomments).\n\n**Additional information:** [my collection of research on this\nquestion](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/whowriteswikipedia/).\n", "external_links": ["http://www.hyuki.com/yukiwiki/wiki.cgi?WhoWritesWikipedia", "http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:Chewie/Qui%C3%A9n_escribe_la_Wikipedia", "http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Avatar/Wer_schreibt_die_Wikipedia", "http://ulik.typepad.com/leafar/2006/09/qui_ecrit_wikip.html", "mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election", "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Alda&oldid=72331810", "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Alda&oldid=234091", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election/FAQ", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election", "http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Who_Writes_Wikipedia%3F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia"], "time": 1157353200.0, "postid": "whowriteswikipedia", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia_fn1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia_fn2", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/writefp", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowritescomments", "http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/whowriteswikipedia/"]}, "colombiaisbleeding": {"post_title": "Colombia is Bleeding", "tags": [], "post_content": "Colombia is Bleeding\n====================\n\nJanuary 4, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/colombiaisbleeding)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Nellie McKay is having trouble getting her new album,* Pretty Little\nHead, *released, apparently due to the content of artistic differences\nwith the record label.

When I wanted to turn left, I\u2019d rotate my arms\nleft and we\u2019d all move left. I didn\u2019t think of it as having the bike\nmove left and staying on the bike \u2014 I thought of it as moving left. The\nbike was a part of me.\n\nIt\u2019s the same way I think of a car. You buckle into your seatbelt and\nsuddenly you grow to become this huge hunk of metal that tears down the\nroad.

Similarly, when I want my bike to turn left I\nsimply rotate the handle and let it use its momentum to wheel me over.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. I recently bought a nice, new, blue bike.

It\u2019s kind of a weird experience: it makes sense\nto be afraid of people and other things that can hurt you, but being\nafraid of a *personality*? It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.

I remember once I found myself\nat Caltrain\u2019s Milbrae station late at night. Milbrae is a huge new\nstation, a sprawling complex complete with a subway, 10 bus stops, a\ntrain, and a huge parking garage. There\u2019s nothing really around it for\nquite a bit and it\u2019s all open-air, with the cold night air chilling me\nin my shirt, as I was transferring between the subway and the train. On\nthe way to the train tracks, I checked the schedule. The next train was\nat 10:47 it said; it was 10:40, so I hurried downstairs to wait for the\ntrain. I sat down and got out my book, waiting, and waiting, while the\ntrain never came. I checked the clock \u2014 it was past 10:47, well past. So\nI checked the downstairs schedule. There was no 10:47 train. I ran\nupstairs to see if the schedule I\u2019d read was simply out-of-date. It had\nno 10:47 train either, nothing even close. I was certain I had read it\nsaying 10:47 \u2014 the memory was clear in my mind, and I\u2019d followed the\nline with my finger to make sure I had the right station.\n\nI suddenly got quite scared. What was going on? Was I in a dream? Was\nsomeone sneaking around the schedules on me? Was I the victim of some\npractical joke? The fabric of my reality was being torn \u2014 something\nclearly impossible had happened: a time had disappeared off a train\nschedule. Things weren\u2019t working the way I expected.\n\nI later figured out, of course, that nothing so devious had happened. In\nmy hurry to catch the subway, I\u2019d read the wrong side of the schedule \u2014\nthe train was at 10:47am, not 10:47pm, and when I went back to look for\nthe time I looked at the right side of the schedule and, naturally, the\ntrain wasn\u2019t there. But my larger point is that tears in the way we\nthink things work are scary. If things are this bad when a piece of\npaper doesn\u2019t say what we expect, it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s worse\nwhen people we know don\u2019t behave the way we thought.\n\nI say we here, but as I mentioned at the start, I seem to be a bit alone\non this. One possibility is that I\u2019m hypersensitive to such emotions.\nOther people might simply feel a prick at such a scheduling anomaly, but\nI feel it as full-blown fear. Another (more flattering) possibility is\nthat I\u2019m more perceptive about people than others; since others don\u2019t\nnotice the duplicity, they don\u2019t feel the associated fear.\n\nThe latter makes some sense to me, as the things that make me scared of\npeople are often very subtle, and others don\u2019t seem to recognize them at\nall, even when I ask them about it specifically. Even I can\u2019t quite put\nmy finger on what it is sometime, it\u2019s just a subtle signal that the\nperson isn\u2019t being straight with you, that what they\u2019re saying sounds\nhonest and friendly, but is actually manipulative. It\u2019s not a pleasant\nfeeling.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  In talking about this sequence of emotions (shocked, upset, scared),\n    I\u2019m referring to a logical progression, not an actual one.

And now I was getting to stay there \u2014 apparently we might\neven be able to stay there for the whole summer.\n\nSo I signed up for a few nights \u2014 got an amazingly low room rate \u2014 and\nbought a plane ticket for tomorrow morning \u2014 also surprisingly cheap and\nperfect (I thought I\u2019d have to leave out of some obscure airport and\nstop in some obscure hub, but it\u2019s direct from SF!).

A few cars drove\ndown the street, a few guys loitered outside the bars, a few lights were\non in windows, but the city was quietly shutting down. I walked down the\nsteps into the subway, paid my fare, and began looking for a place to\nsit and read.\n\nI found a bench, another kid sitting at the opposite side, and took my\nseat. \u201cSpare a dollar?\u201d the kid asked. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, \u201cspent\neverything I have to get in here.\u201d \u201cMan, wish I had five bucks,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIf I had that I\u2019d be out there grabbing a meal. I haven\u2019t eaten\nin like two days.\u201d\n\nI tried to read my book but he wanted to talk. \u201cYou just come back from\nschool?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI was visiting a friend.\u201d \u201cOh, I\nthought you were at school \u2018cause of the book.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been carrying\nthis around all day,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a book about\nbooks,\u201d I said. He laughed. \u201cI thought it was a bible or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heading to Alewife?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m staying\nright here.\u201d I blinked twice and began to realize what he meant. He\nwasn\u2019t asking for money because he\u2019d been out all night and spent the\ncash his parents gave him. He was asking for money because he was\nhomeless. And with fits and starts, he told me a little of his story as\nI waited for the train.\n\nHe grew up with his family in New Hampshire. They were \u201crich\u201d then, at\nleast by comparison, lived in a real \u201cmansion\u201d. Inspectors started\ncoming around to check out the house, three in one month. Finally a man\ncame to tell them the bad news. \u201cYou have to move out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nhouse is infested with termites; it\u2019ll collapse within months.\u201d \u201cWhat\nare you talking about?\u201d his mom responded. \u201cThis place is fine;\ninspectors have been looking it all over.\u201d The man picked up a large\nhammer, lifted it above his head and struck a mighty blow \u2014 at the wall.\nThe drywall broke away to reveal termites filling the insides, eating\naway at the wood.\n\nThey had to leave fast, didn\u2019t even have time to pack stuff. The\nbulldozers came the next day, turned the whole thing into rubble. They\nalso bulldozed his mom\u2019s car, where she kept all the money. They were\nhomeless and penniless. The Department of Social Services picked up his\nfive-year-old brother, insisted on \\$100 fee if they wanted to regain\ncustody. \u201cIf I had that kind of money,\u201d he explained, \u201cI\u2019d be eating\nwith it.\u201d\n\nSo he decided to start hitchhiking, head to Cambridge where he had some\nfamily. Caught a ride in the back of a UPS truck, then after that\ndropped him off, waited for another hour or two in the middle of nowhere\nbefore he could find someone else. Finally he found his way to part of\nthe Boston subway system, where he managed to sneak his way through the\nturnstiles. Now he could ride all around town, get to Cambridge, where\nhe set up base in Central Square.\n\n\u201cMostly I just sit here,\u201d he explained. \u201cSometimes I just ride the\ntrains all day, Braintree to Alewife and back. Found a violin some guy\nhad lost \u2014 hey, I\u2019m homeless and you\u2019re not \u2014 and started playing it for\nmoney, but the cops picked me up for performing without a license and\nthrew me in jail for the night. Just because I\u2019m a homeless kid you\u2019re\ngoing to throw me in jail? Anyway, I make more money than that just\ntelling jokes.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty absurd, actually. Spent all day here asking folks for spare\nchange, nobody could spare a thing. Here I am, homeless kid in\nCambridge, and nobody even has a couple spare pennies!\u201d\n\nTo outward appearances he seems like a normal kid with a bit of an army\nlook. His hair is buzzed, he wears a wifebeater shirt with an army\njacket and baggy army pants. At first I thought this was just a style,\nbut actually it\u2019s utilitarian \u2014 everything he owns is in the pockets of\nthose pants. He showed me what he had.\n\n\u201cStole this from a friend today,\u201d he said, pulling something out from\nunder his jacket. \u201cBrand new CD player, awesome headphones, full\nbatteries, great CD inside.\u201d He began playing it for me; it was rap\nsongs: Ridin\u2019 and Eminem. \u201cAnd check out this he said,\u201d before pulling\nout a PSP. \u201cGot this when we were rich, but can\u2019t use it for much now;\nhad to sell all our games so we could try to find a house.\u201d He popped it\nopen. \u201cSee, no cartridges. Still, I borrow some from friends sometimes.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, as Eminem came out of his headphones, which he\u2019d\ncranked all the way up so I could listen. \u201cMan, imagine if Eminem were\nright here now, all those girls shaking their asses by him. Wouldn\u2019t\nthat be crazy?\u201d \u201cCrazier things have happened,\u201d I said. \u201cLots of famous\npeople go to Harvard Square.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cBeyonce was there the\nother week \u2014 came in for a wedding or something \u2014 it was like a mob\nscene, people jumping all over her.\u201d\n\nHe often took the conversation in the direction of such imaginations \u2014\nwhat if a celebrity popped up here? He talked about how he used to play\n*Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* with a cheat code to make celebrities\nappear in the game. But aside from these discursions, he was remarkably\ncogent, pretty sane for someone in such a screwed-up situation.\n\n\u201cMan, my life sucks,\u201d he said after a pause. \u201cIf you could do anything,\nwhat would you do?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf I could do anything?\u201d he said. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cMan, I\u2019d be back at home with my mom and brothers and family and\nstuff.\u201d\n\nHe begun telling me something about his mom \u2014 how she\u2019d managed to\nrecover one of her debit cards from the rubble of her car and bought a\nnew house, but never told him about it, he\u2019d only heard rumor of it\nthird-hand, how she\u2019d put her own child out on the street to fend for\nhimself, but I couldn\u2019t quite hear him because the train pulled up as he\nwas talking. He finally stopped talking, but I strained, waiting for\nmore. \u201cThat\u2019s your train,\u201d he finally said, \u201cyou better catch it.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, walking towards it.\n\nI grabbed a seat, hearing \u201cSpare change? Spare change?\u201d as the doors\nclosed and we pulled away.

As someone who kind of misses\npiece-work, it made me want to think through the issues involved.\n\nBecause, in the real world, competition is imperfect, when a company\nsells something it earns a surplus. That surplus then must be divided\nbetween capital and labor, or more concretely, the company and the\nemployee. The terms of distribution are determined by the employment\nagreement (i.e. how much the employee will get paid).\n\nIf labor has all the power, it will want almost all of the surplus, so\nit\u2019d demand an employee agreement where it gets paid a big chunk per\ngood produced \u2014 this is basically piece-work. If capital has all the\npower, it will want to pay employees barely enough to stay alive and be\nable to show up for work \u2014 this is basically wages. So, to a first\napproximation, wages are what you get when capital is in charge and\npiece-work is what you get when labor is in charge.\n\nBut there are some additional considerations. The transaction costs for\ncapital are relatively low \u2014 you can invest in a whole bunch of\ncompanies at a time, whereas you can really only do a couple jobs at a\ntime (or usually just one) and it\u2019s quite painful to find another one.\nSo employees also want insurance \u2014 they want to guarantee they\u2019ll keep\ngetting paid even when the market for the stuff they produce declines.\nAgain, we can imagine two extremes: if labor is in charge, it\u2019ll want a\njob for life, where getting downsized is inconceivable; if capital is in\ncharge, it\u2019ll want to employ people for exactly as long as their\nmarginal product is profitable \u2014 which means staffing up in booms and\ndownsizing freely in busts (and not just business cycle booms and busts\n\u2014 companies want to hire lots of temporary workers for Christmas, for\nexample).\n\nNow obviously a job for life doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense in a piece-work\nworld. If AT&T has guaranteed you a job for life with steady wages, then\nit makes sense for it to invest in retraining you for some different\npart of the business when mechanical telephone switches get replaced by\ncomputer servers. It\u2019s less clear how this would work in a piece-work\ndeal. But the fact is there\u2019s no reason the insurance part should be\ntied to the wages. In Denmark, for example, if your job disappears the\ngovernment simply pays you 90% of your old salary until you find a new\none (up to some cap, of course). There\u2019s no reason piece-work can\u2019t\ncoexist with this kind of social insurance system, which would seem to\nbe the choice of our all-powerful labor.\n\nBut that\u2019s treating labor as a monolithic entity. The third thing wages\ndo is collapse differences in pay *between* workers. For example, it\u2019s\nwell established that programmer productivity varies by an order of\nmagnitude \u2014 the best programmers at a company can be *ten times* as\nproductive as the worst programmers \u2014 but I\u2019ve never heard of a company\nwhere programmer pay varies by anywhere near that much. Really great\nprogrammers might be paid double or perhaps even triple the worst\nprogrammers, but I\u2019ve never heard of anything close to a 10x difference.\n\nThe one place where you do see these really huge differences is in CEO\npay, but even this isn\u2019t really a counterexample since CEO is a job with\nno intra-company reference class. That is, it\u2019s not like companies will\nhave one CEO getting paid \\$1.2M and a another getting paid \\$12M\n(indeed, I\u2019d guess companies with co-CEOs find them getting paid the\nsame amount) \u2014 instead, the order-of-magnitude differences are all found\nacross companies.\n\nBut order-of-magnitude differences are totally possible with piece-work,\nespecially the kind of intellectual piece-work that Zittrain is\nconcerned with. Krugman has bragged that he \u201cwrites faster than anyone\nin journalism\u201d and it\u2019s quite possible to imagine him turning out\ncolumns in a tenth the time of Barbara Ehrenreich (who turned down the\nNYT op-ed columnist job because it was too time-consuming). So wages\nmight be a way of quietly redistributing money from the speedy Krugmans\nto the dawdling Ehrenreichs. But just as with social insurance, you can\nimagine this role being taken up by the government instead: through\nprogressive taxation.\n\nNow according to classic economic theory, these changes wouldn\u2019t just be\ndetails of style, but would increase the size of the overall pie. And,\non the squishy side, they\u2019d provide much greater scope for human\nfreedom. Assuming I was guaranteed a decent wage either way, I\u2019d far\nrather be able to stay up late working one night in exchange for blowing\noff work the next. Not to mention getting to work the hours I want, from\nthe place I want, in the way I want, etc.\n\nNow the practical fact is that most jobs don\u2019t have a concrete enough\nproduct to be amenable to piece-work. They\u2019re a mixture of all sorts of\ndifferent tasks, require interaction with a specific group of other\npeople, and have all sorts of other features that kind of force them to\nbe your usual office job. But none of that applies to Zittrain \u2014 he\u2019s\ntalking about jobs that are *already* piece-work and arguing that they\nshouldn\u2019t be. But it seems to me like, if you\u2019re on the side of labor,\nyour preferred solution should be more social insurance and progressive\ntaxation instead.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1341471600.0, "postid": "piecework", "internal_links": []}, "birthdaythoughts": {"post_title": "Birthday Thoughts", "tags": [], "post_content": "Birthday Thoughts\n=================\n\nNovember 8, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/birthdaythoughts)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s my birthday today, although it doesn\u2019t feel like it.

In what sense is the number of elected officials broader\nthan the influences that come to bear on them?\n\nMatt seems to be arguing that countries with fewer elected officials are\nbetter run because voters can monitor the performance of those officials\nbetter. I don\u2019t see how this argument can possibly survive engagement\nwith the details of our political system.\n\nLet\u2019s take health care, since that\u2019s in the news lately. Health care has\nbasically been talked about nonstop by every news outlet, yet even\nvoters who follow these things in detail have no clue what\u2019s really in\nit. (This is true even of my friends who are political junkies; they\nknow a public option isn\u2019t in the bill, but they basically have no idea\nwhat the exchanges are or how they would work.) When election season\nrolls around, campaigns will begin running lots of ads about the health\ncare bill. None of these ads will help inform them what\u2019s in it. And the\npress will continue not to inform them about what\u2019s in it.\n\nI don\u2019t see how having fewer elected officials will change any of this.\nThe problem is not that voters try to monitor their elected officials\nbut are simply overwhelmed; the problem is that voters have no tools for\nactually monitoring their elected officials in any meaningful sense.\nYes, one can point to a [Chris Hayes\nflowchart](http://www.donkeylicious.com/2009/09/improved-health-insurance-reform.html)\nhere or [an Alec MacGillis\nguide](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/14/AR2009081401669.html)\nthere, but there\u2019s no way any significant number of voters know how to\nfind those things. And even if you tell them about those, there\u2019s no\nsystem for finding similar documents about issues in the future.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the biggest issue Congress is considering this session! And\nthat\u2019s just its broadest outlines! The health care bill has thousands of\npages of detailed provisions and it\u2019s just one of thousands of bills\nCongress is trying to pass. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s even reading all of\nthose provisions, let alone trying to figure out which ones are good\nideas and which representatives are fighting for the good ideas.\n\nInstead, there\u2019s a vast industry of lobbyists, each of which care really\ndeeply about a handful of those tiny issues and are willing to spend\nvast amounts of money and effort persuading members of Congress to take\ntheir side. On most issues, they face no opposition. So naturally, the\nmembers take their side.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is not fewer representatives, but better monitoring\nsystems and institutional incentives to make monitoring less necessary.\nBetter monitoring systems is what I\u2019m working on and better\ninstitutional incentives is what Lessig is fighting for. If Matt thinks\nthat fewer representatives is a better or \u201cbroader\u201d solution, I\u2019d like\nto hear him explain how it\u2019s going to help.\n\n*Disclosure: I\u2019m on the board of Lessig\u2019s group, Change Congress.*\n", "external_links": ["http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/01/for-less-voting.php", "http://boldprogressives.org/", "http://www.donkeylicious.com/2009/09/improved-health-insurance-reform.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/14/AR2009081401669.html"], "time": 1264838400.0, "postid": "fewerreps", "internal_links": []}, "kwaze-kwasa": {"post_title": "Is the DMCA a scam?", "tags": [], "post_content": "Is the DMCA a scam?\n===================\n\nNovember 14, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kwaze-kwasa)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI received my first DMCA takedown notice today.

The answer, we quickly learn, is that it\ndestroys the people behind them. Without anything to fight, Bruce Wayne\nis just a reclusive withered husk, while Commissioner Gordon is actually\ngoing to be fired. Given that these are two of the film\u2019s most\nsympathetic characters, we naturally tend to deplore this situation. And\nso the film\u2019s first key point: the champions of law-and-order do not\ntruly want to succeed at their stated mission.\n\nIn a world without (street) crime, the police become merely the\nerrand-boys for the wealthy, not bothering to refocus their efforts on\ncorporate or economic criminals (like Daggett). Gordon sighs at having\nsuch quotidian assignments as tracking down wayward members of Congress;\nmeanwhile no one even considers punishing the same Congressman for\nsexually harassing Selina Kyle. As a result, economic inequality grows\nunchecked and Gotham\u2019s citizens are saved from physical attack only to\nsuffer economic depredation (some literally moving into the sewers in\nthe desperate search for a job).\n\nThe whole thing is the mirror of the beginning of the first film, in\nwhich Wayne\u2019s Keynesian Supertrain project to boost the city\u2019s economy\nis felled by random street crime. Now the ending of street crime is\nultimately felled by the failure to create an economy that works for\nall. ([Ra\u2019s al\nGhul](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/quotes?qt0469932): \u201cOver the\nages, our weapons have grown more sophisticated. With Gotham, we tried a\nnew one: Economics. \u2026 Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a\ncriminal.\u201d)\n\nWith the state having withered away to little more than a nightwatchman\nfor the wealthy, private charity is all that\u2019s left to fill the widening\ngap between the horribly poor and the terribly wealthy. But this is\nultimately a failure, because most of the wealthy philanthropists are\nmore concerned with their own self-image than actual impact. Worse,\nthose who are making a difference are forced to cancel their charitable\nprograms when the downturn (and questionable business decisions) cause\ntheir profits to slump.\n\nInto this Rawlsian nightmare walks Bane, a thug who escaped Middle\nEastern extraordinary rendition to train with Arab terrorists before\nheading to Gotham. There he\u2019s building an underground vanguard party,\nconstructing a new society literally underneath the decadent old one.\n\nBane\u2019s activists crash the Gotham Stock Exchange (which is exactly like\nthe NYSE except with a gaudy ticker on the door), using their\nproletarian roles (bike messenger, shoe shiner, cement mixer) to seize\ncontrol of the markets and expropriate the wealth of Bruce Wayne, the\ncity\u2019s richest man. Having a real enemy revitalizes Wayne, leading him\nto return to action as Batman and attempt to catch the criminals.\n\nBut with the Gordon Era on its way out, the police are more concerned\nwith stopping the vigilante Batman than the expropriators, letting them\nget away. Thus just as Batman\u2019s success in stopping crime made himself\nunnecessary, his clumsy failure is what allows him to return.\n\nThe activists strike a tactical alliance with certain deluded members of\nthe capitalist class, using their expropriation to engineer a hostile\ntakeover of Wayne Enterprises, eventually allowing them (with a small\namount of violence) to take possession of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThat way, when the vanguardists use proletarian sabotage to secede and\ndeclare independence, the US can\u2019t intervene and instead leaves the\nnewly-independent city to its own devices.^[2](#fn:fp)^ (Once again,\nWayne has made it possible for his enemies to succeed \u2014 they never could\nhave done it without his nuke.) Bane quickly dismantles the repressive\nstate, releasing the prisoners locked up without parole under the harsh\nlaw-and-order regime. In the resulting anarchy, the people quickly do\nwhat the old establishment wouldn\u2019t: string up the bankers (sometimes\nliterally) and redistribute their wealth. (Their show-trials are the\nmirror to the establishment\u2019s treatment of organized crime under the\nDent Act, harshly punishing the criminals and seizing their assets with\nlimited due process.)\n\nEmphasizing that all power ultimately comes from the force of the fist,\nthe police try to reassert their control in a climactic street brawl\nagainst Bane\u2019s vanguardists. However, the situation only gets worse for\nthem as it\u2019s revealed that Talia, the daughter of the Arab terrorist\nleader, has arranged the nuke to detonate unavoidably.\n\nBatman apparently finally realizes that he\u2019s only creating the crime he\ntries so hard to stop ([as The Joker told\nhim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPuToZT0vfY), \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill\nyou! What would I do without you?\u2026you complete me\u201d), so he fakes his own\ndeath as he disposes of the bomb. He ends the film in Italy, apparently\nleading a normal life with an attractive reformed\ncatburglar.^[3](#fn:fn1)^\n\nAs Neil Kandalgaonkar [notes in\ncomments](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr#c1):\n\n> If Bruce Wayne had never used his resources to \u2018improve\u2019 matters,\n> Gotham would be a thriving (albeit often corrupt) city.

There are the surface ones, of course \u2014 sociology\ntypically studies first-world societies, whereas anthropology has a rep\nfor studying so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d cultures. But the fundamental\ndifference is a philosophical one: sociologists study society, while\nanthropologists study culture.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Let\u2019s do a case study. It\u2019s easy to notice a\nsubtle sort of sexism in American textbooks. For example, studies have\nfound that in biology textbooks sperm are seen as competitive creatures\nwhile eggs are passive receptacles they aim to penetrate. But the actual\nscience on the subject is much less clear: eggs seem to do a fair bit of\nselection themselves, etc.\n\nI saw a paper by an anthropologist on this fact; their argument was that\nthese textbooks were a result of the sexism of American culture, a\nculture which sees men as competing for access to women, and those\nnotions are naturally transported onto our writing about conception.\nSexist culture, sexist output.\n\nA sociologist would dig a little deeper. They\u2019d see who writes the\ntextbooks, perhaps notice a disproportionate number of males. They\u2019d\nlook into why it was that males got these jobs, find the sexism inherent\nin the relevant institutions. They\u2019d argue it was the structures of\nsociety that end up with sexist textbooks, not some magical force known\nas \u201cAmerican culture\u201d.\n\nAs you might guess, I\u2019m on the side of the sociologists. Blaming things\non culture \u2014 as if it were a natural property of a group of people or a\nmystical life force with its own mind \u2014 seems too facile. It also seems\nwrong.\n\nI\u2019ve mostly been talking about the cultural anthropologists, but there\nare also a subset of racist anthropologists (sometimes called\n\u201canthropological science,\u201d in accordance with [Wall\u2019s\nLaw](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/psuedoscientism)). These\nanthropologists tried to measure different properties of people, see if\nthey could quantify the differences between the races and predict\ncriminality from the shape of the head.\n\nCultural anthropologists disdain all that and prefer to endorse a very\nleft-wing notion of cultural relativism. (One shouldn\u2019t make judgments\nabout other cultures!) But in doing so, they end up pushing the\njudgments off onto the peoples involved. Just like the racist\nanthropologists, they end up suggesting that the reason people over here\nbelieve act differently from the people over there is because they\u2019re\ndifferent people.\n\nBut if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from psychology, it\u2019s that \u2014 for\nthe most part \u2014 people are people, wherever you go. As Zimbardo\u2019s\nStanford Prison Experiment showed, put normal people into the wrong\nsituation and they turn into devious enforcement machines. And put the\nsame people into a different society and they\u2019ll change just as fast.\n\nIt isn\u2019t culture \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 that causes these things; it\u2019s\ninstitutions. Institutions create environments which force a course of\naction. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m a sociologist.\n\n*Bonus recommendation:* I\u2019ve been watching *The Wire* lately; perhaps\nthe most sociologically-inclined show on television.

One of the best movies I\u2019ve seen. Spoilers\nfollow.\n\nOK, let\u2019s start by explaining how a looper\u2019s career is supposed to look.\nYou get hired as a looper, spend your time sitting in a corn field\nshooting people, eventually shoot yourself and get a big payday, live\noff of it for thirty more years, then get kidnapped and sent back in\ntime and shot by yourself. Notice that this is a stable timeloop: young\nyou grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old,\ngoes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old \u2026 etc.\n\nBut time travel doesn\u2019t eliminate free will. We see this with the case\nof Seth (Paul Dano / Frank Brennan). Instead of shooting Old Seth, Young\nSeth decides to let him escape. This too is a stable timeloop: young\nSeth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while young\nSeth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while \u2026 .\n\nBut other characters have free will too: young Joe (Joseph\nGordon-Levitt) decides to give young Seth up. The gang cuts off one of\nyoung Seth\u2019s fingers, pushing him into a new timeloop: young Seth gets\ncaught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, while\nyoung Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time,\nescapes, etc. With each new choice by the gang to let old Seth change\nyoung Seth\u2019s future (and thus old Seth\u2019s past), we head into a new\ntimeloop, where old Seth has a different past (and thus different\nmemories and different missing limbs).\n\nIn the first main timeloop (shown second in the movie, via a flashback),\nyoung Joe shoots old Joe, goes to China, becomes an unusually-talented\nagent of violence, finds true love, is kidnapped and sent back in time,\nand gets killed by young Joe, who goes on to do the same thing. This too\nis a nice stable timeloop.\n\nBut on one of these runs through the loop, old Joe manages to overpower\nthe guards and, while he does go back in time, he manages to keep young\nJoe from killing him. He escapes into the field, finds the location of\nyoung Cid, then comes back to shoot Cid\u2019s mother while Cid escapes into\nfield and stows away on a train. Cid grows up to be the Rainmaker and\nJoe grows old. Cid\u2019s henchmen murder old Joe\u2019s wife but are overpowered\nby old Joe, who goes back in time to try again to kill Cid, who again\nescapes to become the Rainmaker and kill Joe\u2019s wife. This too is a\nstable timeloop, although we see some of it only in speculative\nflash-forwards (I\u2019ll explain why in a moment).\n\nWhich timeloop are we watching? Well, we\u2019re watching the story of a\nparticular instance of Joe, who we\u2019ll call Movie Joe. Movie Joe only\nexists, however, because of a choice made by Flashback Joe (the Joe we\nsee in the flashback that begins when Movie Joe is falling from his\napartment). Flashback Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth,\ncloses his own loop, grows old, overpowers the henchmen, goes back in\ntime, knocks out Movie Joe, hunts down Cid, and is about to kill Cid\u2019s\nmother.\n\nBut Flashback Joe is not the protagonist of the film. The protagonist is\nMovie Joe. Movie Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, fails\nto close his loop, goes to protect Cid. Normally, young Joe fails and\nheads into a timeloop where Cid stows away on the train and becomes the\nRainmaker. But Movie Joe somehow is able to foresee this future and\nconcludes the only way to prevent it is to kill himself. Since he dies\nthere, he never grows old and never goes back in time, leading to a\ntimeline where Flashback Joe doesn\u2019t ever exist. Note, this is not a\nstable timeloop (because Movie Joe only kills himself to stop Flashback\nJoe, who can\u2019t exist if Movie Joe kills himself) but instead just a\ngarden-variety timeline. In this timeline, presumably, Sarah keeps Cid\nfrom growing evil and everything ends happily ever after.\n\nNext week we\u2019ll explain *Primer*.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1349679600.0, "postid": "looperexplained", "internal_links": []}, "semmelweis": {"post_title": "Look at yourself objectively", "tags": [], "post_content": "Look at yourself objectively\n============================\n\nAugust 18, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*This post is part three of the series [Raw\nNerve](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).*\n\nIn the 1840s, hospitals were dangerous places. Mothers who went in to\ngive birth often didn\u2019t make it out. For example, at Vienna General\nHospital\u2019s First Obstetrical Clinic, as many as 10% of mothers died of\npuerperal fever after giving birth. But there was some good news: at the\nSecond Clinic, the number was just 4%. Expectant mothers noticed this \u2014\nsome would get down on their knees and beg to be admitted to the Second\nClinic. Others, hearing new patients were being admitted to the First\nClinic that day, decided they\u2019d rather give birth in the streets.\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis, an assistant at the First Clinic, couldn\u2019t bear it. He\nbegan desperately searching for some kind of explanation for the\ndifference. He tested many things without success. Then, in 1847,\nSemmelweis\u2019s friend Jakob Kolletschka was performing an autopsy when a\nstudent accidentally poked him with a scalpel. It was a minor injury,\nbut Kolletschka got terribly sick and ultimately passed away, with\nsymptoms rather like the what the mothers had. Which got Semmelweis\nwondering: was some \u201cdeathly material\u201d on the corpses responsible for\nthe deaths?\n\nTo test this, he insisted the doctors begin washing their hands with\nchlorinated lime (which he found best removed the stink of death) before\nhandling the pregnant women. The results were shocking. In April 1847,\nthe mortality rate was 18.3%. Semmelweis instituted handwashing in\nmid-May and by June the mortality rate had crashed to 2.2%. The next\nmonth it was even less and later that year it reached zero \u2014 for the\nfirst time ever.\n\nYou\u2019d think doctors would be thrilled by this incredible discovery.\nInstead, Semmelweis was ridiculed and attacked. He was fired from the\nhospital and forced out of Vienna. \u201cIn published medical works my\nteachings are either ignored or attacked,\u201d he complained. \u201cThe medical\nfaculty at W\u00fcrzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in\nwhich my teachings were rejected.\u201d Even in his native Vienna, hundreds\nof mothers continued to die every year.\n\nSemmelweis turned to alcohol and his behavior became increasingly\nerratic. In 1865, he was committed to a mental institution. There he was\nbeaten by the guards, placed in a straitjacket, and locked in a dark\ncell. He died shortly thereafter, at the age of 47, from an infected\nwound.^[1](#fn:fn1)^\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhy did doctors so stubbornly reject Ignaz Semmelweis? Well, imagine\nbeing told *you* were responsible for the deaths of thousands of your\npatients. That you had been killing the people you were supposed to be\nprotecting. That you were so bad at your job that you were actually\nworse than just giving birth in the street.\n\nWe all know people don\u2019t like to hear bad news about themselves. Indeed,\nwe go out of our way to avoid it \u2014 and when we do confront it, we try to\ndownplay it or explain it away. Cognitive dissonance psychologists have\nproven it in dozens of experiments: Force students through an\nembarrassing initiation to take a class, and they\u2019ll insist the class is\nmuch more interesting. Make them do a favor for someone they hate, and\nthey start insisting they actually like them. Have them make a small\nethical compromises and they\u2019ll feel comfortable making bigger and\nbigger ones. Instead of just accepting we made a mistake, and shouldn\u2019t\nhave compromised or done the favor or join the class, we start telling\nourselves that compromising isn\u2019t so bad \u2014 and when the next compromise\ncomes along, we believe the lies we tell ourselves, and leap at making\nanother mistake. We hate hearing bad news about ourselves so much that\nwe\u2019d rather *change our behavior* than just admit we screwed\nup.^[2](#fn:mwm)^\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help much when our friends point out what we did wrong. If\nwe\u2019re so scared of hearing from ourselves that we made a mistake, just\nimagine how much we hate hearing it from someone else. And our friends\nknow this: the answer to \u201cDoes this outfit make me look fat?\u201d is not\nsupposed to be \u201cyes.\u201d We may joke about our friends\u2019 foibles behind\ntheir back, but we rarely do so to their face. Even at work, a lot of\neffort goes into making sure employees are insulated from their\nsuperior\u2019s most negative assessments. This is what we\u2019re taught: make\nfive compliments for every criticism, sandwich negative feedback with\npositive feedback on each side, the most important thing is to keep up\nsomeone\u2019s self-esteem.\n\nBut, as Semmelweis showed, this is a dangerous habit. Sure, it\u2019s awful\nto hear you\u2019re killing people\u2014but it\u2019s way worse to *keep on killing\npeople*! It may not be fun to get told you\u2019re lazy, but it\u2019s better to\nhear it now than to find out when you\u2019re fired. If you want to work on\ngetting better, you need to start by knowing where you are.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSemmelweis was defeated about as much as a man can be defeated. But\nnothing the other doctors could do to him would change the facts.\nEventually scientists proved the germ theory of disease and Semmelweis\nwas vindicated. Today, he\u2019s an international hero: universities and\nhospitals are named after him, his house has been turned into a museum,\nAustria even put his face on a \u20ac50 gold coin. Meanwhile, the doctors who\nopposed him are now seen as close-minded killers.\n\nTry as you might, you can\u2019t beat reality. Semmelweis was right: those\ndoctors *were* killing people. Firing him, driving him out of the\ncountry, writing long books disproving all his claims \u2014 none of it could\nchange that frightening fact. The doctors may have thought they were\nwinning the argument at the time, but they were big losers in the long\nrun. And so were all the families that lost a loved one because they\nrefused to admit their mistake.\n\nBut imagine if they had. When you\u2019re being attacked, conceding you\nscrewed up seems like the worst thing you can do. If even you won\u2019t\nstand up for yourself, how can anyone else believe in you? Admitting\nyour mistakes seems like giving up; it just proves that your opponents\nwere right all along. But is it really so bad?\n\nWhen Oprah started defending fabulist James Frey, she was savaged by the\npress. So she invited her critics on the show and apologized, saying\n\u201cYou were right, I was wrong.\u201d It didn\u2019t destroy her reputation; it\nrescued it. When the space shuttle *Columbia* exploded, launch manager\nWayne Hale took full responsibility: \u201cThe bottom line is that I failed\nto understand what I was being told\u2026I am guilty of allowing Columbia to\ncrash.\u201d He was promoted. When JFK admitted the responsibility for the\nBay of Pigs fiasco was \u201cmine, and mine alone,\u201d his poll numbers\nsoared.^[3](#fn:mwm2)^\n\nImagine the same thing in your own life. If your boss started taking\nresponsibility for your organization\u2019s problems instead of blaming\nothers, wouldn\u2019t you like him more? If your doctor told you honestly\nthat she had screwed up a procedure, instead of trying to cover up the\nmistake, wouldn\u2019t you prefer that? If a politician came clean that their\npolicy proposals had failed, wouldn\u2019t you be more likely to trust him?\n\nIn moments of great emotional stress, we revert to our worst habits: we\ndig in and fight harder. The real trick is not to get better at fighting\n\u2014 it\u2019s to get better at stopping ourselves: at taking a deep breath,\ncalming down, and letting our better natures take over from our worst\ninstincts.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEven if seeing ourselves objectively is the best option, all our natural\ninstincts all point the other direction. Not only do we try hard to\navoid bad news about ourselves, we tend to exaggerate the good news.\nImagine you and Jane are both up for a promotion. You want it bad, so\nyou stay late, you work weekends. Sure, some things still slip through\nthe cracks \u2014 but even those mistakes have really good reasons! Jane\nnever does anything like that.\n\nBut if she did \u2014 would you even know? We see the world from our own\nperspective. When we have to cancel hanging out with friends to do extra\nwork, we always see that \u2014 and feel the sacrifice. But when Jane does\nit, we see and feel nothing. You only get to see your own perspective.\nAnd even our mistakes make sense from our perspective \u2014 we see all of\nthe context, everything that led up to it. It all makes sense because we\nsaw it happen. When we screw up, it\u2019s for a reason. When other people\nscrew up, it\u2019s because they\u2019re screwups.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLooking at ourselves objectively isn\u2019t easy. But it\u2019s essential if we\never want to get better. And if we don\u2019t do it, we leave ourselves open\nto con artists and ethical compromisers who prey on our desire to\nbelieve we\u2019re perfect. There\u2019s no one solution, but here are some tricks\nI use to get a more accurate sense of myself:\n\n*Embrace your failings.* Be willing to believe the worst about yourself.\nRemember: it\u2019s much better to accept that you\u2019re a selfish, racist moron\nand try to improve, than to continue sleepwalking through life that way\nas the only one who doesn\u2019t know it.\n\n*Studiously avoid euphemism.* People try and sugarcoat the tough facts\nabout themselves by putting them in the best light possible. They say\n\u201cWell, I was going to get to it, but then there was that big news story\ntoday\u201d and not \u201cYeah, I was procrastinating on it and started reading\nthe news instead.\u201d Stating things plainly makes it easier to confront\nthe truth.\n\n*Reverse your projections.* Every time you see yourself complaining\nabout other groups or other people, stop yourself and think: \u201cis it\npossible, is there any way, that someone out there might be making the\nsame complaints about me?\u201d\n\n*Look up, not down.* It\u2019s always easy to make yourself look good by\nfinding people even worse than you. Yes, we agree, you\u2019re not the worst\nperson in the world. That\u2019s not the question. The question is whether\nyou can get better \u2014 and to do that you need to look at the people who\nare even better than you.\n\n*Criticize yourself.* The main reason people don\u2019t tell you what they\nreally think of you is they\u2019re afraid of your reaction. (If they\u2019re\nright to be afraid, then you need to start by working on that.) But\npeople will feel more comfortable telling you the truth if you start by\ncriticizing yourself, showing them that it\u2019s OK.\n\n*Find honest friends.* There are some people who are just congenitally\nhonest. For others, it\u2019s possible to build a relationship of honesty\nover time. Either way, it\u2019s important to find friends who you can trust\nto tell to tell you the harsh truths about yourself. *This is really\nhard* \u2014 most people don\u2019t like telling harsh truths. Some people have\nhad success providing an anonymous feedback form for people to submit\ntheir candid reactions.\n\n*Listen to the criticism.* Since it\u2019s so rare to find friends who will\nhonestly criticize you, you need to listen extra-carefully when they do.\nIt\u2019s tempting to check what they say against your other friends. For\nexample, if one friend says the short story you wrote isn\u2019t very good,\nyou might show it to some other friends and ask them what they think.\nWow, they all think it\u2019s great! Guess that one friend was just an\noutlier. But the fact is that most of your friends are going to say it\u2019s\ngreat because they\u2019re your friend; by just taking their word for it, you\nend up ignoring the one person who\u2019s actually being honest with you.\n\n*Take the outside view.* As I said before, we\u2019re always locked in our\nown heads, where everything we do makes sense. So try seeing what you\nlook like from the outside for a bit, assuming you don\u2019t know any of\nthose details. Sure, your big money-making plan sounds like a great idea\nwhen you explain it, but if you throw that away, is there any external\nevidence that it will work?\n\n**Next in this series:** [Lean into the\npain](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  \u201c[Ignaz Semmelweis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis)\u201d,\n    *Wikipedia* ([visited\n    2012-08-13](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ignaz_Semmelweis&oldid=501540461)).\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:fn1)\n\n2.

The sun shines brightly upon a\npark with green grass and tall shady trees and vibrant swings with\nchildren. The park is an oval and the perimeter is lined with small,\npastel-colored buildings. Here and there are a smattering of small cafes\nand restaurants. And the other buildings are filled with startups.\nTwitter here. Adaptive Path there. Even Yahoo, when it wanted to\nencourage its employees to be more startup-y, opened up an office in the\nneighborhood. Sit on the grass and chances are you\u2019ll sit near a friend\nfrom another company or bump into them in line at a cafe. The place\ncrawls with companies and back on the street, surveying the scene with a\ndistant but watchful eye, lie the journalists, whose publications cover\nwith awe the rumblings of those below. It was here that Newsflip made\nits home.\n\nJason entered the building expecting to be greeted warmly by the relaxed\nstartup world. Instead, the scene he entered was utter chaos. \u201cGet me\nCNN!\u201d shouted a man at the front of the room, apparently to no one in\nparticular. Others buzzed at their desks, shouting to one another,\nshouting at their phones, shouting at their computers, shouting at their\ncoffee mugs. One guy just seemed to keep spinning around in his chair\nfor no reason in particular.\n\nJason stood around surveying the scene for a moment until a man standing\nup motioned for him to come over. \u201cWhat do you mean we can\u2019t get CNN?\u201d\nhe shouted into his phone. \u201cThis is America.\u201d He placed his hand over\nthe phone and looked down. \u201cYou must be Jason,\u201d he said. \u201cUh, yes, sir.\nAre you\u2014\u201d \u201cGoddamn it, I don\u2019t care if you have to *buy* it, I want a 5\nminute segment on Wolf Blitzer.\u201d He covered the phone again. \u201cIt\u2019s great\nto have you on the team, son.\u201d Jason thought this was a bit fast to be\nadopted as a son, but didn\u2019t feel like he could press the point.\n\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t have time for this shit,\u201d he suddenly barked. \u201cJust get me\non CNN.\u201d He slammed the phone down, sat down on the side of the desk,\nand adopted an avuncular tone. \u201cLet me tell you a little story,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cUh, OK,\u201d Jason said, but the man talked right over him.\n\n\u201cOne day, not long after I graduated college, I was waiting at a bus\nstop. And sitting there on the seat beside me was a magazine, opened to\nan article about a newspaper. So I read the article and it just took my\nbreath away. Took my breath away. And I said to myself, \u2018Self, one day\nyou\u2019re going to be running a newspaper like that.\u2019 Well, it took me\ntwenty years to do it, but here I am. Sure, technically we don\u2019t use\npaper, but we print news all the same, right? Anyway, isn\u2019t that\namazing?\u201d\n\nJason just smiled and nodded.\n\n\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t get there just by sitting back and watching. No,\nsir. I got there by joining someone else\u2019s startup, seeing how it was\ndone, and then using what I\u2019d learned to turn around and start a new\ncompany to destroy their main product. Heh, heh. Well, I guess what I\u2019m\nsaying is that I better keep an eye out on you. Better keep an eye out\non you.\u201d\n\nJason looked a bit worried. And puzzled.\n\n\u201cAnyway, as you can see things are a bit crazy around here.\u201d He waved\nhis arm past the still-chaotic room. \u201cSo I better get back to work. But\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll settle in fine \u2014 and if there\u2019s any trouble you just let\nme know. Good luck!\u201d he added and then picked up the phone again and\nstarted screaming without even dialing.\n\nLooking for his desk, Jason wandered around the office for a bit, past\nthe spinning, screaming, slacking employees, until he found an unused\ndesk over in a corner. There was a memo on it, addressed to him,\nreminding him of the company\u2019s copyright and confidentiality commitments\nthat he\u2019d signed, which he promptly tossed in the trash.\n\nHe sat down and began inventorying the other contents of the desk: a\nflat screen monitor, a dual-processor tower, an IP phone, a keyboard, a\nmo\u2014. He noticed a tugging at his leg and looked down. He sprang back.\nThere was a girl beneath his desk. \u201cSssssssh!\u201d she whispered and\nmotioned for him to come towards her. Slowly and awkwardly, he crouched\ndown and crawled towards the girl. She pulled him under the desk with\nher and extended her hand.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Sarah,\u201d she said. He shook it. \u201cHi, I\u2019m, uh, Jason.\u201d \u201cHey,\nJason! Welcome aboard the team.\u201d \u201cSo, why are we down here?\u201d \u201cBecause\nit\u2019s crazy up there, silly. Why get involved in all that screaming mess\nwhen we can just slip off in the storm and hang out by ourselves?\u201d \u201cI\nguess. What\u2019s all the fuss about, though?\u201d \u201cOh, just some tech pissing\ncontest. Some blowhard with a webcam doesn\u2019t like some tech decision\nsome intern made and now everybody\u2019s going DEFCON 5.\u201d \u201cActually, DEFCON\n5 is the lowest level of military activation. I think you probably mean\nDEFCON 3.\u201d She just looked at him. He looked back and realized he should\nprobably shut up.\n\n\u201cSo Sarah, what do you do here?\u201d he ventured. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of training\nnewbies, silly,\u201d she said, and ruffled his hair. \u201cCatch me if you can!\u201d\nshe added, before darting out from under the desk and running across the\noffice. Jason followed in pursuit.\n\nShe ran to the middle of the roll of desks, then crouched down and\nrolled under one of them to the next row. Jason kept running to the end\nof the row to try to head her off at the pass, doing his best to dodge\nthe spinning chairs and thrown balls that were filling the office. Sarah\nmade a bee-line for the door, stopping only to grab the skateboard lying\nnext to it, which she used to skitter down the stairwell. Jason hopped\nthe whole flight after her.\n\nReaching the bottom, she sped out the door just as an overweight man was\nopening it to enter. He jumped out of the way and screwed up his face in\nanger. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d he shouted down the street at her.\n\u201cNope,\u201d replied Jason, running out the door after her.\n\nOn the street, she skateboarded around baby strollers, old people, and\ndazed-looking hipsters like a pro, while Jason was jogging as fast as he\ncould just to keep up. She jumped lights right before traffic, took\nbizarre shortcuts and side-streets, and occasionally turned back to\nlaugh at him. After a couple blocks of this she jumped up onto a railing\nand headed into a park. The next thing Jason knew she was halfway up a\ntree in the middle of a park surrounded by shopping malls and people.\nJason hadn\u2019t come this far just to give up at a tree, so he scurried up\nafterwards, finding himself balanced precariously on a branch. Once\nagain he found himself in a secluded spot surrounded by people, sitting\nalone, facing Sarah.\n\n\u201cNot bad, kid,\u201d she said.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne ambled in and pressed the button for the elevator. Once he got to\nthe office Trent spotted him at the door and, screaming a few last words\ninto his phone before slamming it down, headed over and led Wayne into a\nconference room. The office got silent as he walked by. \u201cFans!,\u201d he\nthought.\n\nTrent shut the door behind him. \u201cWayne, Wayne, Wayne, so good to see\nyou!\u201d \u201cGood to see you too, Trent! What\u2019s it been? A couple years?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, must have been that ETech two years ago. The one with that Bezos\nkeynote.\u201d Wayne laughed. \u201cHow could I forget?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, as I\u2019m sure you know I invited you here because we were all\nvery hurt by your comments on your show yesterday.\u201d \u201cOh, that silly\nthing? Well I certainly hope no one was too offended. I was just sharing\nsome concerns I had with the changes you were making. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cIf\nyou had concerns you should have just taken them to us. My door is\nalways open to you. You know that.\u201d\n\nWayne looked at him. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t. Let\u2019s be frank here. If I try\nto get an appointment with any startup in this city they push me off on\nthe calendar and jerk me around until three months have gone by and\nthey\u2019ve closed their B round of funding and the VCs have hired a\nprofessional public relations team to professionally sit and ignore\ncomments from people like me. But if I talk about it on my show I get\nushered into your conference room the next morning. So let\u2019s not play\ndumb here. You know as well as I how this game works.\u201d\n\n\u201cWayne, Wayne, Wayne,\u201d trent said shaking his head. \u201cWhat do you want?\nDo you want us to use this NNA thing? Done! You got it. It doesn\u2019t make\nany difference to me. I don\u2019t even know what the hell the thing does.\nLook, what do you need from us? Is that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Trent. You\u2019re a sweetheart. That\u2019d be great.\u201d \u201cWell I\u2019m glad we\ncould settle this so easily. You know, Wayne, if you ever need anything\nelse, just give me a ring. My door is always open. Hell, I don\u2019t even\nhave a door! Heh, heh.\u201d \u201cOf course, Trent. Thanks so much.\u201d \u201cHere, let\nme see you out.\u201d\n\nTrent ushered Wayne to the door. \u201cOh, there is one more thing,\u201d Wayne\nadded. \u201cSure, what is it?\u201d Trent asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve just been noticing\nin my referer logs that traffic from Newsflip has been dropping sharply\nlately.\u201d \u201cReally? I had no idea,\u201d Trent replied. \u201cNow I\u2019m not asking for\nany special treatment here.\u201d \u201cMo, goodness no, of course not.\u201d \u201cBut if\nyou guys could just look into the anomaly. Try to figure out what could\nbe going haywire. That would be great.\u201d \u201cOh, of course Wayne. I\u2019ll put\nmy top guy on it.\u201d \u201cThanks so much, Trent. Let\u2019s keep in touch.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nAll day, people came back and forth through Yerba Buena Park, while\nJason and Sarah hung from the branches above their heads, talking.\nIndeed, hours passed before Jason even thought to consult his watch.\nJason was used to seeing other people as a necessary evil: curiosity and\ncourtesy were behaviors he had worked hard to learn to imitate so that\nothers didn\u2019t find him too strange, but he did his best to make sure\nother people took no more than a couple hours of his time.\n\nSarah was different. She was the only person he\u2019d ever talked to who\nmade him feel completely relaxed in his own skin. He didn\u2019t have to\nworry about being someone else or trying to be interesting or checking\nthe time. They just talked and talked and laughed and laughed.\n\nSarah looked up at the sun overhead where it hung suspended above the\npark. \u201cHey, let\u2019s go grab some lunch she said,\u201d and swung down, branch\nto branch, before leaping to the ground. Jason followed, smiling.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne got back in front of the camera and pressed the button.\n\n\u201cAlright, for today\u2019s Internet Hero segment, where I keep an eye out for\nthe other people who are keeping an eye out for you. I\u2019d like to give a\nbig shout-out to one of my favorite Internet startups, Newsflip. I had a\ngreat conversation today with Newsflip\u2019s CEO, Trent Rayburn, and he told\nme a bit about Newsflip\u2019s philosophy and strategy and I have to say, I\u2019m\n100% on board.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of companies out there that just don\u2019t understand\nusers. They think you, the people who make their companies run, are just\npeople to be spat on and squeezed for cash. Not at Newsflip. There\u2019s a\ncompany that puts users first. And I salute them for it. So that\u2019s\ntoday\u2019s Internet Hero: Newsflip.\u201d\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Three](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity3)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1193986800.0, "postid": "bubblecity2", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity3"]}, "bubblecity3": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 3", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 3\n======================\n\nNovember 3, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity3)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next day was a Saturday but by the following Monday things had\ncalmed down and Jason could finally begin real work.\n\nHe began, as he always did, by trying to figure out the system. You\ncouldn\u2019t really work on something until you really *grokked* it:\nunderstood all the pieces and how they interacted and why they were\nthere. If you didn\u2019t get that, then you could spend days trying to fix\none piece, only to discover all your effort was wasted because your\nfixes would be ineffective as long as another part was in place.\n\nHe first checked out a copy of the code, staring at the list of\nthousands of files on his screen, trying to figure out where to start.\nAs usual, nobody had bothered to write down anything explaining things.\nSo he began opening pieces up, finding that they referenced other\nsections and bouncing from section to section until the big picture\nbecame clearer.\n\nBy the end of the day, he felt he had a pretty solid understanding of\nhow the whole thing worked. Not how people *thought* it worked, but how\nit actually did \u2014 what the code that actually ran the system said.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cWhat the hell were they thinking?\u201d Sarah thought, as she sat staring at\nyet another of the braindead interfaces the programmers had come up\nwith. She knew they had no contact with other humans but honestly\nsometimes she didn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t even figure out basic\nprinciples of decent design.\n\nShe started, as she always did, by trying to figure out the system. She\nlooked at the various pieces of the interface and tried to figure out\nthe different concepts they were manipulating. Programmers always\nthought of it in terms of how the system was built, but the users had no\nidea how the system was built and couldn\u2019t cares.\n\nYou had to think of it from their perspective: what was it they wanted\nto do, what were the things they encountered along the way, and how\ncould you make sure they felt like they were in control of those things?\n\nAnd then, once you figured all that out, how did you beat it through the\nheads of the programmers?\n\n* * * * *\n\nTrent\u2019s calendar warned him of an impending VC meeting. Running an\noffice like this \u2014 servers, employees, big looming screens overhead \u2014\nwasn\u2019t cheap. And since the site didn\u2019t run ads or have a revenue\nstream, the only way to keep the lights on was to trot back to the VCs\nevery six months with some impressive charts and some pleas for cash.\n\nHe looked through the names of the people he was meeting with and then\njumped over to scan their blogs. To pitch to people you really had to\nunderstand them. Figure out what made them tick. Everyone required a\ndifferent pitch and Trent knew exactly how to reshape it for them, just\nas Newsflip reshaped a series of links to meet the reader\u2019s desires.\n\nHe remembered what companies they\u2019d previously invested on, which ones\nhad done well, what they\u2019d mentioned their kids were into, what gadgets\nthey enjoyed, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 how Trent had cut them favors in\nthe past. This town ran on that sort of thing.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHigh above the Newsflip offices loomed a series of big screens with a\nrapidly-scrolling list of links. The lists were generated by a series of\ncrawlers which ran, 24/7, around various weblogs and social bookmarking\nsites. Every time someone posted a new link to their blog, or bookmarked\nsomething on del.icio.us, or voted for it on Digg, it saw it and noted\nit. Then another program took these triples (jon, del.icio.us\nbookmarked, lessig.org) and scoured them for patterns. Were a group of\npeople all bookmarking lessig.org today? Are a dozen blogs all linking\nto a particular YouTube video?\n\nIt then used these patterns to cluster users into groups. Jon, Jim, and\nJill all like YouTube videos about cats. Sal, Sue, and Sam all like\nnewspaper articles about copyright.\n\nAnd that way, when it saw a new YouTube video about cats, or a new\nnewspaper article about copyright, it could make a guess at who would\nlike it. And that combination of guesses made up the Newsflip front\npage.\n\nWhen you visited Newsflip for the first time, it\u2019d show you a bunch of\nthings that were widely liked by different groups of people. Maybe the\ntop link today about music and sports and technology and business. And\nwhen you clicked the one you liked the most \u2014 let\u2019s say music \u2014 it\u2019d\nshow you ten more stories from the various subgroups of music. In just a\ncouple clicks \u2014 music, pop, indie, guitar-based \u2014 it\u2019d have you figured\nout and know a great deal more about which kind of links to send your\nway.\n\nFrom then on, every time you visited the site it would use this\nknowledge to send you links it thought you might like. It would also\nshow you a few random popular links as well, just to make sure it wasn\u2019t\nmissing out on any other odd tastes you had. So every time you visited\nNewsflip it served you up a couple dozen stories it thought that you\nwould like. (Of course, it also noted down which stories you clicked on\nand said you liked, right along with the links and bookmarks.)\n\nAt the heart of it was the pattern-finding system that noticed when\ngroups of people seemed to be doing something. It was based on a system\ncalled Notated News Analysis (NNA) which had been invented ages ago by\nsome old guy who turned it into a public standard. Now dozens of sites,\nincluding Newsflip, used it to try to generate the best recommendations\nabout what to see on the Internet.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSamuel scrolled through his notes one last time before the meeting. Soon\npeople would be filing into the conference room and he couldn\u2019t afford\nto seem unprepared in front of them. He visualized himself standing in\nfront of the room, walking through the bullet points, smoothly ordering\nthe meeting, parrying questions, parceling out action items, dodging\nbarbs. He was ready.\n\nPeople filed in, pulled out their laptops, and engaged in the\npre-meeting chit-chat; the final moment of levity before the meeting\u2019s\ndreadfully boring waste of time. Finally, he tapped on the table for\norder.\n\n\u201cHey everyone, welcome back to the monday morning evangelism team\ncoordination meeting. As usual, we\u2019ll go around the table and have each\nteam bring us up to date on their activities. I\u2019ll start.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this week I gave a keynote at OSCON and encouraged developers to use\nGoogle Platform to host their apps. My main points were: 1) that this\nwas a new era of openness here at Google, where we were handing control\nof our computers to the community; 2) that we had by far the most\npowerful and scalable system for deployment; and 3) that we were always\non the lookout for the developers of the next hot application and that\nusers of Google Platform would be fast-tracked with the acquisition\nteam.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, HR?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this week we did a booth at the Ubuntu conference. These things\ncontinue to be an amazing value for us. The booth costs a pittance, we\nmanaged to snag four top developers out of it (gave them the usual\nbullshit about the Goog\u2019s commitment to open source), and we lined them\nup in job slots that are definitely going to take them out of the open\nsource world for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat work! Standards?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the big news continues to be NNA. Newsflip, a small startup up in\nSan Francisco, was trying to switch away from it but, of all things,\n*Wayne Darnus* turned the firehose on them and managed to talk them out\nof it. So now\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, Wayne Darnus?\u201d \u201cYup!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s his angle?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, he\nsays he invented NNA so anything that takes attention away from it just\nmakes him less important.\u201d Samuel broke out laughing. \u201cOh god, that\u2019s\nperfect. So what did he do?\u201d \u201cOh, you know, the usual. Did a piece on\nhow he was oh-so-concerned about all the poor users who would be hurt by\nthe switch.\u201d Samuel couldn\u2019t stop giggling. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said. \u201cThis\nis just too perfect.\u201d \u201cYeah, the guy\u2019s basically doing our job for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, exactly. Hey, that gives me an idea. Do you have Wayne\u2019s number?\u201d\n\u201cHis phone number?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cUh, sure, I\u2019ve got it here somewhere. OK,\n510-555-2414.\u201d Samuel picked up the phone and dialed it, repeating the\nnumbers back as he did. He made a shushing sound and set it on\nspeakerphone.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d came the gruff voice at the other end. \u201cWayne! Good to hear\nyou. Hey, this is Samuel Boxton over at Google Evangelism.\u201d \u201cGoogle?\nHey, I didn\u2019t say *anything* about Google on today\u2019s show. That stuff I\nsaid wasn\u2019t targeted you at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, Wayne, I\u2019m not calling to *complain*; I\u2019m calling to\n*congratulate*.\u201d \u201cCongratulate? Congratulate what?\u201d \u201cCongratulate *you*,\nsilly. On the great job you did with Newsflip. That was a real act of\ngenerous diplomacy you did there.\u201d \u201cOh, uh, well, I guess it was.\nThanks. But why does Google care about something like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Wayne. At Google we\u2019re just like you \u2014 looking out for\nthe users. Trying to make the best Web experience for everyone. We\u2019re\nreally 100% on the same page there.\u201d \u201cUm, yeah then, I suppose we are.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a shame that we\u2019ve never managed to collaborate before.\nOur interests are so aligned that it would really be great if we could\nfigure out some way to work together.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? Do you have\nsome kind of joint project in mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not exactly, Wayne. I was thinking more some kind of funding\narrangement.\u201d \u201cFunding arrangement,\u201d Wayne repeated. \u201cYes. Now hear me\nout: what if we funded The Wayne Darnus Center for User Priorities?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wayne Darnus Center for User Priorities. I like the sound of that.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you would. Now we\u2019ll give you a startup grant to help you\nestablish and operate the center, which will keep on doing the good work\nyou\u2019re doing to promote NNA.\u201d \u201cUm, OK.\u201d \u201cTo start with, I was thinking\nof an initial grant of around three million dollars.\u201d Wayne coughed\nsuddenly but soon regained his composure. \u201cUm, yes, well, I think that\nshould be able to cover our initial operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. There\u2019s just one more catch.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Wayne said, his voice\nfalling a bit. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWell, here at Google we don\u2019t want to make a big\nshow about how we\u2019re helping the Web. So it\u2019s essential our donation\nremain anonymous.\u201d \u201cAnonymous?\u201d \u201cYeah, you know how whenever you go to a\nmuseum or something like that it always says \u2018Generous donations by\nanonymous\u2019? That\u2019s just how it works in philanthropy.\u201d \u201cOh, I see,\u201d\nWayne said.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll be doing it exactly like that. The actual money will be\ndonated to you by a shell corporation called Rinaldi Tile, Inc. which we\nuse for these kinds of special projects and we\u2019ll have you sign a\nconfidentiality agreement prohibiting you from disclosing the real\nsource. You know, all the usual stuff.\u201d \u201cUh huh,\u201d Wayne said, a bit\nskeptically. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll send you the three million dollars.\u201d\n\u201cSounds great!\u201d Wayne said quickly \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have my\nassistant send over the papers in just a little bit.\u201d \u201cPerfect.\u201d \u201cBeen a\npleasure working with you. See you later.\u201d \u201cBye.\u201d\n\nSamuel hung up the phone and saw smiling faces around the conference\ntable. He smiled back and got up to take a mock bow. The room applauded.\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Four](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity4)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1194073200.0, "postid": "bubblecity3", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity4"]}, "bubblecity1": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 1", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 1\n======================\n\nNovember 1, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity1)\n\n* * * * *\n\nTick. Slip off backpack, place on table, slide out laptop, place in bin.\nTake out wallet, take out cell phone, take out loose change, place in\nbin. Face straight forward, wait for signal, walk through slowly,\ncollect stuff. Tock. Jason did not waste time.\n\nAt the gate he read a magazine, on the plane he read a book, on the bus\nhe checked his email. He went through familiar motions as if he had cut\nfrom them each unnecessary effort. He analyzed every moment of his life\nwith an unsparing critical eye. He walked down hallways with purposeful\nstrides \u2014 well, as purposeful as one can be if one is a gangly teenager\nattempting to carry a duffle bag bigger than oneself.\n\nThe woman behind the glass yelled at him as he tried to squeeze the\nduffle bag through the turnstile. The bus dropped him off five city\nblocks from his destination. His destination was closed and locked and\nempty and unfeeling and he was trapped alone carrying everything he\nowned in a city he barely knew.\n\nA cab sped by.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTrent stood up from his desk. Sometimes he did that. He wasn\u2019t going\nanywhere or signaling something. He just liked standing up and looking\nout over all that he surveyed. He savored the feeling of being at the\npinnacle of achievement. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get tired of that\nfeeling.\n\nOver there was the team he\u2019d hired away from Microsoft with promises of\na looser corporate culture and better weather. And over there, the\nstartup he\u2019d acquired after reading about them in one of the industry\nweblogs\u2014he couldn\u2019t recall which\u2014and after hardball negotiations bought\nthem and brought them here. And, over there, the UI designer, helping\nall the programmers to make their code more friendly. He watched them\nall working as one smooth harmonious unit.\n\nHe sat back down and looked over the day\u2019s schedule. First, a staff\nmeeting. He flicked through his PowerPoint one last time and then headed\nto the conference room to set up the projector. At 9:00 the computers of\nevery employee simultaneously chimed with an on-screen alert announcing\nthat a meeting was supposed to begin. But, as usual, the programmers\nwere so deeply engrossed in their work that they didn\u2019t even hear the\nbell. \u201cStaff meeting,\u201d he shouted, but still no one moved. Oh, those\nprogrammers. How dedicated!\n\nHe walked around the cubicles, pulling headphones off ears to make sure\neveryone got the news. They got up and followed him to the conference\nroom. God, programmers have such odd dazed looks and slackened jaws.\nSpending that much time in front of a screen really must be bad for your\nexpression.\n\nOnce everyone was settled in the conference room, he flipped to the\nfirst slide. \u201c25,000\u201d it proclaimed in white block letters against a\nstark black background. \u201c25,000\u201d he said out loud, just to hammer the\npoint home. \u201cWe have to do better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I know all of you are working hard. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see the way\nyou all hurry back from lunch exactly at 1 and get back into the groove,\ntyping furiously and shouting.\u201d He heard some muffled noises from the\nback of the room. He smiled; they thought he didn\u2019t notice.\n\n\u201cBut 25,00 is just not enough. I want 30,000. Alright. The other piece\nof news is that we\u2019ve got a new guy coming in today. He\u2019s one of the top\nstudents from this year\u2019s class at MIT, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be an amazing\naddition to the team. I hope you\u2019ll all help him get acquainted with the\nsystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, I guess that\u2019s it. Now back to work!\u201d he shouted, and laughed. He\nloved to keep the mood light.\n\nBack at his desk, he checked the day\u2019s schedule. Some phone calls, then\na lunch meeting, then a bit of a break so he could put the finishing\ntouches on his spreadsheets, then one more meeting ending right at 5 so\nhe could race out the door to his parked car and head home to his loving\nwife.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLazy day. Sarah slid out of bed and tossed on a tshirt and some panties.\nHer bare feet tip-toed across the wooden floor as she rummaged around\nthe kitchen for something that might be made into a kind of breakfast.\nSome granola over here. A bit of fruit over there. Just add a bowl and a\nspoon and you\u2019re done.\n\nShe ate it at the kitchen counter while flicking through the day\u2019s email\non her laptop: George, John, Tom, James, Jim \u2014 delete, delete, delete,\ndelete, delete. Sigh, no mail again. She checked a couple blogs,\nsplashed some water on her face, threw on pants, and grabbed her\nskateboard, tossing it out the window. Her bare feet soon followed. She\ndidn\u2019t wear shoes.\n\nDodging traffic on Mission Street ought to be some kind of videogame.\nSwerving past this street vendor only to dive in front of that old man\u2019s\ncart, then around again past the giggling children and ducking under the\nflailing arms of their screaming parents. And that was just the\nsidewalk.\n\nAt the office she hurried past the programmer cubicles, their windows\nstreaming last night\u2019s YouTube highlights and some networked videogames\nand the requisite bluster of the Wayne Darnus show. She slid down into\nher chair and plotted yet another day of how she was going to persuade\nthe programmers to stop making their interfaces so horrible. In other\nwords, another day of dealing with unceasing, uncomprehending rejection.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne woke up happy, as he always did. Then he sat down at his computer\nto read the news. One hand clicked through each headline, his blood\npressure rising at each fresh outrage, while the other hand grabbed\nhandfuls of cereal from the box he kept by the side of his desk. As he\ncrunched through the dry cereal, its sharp edges lacerating his gums, he\nfelt his anger turn to rage until he could no longer contain himself. So\nhe turned on his camera.\n\nHe popped open the recording software, making sure he got his nose\nsquarely in its frame, his face so close that spittle would land on the\nlens. In a world where every teenage kid could stream a live feed of\nhimself having sex to millions, only the most aggressive vlogcasters\nsurvived. Wayne was no dummy. He didn\u2019t get to be the number seven blog\nin the TechnoScene rankings by sitting back and offering his *opinions*.\nNo. This was war and every show a battle.\n\nToday\u2019s enemy? Newsflip, one of the crummy little online news aggregator\nsites, which was threatening to write him out of the history books by\ndumping the technology he\u2019d single-handedly invented, news notation\nanalysis (NNA), and going with some upstart competitor that didn\u2019t even\nbother to have an acronym for a name. Sure, Newsflip was a tiny site in\nthe scheme of things, but if it switched it would set a dangerous\nprecedent.\n\nHe pressed the button and watched the light go green. \u201cGoooooood\nmorning,\u201d he said, with his best attempt at the cheerful voice that\nCalifornians love. \u201cI was *seriously* disheartened to hear about some\ndangerous changes afoot at Newsflip. The company plans to abandon their\nusers by abandoning their support for NNA. Now longtime viewers will\nremember how hard we fought to get NNA adopted. And you won: now NNA is\nused on every major news site, is built into Windows and Macs, forms the\nbasis of the modern online news ecosystem.\n\n\u201cNewsflip wants to turn their back on all that by getting rid of NNA.\nThey claim they\u2019re doing it to make things simpler for users. But how is\nit simpler for users to get rid of one of the key features that they\ndepend on?\n\n\u201cBut frankly, I think the biggest loser if this move goes forward will\nbe Newsflip. Now, I\u2019m not saying that all of you should go out and\nboycott Newsflip, but as users I do think you should make your opinions\nheard. I\u2019ve always said, technology is about the user. Without you,\nthere\u2019d be no technology business. I think Newsflip might need to be\nreminded of that.\u201d\n\nHe pressed the button again and the light blinked off. There. That ought\nto show them.\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Two](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity2)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1193900400.0, "postid": "bubblecity1", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity2"]}, "bubblecity6": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 6", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 6\n======================\n\nNovember 8, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity6)\n\n* * * * *\n\nMiller ushered him into a clean, but ancient, little house with leather\nsofas and bright windows. \u201cTake a seat,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I get you\nanything?\u201d \u201cUh, no thanks,\u201d Jason said, a bit surprised at this\nreception. \u201cOK, I\u2019m gonna fix myself a drink,\u201d Miller said, heading into\nthe kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said in between noises of liquids mixing and ice\ncrunching, \u201cI always knew someday someone would call me to account.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re nice, but I\u2019m not about to\ngive out the backdoor to NNA to any pretty young thing that happens to\ncome out here and knock on my door. Anyway, even if I wanted to, I\ncouldn\u2019t. Yahoo insisted on wiping all my drives after I left the\ncompany. I don\u2019t have the key anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely you can reconstruct it? I mean, the code is open source \u2014\nyou can see the backdoor right there.\u201d \u201cYes, but it was a sort of public\nkey-style system. What\u2019s in the code is just the public part; anyone can\nread that. But it was generated from the private key \u2014 the series of\npatterns that will trigger it. Basically, what you see in those S-boxes\nis just the hash of the private key and it only kicks in if the hash of\na voting cluster matches.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why\u2019d you do it? For fun?\u201d \u201cOf course not. I knew it was wrong. I\nwasn\u2019t gonna pull another Dennis Ritchie. I was ordered to. The folks at\nYahoo insisted that if we were going to open source this engine they had\nto have a way of clearing out illegal and offensive stories; otherwise\nit\u2019d tarnish their good name. Of course, that department disappeared in\na reorg shortly after the software\u2019s release and I disappeared along\nwith it, so I suppose it\u2019s all kind of irrelevant now, except as a\nhistorical curiosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorical curiosity?\u201d Jason shouted, before realizing how loud he was\nbeing. \u201cIt\u2019s a major security vulnerability in a key piece of\ninfrastructure! Do you have any idea how bad this is?\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah, I\nsuppose technically it is,\u201d Miller said, \u201cbut let\u2019s be realistic here.\nMy copy of the key was wiped, everyone at Yahoo who knew about the\nproject is long gone, and there weren\u2019t many of them to begin with. It\u2019s\na dead letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Jason said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s using it. I don\u2019t know\nwhether they were at Yahoo or whether they got it from someone or\nwhether they figured it out, but it\u2019s getting used. There are anomalies\nin the recommendations that just can\u2019t be explained any other way.\u201d \u201cOh\ngod. What are they doing with it?\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s difficult to tell without\ncracking the key. The big piece I\u2019ve been able to spot so far is that\nthey\u2019re getting inane videos recommended to everyone. But who knows what\nelse they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you do. Just change the S-boxes and see what recommendations\nchange.\u201d \u201cAh, you\u2019re right! I just need to feed it the live input! If I\ngive that to two versions with no randomness and different S-boxes, the\ndifference will have to be exactly the orders from the backdoor. And oh\ngod, and that\u2019ll tell me what the key is: I just remove all the pieces\nof the input that don\u2019t affect the difference and whatever\u2019s left must\nbe what triggers the backdoor. That\u2019s brilliant! I just need to get my\nhands on a copy of the live database and some computers. Wow, thanks so\nmuch.\u201d \u201cGlad to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll come forward? Tell the world about the security hole you put\nin so we can force people to take it out?\u201d Miller laughed. \u201cNot a\nchance.\u201d \u201cBut I thought you said \u2014 you said you were against it.\u201d \u201cI am,\nbut look around. See this house? This couch? This cozy little place in\nthe woods. I got to retire early on my Yahoo stock options. And I got\nthose by signing some pretty iron-clad non-disclosure agreements. I talk\nabout any of this in public and I spend the rest of my life in court,\nwatching all of this get taken away. Sorry, kid, but you\u2019re on your own\non this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, but,\u201d Jason said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how important this is? The\nintegrity of the world\u2019s news is at stake!\u201d \u201cAnd you seem like just the\none to save it,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn fact, it seems like you already have\nyour solution all figured out. All I can really say is best of luck to\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, but,\u201d Jason said, exasperated. \u201cWell, the very least you can do is\nwalk me through the code.\u201d Miller just laughed. \u201cThat code\u2019s gotten so\ncrusty since the last time I touched it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person\non Earth who really understands it anymore. I guess that\u2019s why no one\nelse has caught the S-boxes. Everyone knows better than to go near that\nthing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, unless you have anything else, I\u2019ve got a game of Starcraft\nthat I really should be getting back to,\u201d Miller said. \u201cUh, I guess not.\nThanks for talking to me about it, I guess.\u201d \u201cOh, of course. Sorry I\ncouldn\u2019t be more help. But good luck, kid. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d And with\nthat Miller showed him the door. And Jason found himself standing alone\nin the middle of a hillside, wondering how a kid like him was going to\nsave the news.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen he got back, he quietly made a dump of the Newsflip database and\nrejiggered his program to try to dissect the live DB instead of\ngenerating random ones. He quickly saw much better results. Within hours\nit had pared things down to just a couple hundred thousand\npossibilities.\n\nWhile he was waiting, he pored over the diffs he\u2019d generated as Miller\nhad suggested: the changes that the backdoor had made to people\u2019s\nrecommendations. The first thing he noticed was that just about everyone\nwas seeing crummy stories: the video of the dog peeing, news about dumb\ncelebrities, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, real news \u2014 like the attack\non Iran \u2014 was completely buried. Only a small handful ever saw it.\n\nJason was shocked. The American people weren\u2019t being dumb \u2014 obsessed\nwith celebrity over politics, with bodily fluids over intellectualism.\nThat\u2019s just what they were being fed. And there was someone out there\nmaking sure of that.\n\nJason was bubbling mad \u2014 and his anger only increased as he watched the\nelements tick away on his little script to search for the backdoor \u2014\neach tick making his blood boil higher. And as it was almost done, the\nphone rang. It was Sarah.\n\n\u201cHey kiddo,\u201d she sang. \u201cCaught you playin\u2019 hooky at the office? What\u2019s\nup?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, not much,\u201d Jason lied. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d work from\nhome today.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, I get sick of those slobs too. Hey, want to come\nover to my place and keep me company?\u201d \u201cUh, well,\u201d Jason started. \u201cOh,\ndon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got wifi and everything \u2014 you can work from here just\nfine. I promise I won\u2019t distract you\u2026 too much.\u201d\n\nJason knew he should stay at home and finish what he\u2019d started, but a\ntingle of excitement ran through his body, telling him he really ought\nto see Sarah. \u201cOK, how about I come over there in twenty minutes?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said, and gave him her address. \u201cSee you soon!\u201d \u201cSee\nyou,\u201d he said, and hung up.\n\nBy then the computer had cracked the code and he went over to see what\nwas what. It was, as predicted, a bunch of bookmarks, but in some weird\nseries that Jason couldn\u2019t quite follow. He tried reproducing it by\ncreating some dummy accounts of his own, but before he could really\npuzzle things out he realized that he\u2019d promised Sarah he\u2019d be there ten\nminutes ago and dropped what he was working on to run for the door.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDeep inside the Googleplex, behind a set of keycard-locked doors, behind\nanother set that required keys for entry, behind another set that\nclearly read \u201cNO VISITORS BEYOND THIS POINT\u201d, lay a series of employees\nthat, except for the slightly-heightened security, seemed like all the\nothers.\n\nTom was going through his daily rounds of checking on the recommender\nresults when he noticed a certain story was being recommended to him\ntwice. The recommender was programmed to only recommend the same story\nto someone only once, so that never happened \u2014 unless one of his\nteammates screwed up. \u201cHey Kevin, get over here. You fucked up again.\u201d A\nmiffed-looking British fellow headed over to Tom\u2019s desk. \u201cWhat are you\ntalking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fucked up \u2014 I\u2019m seeing this dog story getting recommended twice.\u201d\n\u201cBut how can that be?\u201d Kevin asked. \u201cI put in safeguards to make sure\nthat never happened again. Unreal. Are you sure it\u2019s not on your end?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not on my end \u2014 I\u2019m looking at the raw recommendation\noutput.\u201d \u201cAlright, alright, well trace it back. See which posts are\nconflicting.\u201d \u201cOK, give me a second. Here, grab a chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, this is weird,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize any of these\naccounts. Do you?\u201d \u201cNumbered account names? We\u2019d never be so blatant.\nFuck. You know what this means, right?\u201d \u201cWe have an incompetent intern?\u201d\n\u201cNo, moron, it means someone\u2019s onto us. They\u2019ve figured out the back\ndoor and they\u2019re testing it for themselves.\u201d \u201cOh shit. Shit, shit, shit.\nWhat do we do?\u201d \u201cWhat can we do? We gotta talk to Saul.\u201d\n\nThey headed over to a slightly larger cubicle hidden in a corner. \u201cSaul,\nwe\u2019ve got a situation here.\u201d \u201cSituation?\u201d Saul asked. \u201cWhat is this?\nSome kind of spy movie? What\u2019re you talking about?\u201d \u201cSomeone else has\nfound the backdoor. We spotted a bunch of bookmarks in the same pattern\nas we\u2019re using from a different set of accounts.\u201d \u201cFuck. OK, well,\nthanks for telling me.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to do. You\u2019re going to walk calmly back to your\ndesks. You\u2019re going to write up everything you\u2019ve learned so far and\nplace it on this Flash drive.\u201d He removed a small USB keyfob from inside\nhis desk. You\u2019re then going to give me the keyfob, wipe everything\nrelated from your machines, and pretend this never ever happened, you\nunderstand? This is out of your hands now. I\u2019m going to make sure this\ngets\u2026 taken care of.\u201d Tom and Kevin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWait,\u201d Tom said,\n\u201cyou don\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d Saul replied. \u201cThis is a job for\u2026 public\nrelations.\u201d\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Seven](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity7)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1194508800.0, "postid": "bubblecity6", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity7"]}, "2008books": {"post_title": "2008 Review of Books", "tags": [], "post_content": "2008 Review of Books\n====================\n\nJanuary 3, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Previously:* [2007 Review of\nBooks](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007), [Books I recommend\nWithout Reservation: 2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)\n\nI read exactly 100 books this year. I mistakenly told someone over the\nsummer that I read a hundred books a year (I only read 70 last year,\nalthough 120 the year before that) and as the new year approached I felt\nduty-bound to make that true. (This led to spending a lot of New Year\u2019s\nEve in a corner reading, as this list may suggest.)\n\nHere are the books (in chronological order), with occasional short\ncomments. Books I\u2019m happy to have read are linked. Books I recommend are\nin bold.\n\n1.  *[Quantum Theory: A Very Short\n    Introduction](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0192802526)*.

Lodge, ***[Changing\n    Places](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140170987)***.\n\n    Typical campus novel fun, but with some great People\u2019s Park stories.\n\n7.  Elster, *[Political\n    Psychology](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521422868)*. Short Elster\n    essay collection. Probably for Elster fans only.\n\n8.  *[Lords of Poverty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871134691)*\n    (skipped parts)\n9.  *On Being Nonprofit*. Completely unmemorable.\n10. *How to Do Things with Words*. Important in its time, but mostly\n    overtaken by Searle\u2019s later work.\n11. *The Revolution Will Not Be Televised*\n12. *Campaign Finance Reform and the Future of the Democratic Party*\n13. ***[The Visible Hand](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674940520)*.**\n\n    Tough sledding, but important points.

Fitch, *[Solidarity for\n    Sale](http://books.theinfo.org/go/189162072X)*. For leftists who\n    really love unions. You need to know the flaws to make them better.\n\n19. Maisel, *[From Obscurity to Oblivion: Running in the Congressional\n    Primary](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0870493477)*. Not a lot of\n    books on the inside of campaigns, but this is one of the few.\n20. Segaran, *[Programming Collective\n    Intelligence](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0596529325)*. Terrible\n    title, but a good book on how to do data mining.\n21. Willis, *[Learning to\n    Labor](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231053576)*.

Hoopes, ***[False\n    Prophets](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738207985)***\n\n    A wonderful series of profiles of the most prominent management\n    theorists going back to slavery and Taylor. The book\u2019s editorial\n    line is a bit marred by the inability of the author (a B-School prof\n    and manager) to reconcile his belief that management power is unjust\n    and that it is necessary. But solid history and good takedowns of\n    some important figures.\n\n26. Dani Rodrik, *[Has Globalization Gone Too\n    Far?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0881322415)* (lent by Henry\n    Farrell). A good book, but not for general readers.\n\n27. *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Mixed feelings.\n28. Wilson, ***[To The Finland\n    Station](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1590170334)*.**\n\n    Really, really good.

Everyone should know about con men. (The BBC\u2019s *Hustle* is\n    obviously a television adaptation of the book.)\n\n30. *A Choice Not an Echo: The Inside Story of How American Presidents\n    Are Chosen*. Still crazy after all these years, although the whole\n    anti-backroom thing is interesting. I read it to see what you could\n    airdrop on college kids.\n\n31.

Gelman et. al., *[Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor\n    State](http://redbluerichpoor.com/)* (sent by Andrew Gelman).

Wanted to see it before the movie came out.\n\n54. Tilly, *Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons*\n\n55. Mann, *[Sources of Social Power, Vol.\n    1](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000PS4V0W)*\n\n    Tough reading, but really fascinating stuff.\n\n56. Frank, *[The Wrecking\n    Crew](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805079882)*. Lots of good dirt,\n    but not exactly the most rigorous theoretical argument.\n\n57. Perry, *[Spectrum](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844671356)*. Perry\n    is great \u2014 the autoinvestigatorial last chapter alone is worth it.\n58. Bearman et. al.,\n    *[Doormen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226039692)*. I read this\n    because I now have a doorman and am uncomfortable about it. This\n    helped.\n59. Teles, *[Rise of the Conservative Legal\n    Movement](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691122083)*. Good stuff,\n    although narrow.\n60. DFW, *[McCain\u2019s Promise](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316040533)*.\n    Brilliant, naturally. I\u2019d read *Up, Simba!* before, of course, but I\n    read this out loud to a friend and it was just a joy to do.\n61. Ken Silverstein,\n    *[Turkmeniscam](http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X)*.\n\n    Great fun. Not just a great story of investigative journalism, but\n    lots of interesting and important background as well. I\u2019m a huge\n    Silverstein fan.\n\n62. **DFW**, *[Everything and\n    More](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393326292)*.\n\n    This book is an interesting, but, I think, ultimately unsuccessful\n    experiment. DFW tries to teach math by channelling his favorite math\n    teacher \u2014 writing in the style of an excitable lecturer, completely\n    with verbal tics and backtracking (which, in printed form, becomes\n    kind of a running gag).\n\n    It\u2019s certainly not a bad book by any means, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\n    really a successful model for how books can teach math.\n\n63. Wodehouse, *[Psmith in the\n    City](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1585674788)*. Hilarious. Psmith is\n    a delight. I want to hear him acted but the recent BBC version is\n    dreadful.\n\n64. Clark, *[Organizing Our Marvellous Neighbours](http://en-ca.org/)*\n    (skimmed parts)\n65. *[How Wikipedia Works](http://howwikipediaworks.com/)* (skimmed\n    parts)\n66. Latour and Woolgar, *[Laboratory\n    Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/069102832X)*. Delightful. I\n    apologize humbly and abjectly for ever criticizing the strong\n    programme of science. Sokal and Bricmont led me badly astray on that\n    one.\n67. DFW, *[Consider the\n    Lobster](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316013323)*\n\n    DFW\u2019s suicide hit me very hard. I ended up coping [by reading every\n    piece of nonfiction he\u2019d ever\n    published](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/David_Foster_Wallace_nonfiction).\n    He was a brilliant, tortured man and I see so much of myself in him.\n    His nonfiction was fantastic and I will consider my life a success\n    if I can do half of what he did.\n\n    If you want to get started, I recommend (best work first):\n\n    1.  [Federer as Religious\n        Experience](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=print)\n        [[B/W\n        PDF](http://www.theknowe.net/dfwfiles/pdfs/Wallace-Federer_as_Religious_Experience.pdf)]\n    2.  \u201cDavid Lynch Keeps His Head\u201d, in *A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll\n        Never Do Again* (there\u2019s a *severely* abbreviated version\n        printed in *Premiere*; read the real thing instead)\n    3.  \u201cA Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again\u201d, in *A Supposedly\n        Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again* (the [*Harper\u2019s*\n        version](http://harpers.org/archive/1996/01/0007859)\n        [[PDF](http://www.harpers.org/media/pdf/dfw/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf)]\n        preserves most of the good stuff but is shorter)\n\n68. Krugman, ***[Peddling\n    Prosperity](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393312925)***\n\n    Probably Krugman\u2019s best book, it provides a throughly enjoyable and\n    enlightening *intellectual* overview of the economics of the 1980s\n    and 1990s. The delicious takedown of supplysiders is worth the book\n    alone, but the rest is great too.\n\n69. Tough, *[Whatever It\n    Takes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618569898)*. A great read; a bit\n    overly credulous \u2014 doesn\u2019t address Keynesian critics of intervention\n    or betray much skepticism about tests. ([my\n    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whateverittakes))\n\n70. Wolfe, *[Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak\n    Catchers](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0553380621)*. Great fun.\n71. *[The Homework Myth](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738211117)*.\n    Sometimes it seems like Kohn just gets narrower and narrower (via\n    email, he disputes this).\n72. *[Savage Mules](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672654)*. A good\n    antidote for faith in the Democratic Party. ([dsquared\u2019s\n    review](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/07/22/book-review-savage-mules))\n73. Beam, *[Great Idea at the\n    Time](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586484877)*. A fun historical\n    take down of the Great Books. Probably more fun if you know what the\n    Great Books are.\n74. *A Brief History of Neoliberalism*. Borderline unreadable. Why did\n    everyone rave about this book?\n75. ***[Love at Goon Park](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0425194051)***.\n\n    The first section is a (confessed!) retread of *[Becoming\n    Attached](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)*, one of my very\n    favorite books ([a 2006\n    highlight](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)). But after that\n    it gets much better and the interplay of animal and human stories is\n    a lot of fun. I\u2019ve been reading it to the five-year-old, who loves\n    animal stories of all sorts, and she just laps it up. (I skip the\n    incredibly dark parts, of course.)\n\n76. Newsweek, *[Secrets of the 2008\n    Campaign](http://www.newsweek.com/id/167581)* (full text online).\n    For campaign junkies only.\n\n77. Perlstein, *[Tested](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024)*.\n\n    Very good. ([my\n    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kindergartenkafka))\n\n78. Keynes, *[Economic Consequences of the\n    Peace](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15776) (full text online)*.\n\n    Wow, Keynes knows how to write. The first section is a must-read for\n    any diplomat. Chapters 4 and 5 (which unfortunately are the bulk of\n    the book) are only worth skipping or skimming for modern readers.\n\n79. Kaufman, *Synecdoche, New York* (scripts). What a movie! There were\n    a lot of script reviews that said things along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t\n    know if movies can capture a script this complex.\u201d Reading the\n    script now, you see the exact opposite is the case. The script is a\n    pale imitation of the film, missing most of what made the film\n    magical. Which just underscores what a great movie it was.\n\n80. Bowles and Gintis, *[Schooling in Capitalist\n    America](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465097189)*.\n\n    Not the easiest read, but brilliant. One of the very very few books\n    I want to read again (in this case, because I am sure I didn\u2019t get\n    it all the first time). The definitive Marxist take on education.\n\n81. *[Smile When You\u2019re Lying](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805082093)*\n\n    Tons of fun. I hate traveling and have never cracked a travel book,\n    but this angry and profane insider\u2019s evisceration of the industry\n    was still a complete joy. [Read Ezra\u2019s\n    review](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska)\n    \u2014 with [a comment from the\n    author](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska#comment-6236833)!.\n\n82. DFW, *[A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do\n    Again](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316925284)*.\n\n    Brilliant. Just brilliant.\n\n83. Keynes, *Essays in Persuasion*.\n\n84. Douthat, *Privilege* (lent by Rick Perlstein).\n\n    What is wrong with Ross Douthat? This book is eminently mockable,\n    but I have to say I could see writing most of it myself. Which is\n    weird, since Douthat is a staunch conservative and I\u2019m a\n    crazy-far-leftist. Is Douthat a double-agent? Or is he really this\n    confused about what conservatism is about? I wrote this summary for\n    Rick:\n\n    -   Prologue: Harvard is actually an education in the ruling class.\n        [Ross didn\u2019t like Harvard so much.]\n\n    -   1: Diversity policies ensure all sorts of ethnicities get\n        accepted but they all come from the upper class. [Big black\n        homeless guy starts living in Ross\u2019s dorm.]\n\n    -   2: The real ruling class gets tapped for private clubs where\n        they get connected to wealthy alumni and rape attractive coeds.\n        [Ross gets invited to apply at various clubs and rejected.]\n\n    -   3: Students are aggressive social climbers, calibrating who they\n        talk to and what activities they join to maximize their resume.\n        [Ross\u2019s friend\u2019s friend gets arrested for embezzling.]\n\n    -   4: Persuaded that the market is God and academia is a sideshow,\n        professors give students easy grades to help them get good jobs\n        and be rich (thus proving the professors\u2019 worth). Courses are\n        poorly taught and maddeningly specific \u2014 its very difficult to\n        get a solid general education. [Ross doesn\u2019t like his classes\n        and gets mediocre grades.]\n\n    -   5: Random drunken hookups are so common that the only way to get\n        any kind of commitment is to fall into a college marriage (of\n        which, I must say, there is a beautiful description pp.\n        145-147). [Ross falls head-over-heels for a totally agonizing\n        tease, only to have her give it up months later to a preppy\n        sailing kid who gets her drunk.]\n\n    -   6: Most harvard students arrive virgins and have a hards time\n        getting any while they\u2019re there, out of awkwardness and fear of\n        threatening their spot in the overclass. [Ross can\u2019t even get\n        laid at an all-girls school.]\n\n    -   7: The student body is primarily New Democrat, with a smattering\n        of vocal leftist protestors. [Ross supports the living wage\n        movement. [*ed. note:* wtf?]]\n\n    -   8: Harvard students spend summers at elite internships\n        acclimating to their future careers. [Ross goes sailing with\n        William F. Buckley!]\n\n    -   9: 9/11 sucked. [Ross laps up the patriotic spirit and the\n        Summers presidency.]\n\n    -   \u2026and then a tearfelt ending.\n\n    Sorry, did I end up mocking it a little?\n\n85. Gore, *[Sammy\u2019s Hill](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401360297)*. Yes,\n    I have a weakness for chick lit.\n\n86. *[What Motivates\n    Bureaucrats?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231106971)* A genuine\n    investigation (as opposed to the typical social science arms-length\n    thinking) into how Reagan affected the civil service. In short, our\n    civil service is the opposite of what you see on *Yes, Minister* \u2014\n    they were practically falling over themselves to kneecap their own\n    agency in response to the President. Kind of sad, but hopefully this\n    means that Obama will also have wide lattitude.\n87. DFW and Mark Costello, *[Signifying\n    Rappers](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0880015357)*.\n\n    A great book, although surprisingly the best parts are written by\n    Costello. A dense intermixed weave of music, history, race, law,\n    fantasia, and brilliant writing.\n\n88. *[The Telephone Gambit](http://books.theinfo.org/go/039333368X)*.\n    Decently researched, mixed in with self-indulgent (and just plain\n    bad) autobiography about writing the book. I wrote up a summary of\n    the story which I\u2019ll be publishing soon and you should probably just\n    read that instead. But everybody should agree that Bell stole the\n    telephone from Gray after this book.\n\n89. Krugman, *The Age of Diminished Expectations* (1st ed). Bleh.\n    Krugman\u2019s first book, back before he knew how to write.\n90. Bartels, *[Unequal\n    Democracy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637)*. I\u2019m also going\n    to publish a summary of this.\n91. Beam, *Gracefully Insane*. Like all good residents of Cambridge,\n    being institutionalized in McLean has long been a dream. After\n    enjoying Beam\u2019s other book (*Great Idea at the Time*) this seemed\n    right up my alley, but it was nowhere near as good.\n92. Gore, *[Sammy\u2019s House](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401309496)*. The\n    Gore books were bothering me because I could never figure out who\n    Wye and RG were supposed to be \u2014 all the other characters mapped\n    pretty obviously onto current politicians, but the candidates were a\n    mystery. I\u2019d somehow forgotten my first instinct: RG is AG, which\n    means that you have to think back two decades or so. Once you\n    realize that, everything falls into place.\n93. Wodehouse, *Mike: A Public School Story*. The first Psmith story.\n    Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket. Sigh.\n94. *[Ice Cream Man](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000JLTS8U)*. Good fun\n    for Tosci\u2019s fans.\n95. Kuttner, *[Obama\u2019s\n    Challenge](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1603580794)*\n96. *V for Vendetta*. Moore\u2019s whole story about how the movie softened\n    the fascism and anarchism seems completely bogus. That said, the\n    movie did change some fantastic parts, including V\u2019s televised\n    speech and the brilliantly convoluted *Hamlet*-esque ending. Also,\n    the movie\u2019s whole virus attack subplot was stupid. On the other\n    hand, the movie added some great stuff too. So see both, I guess.\n97. Krugman, *Pop Internationalism*. The essays Krugman wrote before\n    *Peddling Prosperity*, meaning it discusses the same stuff but much\n    more disjointed and poorly edited. I was hoping it\u2019d explain the\n    mystery of his animus towards Laura D\u2019A, but no such luck.\n98. *[First-Time Manager](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0814408214)*. A\n    much better book than I expected, but enough tin-ear corporate\n    silliness that I can\u2019t thoroughly recommend it.\n99. Searle, **[*The Campus\n    War*](http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/campus.html)** (full text\n    online).\n\n    Actually, a really good book on the campus uprisings of the 1960s.\n    First, there\u2019s some terrific first-hand reporting from Searle\u2019s\n    experience at Berkeley (in which he participated in all three sides:\n    the uprising, the faculty response, and the administration\n    counterattack!). Second, there\u2019s some good secondhand summarizing\n    about the experience at other campuses. Third, there\u2019s some good\n    analysis about why campus uprisings happen and what they mean.\n    Fourth, there are some interesting proposals for reforming the\n    university. (I, too, want to get rid of the trustee system.) Makes\n    me wish Searle did more non-philosophy books!\n\n100. Haggis-on-Whey, *Animals of the Ocean (In Particular, the Giant\n    Squid)*. Not as good as [the\n    original](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932416978) (now in its third\n    edition!).\n\nHappy new year!\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0192802526", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400076498", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0520229282", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316778494", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385242719", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140170987", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521422868", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871134691", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674940520", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691019347", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0415301084", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262633671", "http://delicious.com/aaronsw/donaldmackenzie", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/189162072X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0870493477", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0596529325", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231053576", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0192853929", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1595580271", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738207985", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0881322415", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1590170334", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385495382", "http://www.nybooks.com/articles/447", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691120390", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1856499928", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521777445", "http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aaaronsw.com%20elster", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140097198", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565847768", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088016", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670018554", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262072203", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521773628", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262550369", "http://redbluerichpoor.com/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140133968", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/193339241X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374529000", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/141656683X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401219268", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000PS4V0W", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805079882", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844671356", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226039692", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691122083", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316040533", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393326292", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1585674788", "http://en-ca.org/", "http://howwikipediaworks.com/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/069102832X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316013323", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/David_Foster_Wallace_nonfiction", "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=print", "http://www.theknowe.net/dfwfiles/pdfs/Wallace-Federer_as_Religious_Experience.pdf", "http://harpers.org/archive/1996/01/0007859", "http://www.harpers.org/media/pdf/dfw/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393312925", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618569898", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0553380621", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738211117", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672654", "http://crookedtimber.org/2008/07/22/book-review-savage-mules", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586484877", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0425194051", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015", "http://www.newsweek.com/id/167581", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024", "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15776", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465097189", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805082093", "http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska", "http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska#comment-6236833", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316925284", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401360297", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231106971", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0880015357", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/039333368X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401309496", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000JLTS8U", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1603580794", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0814408214", "http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/campus.html", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932416978"], "time": 1230969600.0, "postid": "2008books", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visiblehand", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/toolbox", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/predatorstate", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whateverittakes", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kindergartenkafka"]}, "bubblecity4": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 4", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 4\n======================\n\nNovember 6, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity4)\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, kiddo?\u201d They\u2019d already gotten to kiddo?

We have a noble mission. For decades, people\nhave gotten their news from a handful of conglomerates who\u2019ve bought\neach other up so many times that they can\u2019t tell their CEO from their HR\ndepartment. And news is important. Without the news, you wouldn\u2019t have\nany idea who won the latest sports game or why we\u2019re invading Iran.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re invading Iran again?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cAnyway, I just want you to\nknow that this is a company that makes a difference.\u201d \u201cI see, so we\u2019re a\ncompany that\u2019s out for a quick buck while thinking we\u2019re helping the\nworld.\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d Trent said. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve got another dozen meetings,\nso I better head off, but just give me a ring if you need me.\u201d \u201cOf\ncourse,\u201d Jason said.\n\nJason went back to his screen and decided to actually read through\nNewsflip to see this great new democratizing force, telling people about\nthe reasons we were invading Iran.

He wondered\nhow many other people got the same sort of treatment. So he opened up a\nraw connection to the database and did a query. Tens of thousands of\npeople were seeing the story about dogs peeing. Odd, he thought.\n\nHe needed someone to bounce things off of, so he called the best person\nhe knew for that sort of thing: Eric. Eric was brilliant. In the first\nbubble, he\u2019d made millions as a teenager who\u2019d managed to persuade some\nVCs to let him run a web news company. But the experience had burned him\nout badly and now he mostly slunk around his apartment in San Francisco\nand watched TV. Still, he knew this stuff better than anyone. Jason gave\nhim a call.\n\n\u201cHey, Eric, you got a moment?\u201d \u201cYeah, not like I\u2019m doing anything else.\u201d\n\u201cYou ever read Newsflip?\u201d \u201cLook, Jason, I love you and all, but I\u2019m not\ngoing to start using some website just because you work there. The news\nis a complete waste of ti\u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah, I know. I read your blog,\ndude.\u201d \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t think anyone did.\u201d \u201cOh, geez, you\u2019re the\ntop\u2014anyway, can you just go there for a minute and point it at your\ndel.icio.us page to generate some recommendations.\u201d \u201cYeah, uh, OK.\u201d\nJason heard some sounds of typing and sighing thru the phone. \u201cAlright,\nhere we go: 25 stories. Yeah, this stuff is total crap. Dogs peeing on\npeople and that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nOK, now Jason was suspicious. Eric was just about the last person on\nEarth who ought to be recommended that story. \u201cGod, Jason. What do you\ntrain this thing with? It\u2019s *terrible*. What the hell algorithm is it\nrunning anyway?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out. Mind if I swing\nby your place?\u201d \u201cNot really; you might, though.\u201d \u201cSee you in fifteen.\u201d\n\nJason packed up his laptop, ran down the stairs, and biked over to\nEric\u2019s apartment in the Western Addition. Eric answered the door almost\nbefore Jason had knocked. Inside was a den of total filth: clothes\nstrewn everywhere, pizza boxes piled high, no outside light coming in,\nand little inside light turned on. Jason hugged the wall to make sure he\ndidn\u2019t run into anything. \u201cTake a seat on the couch,\u201d Eric said,\ngesturing to a pile of crap in the corner. Jason tried to dig through it\nto clear a space big enough for his butt.\n\n\u201cOK, so I\u2019ve got the code on here that generates this stuff. Mind\nlooking thru it on here with me?\u201d \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d Eric said, clearing\noff a similar space for himself. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bug in the renderer; it\u2019s\nrendering the same recommendations for everyone.\u201d \u201cNah, can\u2019t be \u2014 the\nrecommendations are actually in the database. They\u2019re definitely getting\nspit out by the recommender.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, is the recommender just generating the same stuff for everyone?\u201d\n\u201cNah, can\u2019t be. People would have noticed that.\u201d \u201cPeople are more alike\nthan you\u2019d expect. Check.\u201d So Jason ran a few queries to see. \u201cNope,\nthere\u2019s definitely variance in what people are getting recommended.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Eric said. \u201cWell, maybe the recommender you\u2019re using just sucks.\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Jason said. \u201cWe\u2019re using NNA. It\u2019s state of the art. All the\nbig guys use it \u2014 Google News, Yahoo, even the new NYTimes redesign.\u201d\nEric laughed. \u201cState of the art? That piece of cruft hasn\u2019t been touched\nsince the Bad Old Days. Isn\u2019t there some new thing everyone is switching\nto?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; you obviously follow this stuff more than I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you just upgrade it to the new stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, I guess\nthat\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll talk to the guys,\u201d he said. \u201cOh wait \u2014 I just\nremembered. We tried that and Wayne Darnis threw this total shitstorm.\nYou should have seen the place \u2014 it was crazy. No way they\u2019re doing that\nagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s open up NNA and take a look at it,\u201d Eric suggested. \u201cI\u2019m\nsure it\u2019s a morass, but I can\u2019t think of anything else to do.\u201d \u201cFine,\u201d\nsaid Jason, pulling it up. Eric was right. They scrolled through it, but\ncouldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it. Things had been patched and\nrepatched so many times that it might as well have been written in\nINTERCAL. But Jason scrolled thru it as best he can, trying to see if he\ncould see something.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Eric shouted. \u201cGo back. What the hell is that?\u201d Eric pointed to\na block of numbers on the screen, sticking out from the rest of the\nprogram like a sore thumb. \u201cI dunno, I assumed it was just some\nconstants,\u201d Jason said defensively. \u201cWho the hell has a page of one-byte\nconstants in the middle of their program?\u201d\n\nEric looked closer. \u201cOh my god, these aren\u2019t constants. These are\nS-boxes!\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d Jason said. \u201cS-boxes! You never heard about those?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, again annoyed at Eric\u2019s habit of assuming everyone had\nhis encyclopedic knowledge for odd details. \u201cBack in the bad old days of\nencryption, IBM or someone came up with this algorithm called DES \u2014 Data\nEncryption Standard.\n\n\u201cNIST, the government standards body, ratified it and it went on to be\nthe standard encryption algorithm used in banks and computers and all\nthat stuff. But right before the government ratified it, they sent it to\nthe NSA \u2014 you know, the spy organization that hires up all the top math\nstudents to break encryption algorithms so they can better tap\neveryone\u2019s phones \u2014 for final approval.\n\n\u201cThe NSA said they liked it but they just had one little change. And\nthey fiddled with these things called the S-boxes \u2014 big lists of numbers\nthat your message was run through as it was encrypted. The NSA claimed\nthey just were helping make sure the S-boxes were as secure as possible,\nbut they never explained how or why they picked the numbers they did.\nSo, although it\u2019s never been proven, a lot of people assume the S-boxes\nare the NSA\u2019s backdoor into the private conversations of DES users \u2014\nthat there\u2019s something about the S-boxes that makes it easy for them to\ndecrypt people\u2019s messages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying, Eric? That someone put a backdoor into NNA?\u201d \u201cHey,\nI\u2019m not saying anything. I mean, I\u2019m sure there were perfectly good\nreasons that DES needed S-boxes; it\u2019s just that the NSA got to choose\nthem that was suspicious. Maybe the same thing is true with NNA; maybe\nthere\u2019s some good reason it needs S-boxes, although nothing springs to\nmind.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how would a backdoor in this program even work? It doesn\u2019t talk to\nthe network; it just gets stories in and pushes recommendations out. Am\nI supposed to believe that buried within these numbers are some secret\nrules to always elevate stories about dogs peeing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThink about it: it\u2019s the perfect\nsystem. The recommender doesn\u2019t talk to the network itself, of course,\nbut it gets fed tons of data from crawlers which, all the time, are\nscouring the Net for various pages and dumping some facts about them\ninto the recommender. The recommender could just keep an eye out for\npage patterns which match the S-boxes and use those as its\ninstructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re right! That\u2019s brilliant. And it would be almost impossible\nto trace, because any one of a million pages on the Web could have set\nit off.\u201d \u201cPrecisely,\u201d Eric said. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying some guy out has a\nseries of pages that encode secret orders, telling all the world\u2019s news\nsites to feature stories about dogs peeing?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, not at all.\nThat would be irresponsible. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s possible.\u201d Eric\npaused. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued, \u201cif he was smart it wouldn\u2019t be a series\nof pages \u2014 that\u2019s too traceable. He\u2019d just use Tor or some sort of\nanonymizing proxy to send the messages by voting through some dummy\naccount on del.icio.us or something like that. It\u2019d be impossible to\ntrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all just speculation, of course. We have no more evidence of it\nthan a bunch of funny numbers in a poorly-written computer program,\u201d\nEric quickly added. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s so perfect\u2014so devilishly clever. Hey,\nhang on a minute. My phone\u2019s ringing.\u201d Jason didn\u2019t realize how\noppressive Eric\u2019s apartment was until he left the heavy putrid air to\nanswer the phone outside. \u201cHello?\u201d he said. \u201cJason, you need to come\nhome,\u201d said the man on the other end of the line.\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Five](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity5)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1194336000.0, "postid": "bubblecity4", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity5"]}, "bubblecity5": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 5", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 5\n======================\n\nNovember 6, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity5)\n\n* * * * *\n\nStare. Stare. Tick. Tick. Ancient art hung on the walls. Ancient books\nlined the shelves. The light fixtures looked like they hadn\u2019t been\ndusted since Carter urged Americans to save electricity. \u201cSo, how are\nthings at the new offices?\u201d a wisened-looking old man sitting at the\nother end of the table asked. \u201cOh, fine, Grandpa,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cWhat\nis it you guys do again? Videos of models doing backflips?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Jason\nsaid with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re a news site.\u201d \u201cYou mean like the New York\nTimes?\u201d \u201cKind of, except we don\u2019t write the news, we just try to find\nbits of it for you.\u201d \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d \u201cWell, we look at everything\npeople on the Internet are reading and talking about and then we try to\npick out which of those people are most like you and tell you about the\nstories they like at the moment.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how well does it work?\u201d \u201cWell, uh, not so great, actually. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019ve been investigating lately.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, it\nseems like the site is recommending everyone the same inane stuff, like\nstupid videos and that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cAh, yes. Well, hate to say I\ntold you so, but this is just like that article i was reading in\u2014what\nwas it? *Foreign Affairs*?\u2014predicted.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cIt said that\nin the future we\u2019d have this personal newspaper all you tech wizards\nhave been promising us, only it\u2019d recommend us the same stupid crap\n(pardon my language) that average people have been enjoying for\ncenturies.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Jason asked, suspicious. \u201cDo you happen to have the article?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, it\u2019s right over\u2014\u201d the old man stood up to get it but then\nremembered he had broken his knee, the ostensible reason for Jason\u2019s\nvisit, and thought better of it. \u201cIt\u2019s right over there\u2014could you fetch\nit for me?\u201d \u201cOh, of course,\u201d Jason said. He pulled it down and flipped\nthrough it.\n\nIt was by the former editor of the New York Times and made the usual\nviritolic case for trusting human editors over some algorithm based on\nthe whims of random people. And somehow it found a way to compare news\nrecommenders to street vomit, which Jason had to admit was a\ndepressingly common sight in San Francisco. Jason briefly wondered if\nthe old media was using the backdoor to prop up their dying business\nmodels, but quickly decided nobody at those companies was clued-in\nenough to know what a backdoor was.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ve heard all this, Grandfather, but I just don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s your explanation? Just need to improve the technology, eh?\nBecause I\u2019ve heard that one more than a few times.\u201d \u201cNo, I think someone\nis trying to manipulate the results.\u201d \u201cWhat? Oh, god, you young people\nare always jumping to conspiracy theories. Why can\u2019t you just admit your\nprecious little system doesn\u2019t work? Why do you have to create some\nshadowy cabal of people trying to control the news.\u201d Jason just sighed.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your shirt say? Daring Fireball? What\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne quickly found that, although Google didn\u2019t want their name on the\ncheck or the web site, they were most accommodating in other matters.\nThey gave him a nice little office inside the Googleplex, let him play\nwith all the fancy equipment and company perks (free laundry, free\nswimming pool, free video games), and had a stream of people coming by\nto chat him up and suggest new ideas for promoting NNA.\n\nHe was a bit wary of getting so close to someone he had so often railed\nagainst, but he thought that perhaps this was his reward for his\nceaseless railing. Anyway, there were a lot of other evils out there to\nfight, and if working with Google made him more effective at fighting\nthose, wasn\u2019t it, on balance, a good thing? And the free food was nice\ntoo.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOn the plane back, Jason tried to figure out the meaning of the S-boxes.\nHe spent the first couple hours tracing the code, trying to understand\nhow it worked and how the S-boxes were used, before finally giving up in\nfrustration. It was just too complicated.\n\nSo, being a programmer, he decided to try a more automated approach.\nFirst, he took NNA and replaced its random number generating system with\na function that always returned the number 17 (17 was a pretty random\nnumber, right?). Then he made a copy in which the only thing he changed\nwas the S-boxes. He then wrote a program to generate random input files\nfor the recommender. It fed the same file to both recommenders \u2014 the\nnormal one and the one with the modified S-boxes \u2014 and it looked at the\noutput to see if there were any differences. Since he\u2019d taken all the\nrandomness out of the algorithm, any difference in output had to be due\nto the one thing that had changed: the S-boxes. In other words, the\nprogram would search for inputs that triggered the S-boxes.\n\nThere was just one problem: there were a lot of possible inputs. For the\nrest of the plane ride, his program tried thousands and thousands of\ninputs, but none of them showed any difference. When the plane landed,\nhe slipped his laptop in his bag and let it keep crunching, but he knew\nhe\u2019d have to try a different tack.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWayne Darnus told everyone who would listen that he had invented NNA,\nbut as far as Jason could tell, he was using invented in the most\nloosest of senses. Digging back through the changelog on the NNA source\ncode, which was provided for free to all from a project on SourceForge,\nhe found the code was originally written by some programmer at Yahoo,\nback when Yahoo had real programmers. Getting a name was near impossible\n\u2014 Yahoo had apparently insisted that all its programmers contribute\nunder the name \u201cA Yahoo!\u201d Some boneheaded corporate consistency policy,\nno doubt.\n\nBut the author must have given up his identity *somewhere*. Then it hit\nhim: mailing lists. No programmer worth their salt could give up a good\nmailing list flamewar. Whoever wrote NNA must have shown up on a mailing\nlist once or twice to defend it. Finding him would be easy: all Jason\nhad to do was read through ten or twenty thousand messages arguing about\nthe minutiae of NNA\u2019s design principles.\n\nAfter trawling through interminable debates in mailing list archives,\nfor what felt like days, Jason finally found a post from a man who\u2019s\npatronizingly knowledgeable tone unmistakably indicated that he was the\none who wrote it all. And the message was posted from home, so his\ncomputer had no qualms about signing his name. There it was in black and\nwhite, the man who had started it all: Dan Miller.\n\nDan Miller was a rather elusive party. He had no website or home page\nand despite NNA\u2019s incredible popularity, he\u2019d apparently never been\ninterviewed by the press. (Wayne had been interviewed endlessly, of\ncourse. Whenever someone neglected to include him in their history\nbooks, he complained about their lack of commitment to historical\naccuracy on his vlogcast.) Jason wasn\u2019t too surprised, though. Finding\nMIller hadn\u2019t been easy, and he hadn\u2019t known many journalists who were\nwilling to do much work to get a technology story.\n\nMiller\u2019s entry in the Yahoo corporate directory had long since gone\nstale \u2014 he\u2019d left years ago \u2014 and emails to his personal account bounced\nwith the message \u201cMailbox full.\u201d \u2014 overflowing with spam, presumably.\n\nHe just couldn\u2019t get a handle on this guy. So he called Eric. \u201cOh, yeah,\nMiller. Wow, there\u2019s a name I hadn\u2019t heard in a long time. So you think\nhe might be your source into cracking this NNA thing?\u201d \u201cSeems like it\u2019s\nworth a shot,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cYeah, I suppose it does. Alright, then,\nwell, I guess I\u2019ll look this up for you. What are we searching for? OK,\nhere we go: Daniel Miller, last known employer Yahoo. Uhhh, OK, he lives\nin Mill Valley, I\u2019ll email you his address.\u201d \u201cWow, Eric, that\u2019s\nincredible. Thanks so much.\u201d \u201cNo trouble; it\u2019s always nice to have an\nexcuse to use these skills.\u201d\n\nMarin County wasn\u2019t exactly known for its comprehensive public transport\nsystem, so Jason hopped a cab, which deposited him someplace random in\nthe middle of a hillside. He climbed around for a while looking for the\nhouse he knew must be nestled in it somewhere, before finally locating\nthe place. He navigated his way to the entrance, then knocked politely\non the door.\n\nHe wondered how a software developer could live in a place like this \u2014\nisolated from the rest of the Valley, away from the buzz and excitement\nof the industry. But then again, he wondered how a software developer\ncould live without having a website. Maybe Miller wasn\u2019t much of a\nsoftware developer.\n\nA man in a beard who looked to be about in his late fifties answered the\ndoor. \u201cHello?\u201d he said, apparently unaccustomed to receiving visitors.\n\u201cDan Miller?\u201d \u201cYup. \u201cHey there, I was looking into NNA\u2019s source code and\nI have a few questions. I know you probably hate to be bugged about\nsoftware you wrote over a decade ago, but I came all the way out here\nand I\u2019d really appreciate just a bit of your time to answer just a\nquestion or two about NNA.\u201d\n\nMiller smiled knowingly and gave Jason a long, piercing gaze. \u201cah, yes,\u201d\nhe said at last. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Six](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity6)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1194336000.0, "postid": "bubblecity5", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity6"]}, "bubblecity8": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 8", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 8\n======================\n\nNovember 18, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity8)\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cPoly?\u201d \u201cYeah, poly,\u201d she said, hunting for her shirt and putting it\nback on. No sense in being *that* forward when she answered the door.\n\u201cYou mean like polygamous?\u201d \u201cNo, silly, do I look like I have multiple\nwives? I just have that one\u2026\u201d \u201cYou ha\u2014wait, so what does poly mean?\u201d\n\u201cPolyamorous,\u201d she said, putting her socks back on. Jason saw her\nheading to the door and realized he better put on some more clothes of\nhis own. Because putting on some more clothes of Sarah\u2019s seemed wrong\nfor the mood. \u201cMultiple loves.\u201d Jason scurried towards his pants. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t instantly assume that just because I\u2019m seeing one person that\nmeans I can\u2019t see another.\u201d Jason tried to pull the pants up while\navoiding any unsightly bulges. \u201cI just don\u2019t sign on to that arbitrary\nrule of our culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not arbitrary!\u201d Jason insisted. \u201cWhat about jealousy?\u201d Sarah\nopened the door as Jason was struggling to put on his shirt. Jonathan\nwas standing there and she grabbed his head, gave him a long\nfaux-passionate kiss, and then closed the door again in his face. \u201cDid\nthat make you jealous, sweety?\u201d she asked Jason, a tad mockingly he\nthought. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, honey,\u201d she said, making out with him and\nsliding a hand down his pants. \u201cOhhh,\u201d he said. \u201cWell now I\u2019m suddenly\n*very* jealous,\u201d he said smiling. She pinched him and ground him against\nthe wall a bit before going to get the door. \u201cWell, when you get over\nit, you know where to find me,\u201d she said, pulling Jonathan inside. \u201cUh,\nwho\u2019s that?\u201d Jonathan asked, pointing to Jason. \u201cOh, he was just going,\u201d\nshe said, before dragging Jonathan into the bedroom.\n\n* * * * *\n\nJason tried to get back to work, to figure out the secret code that\nallowed one to take over the NNA algorithm, but he just couldn\u2019t focus.\nEvery time he tried to sit down to do the math, he felt tired or bored\nor distracted. All he could think about was Sarah. And all he could\nthink about that was how anathema to productivity it was.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t much he could do. He couldn\u2019t get Sarah out of his\nmind. And even if he could, there she was, just across the office,\nsmiling as if nothing was wrong, and forcing her way back into his\nconsciousness. So the next night he went back there. Sarah started\nfirst.\n\n\u201cOh, Jason, I\u2019m so sorry. I was incredibly rude. I just got so swept up\nin the moment, you know?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t more\nunderstanding of your, um, lifestyle.\u201d \u201cBut now?\u201d \u201cI think I can accept\nit.\u201d \u201cOh, Jason,\u201d she said, hugging him, \u201cI\u2019m so glad. I really do like\nyou.\u201d \u201cAnd Jon?\u201d \u201cWell, I guess I like him too. Are you OK with that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d \u201cAnything I can do to make it worth your while?\u201d she\nasked before kissing him, starting with his lips and then working her\nway down his chest.\n\n* * * * *\n\nJason had heard people say that getting laid made them more productive,\nbut he always found it a colossal waste of time. Not only the time\nwasted with your partner, but also all the time you spent during the day\nthinking about the time you\u2019d wasted or the time you would waste in the\nfuture. It made it hard to focus, worst of all now, when something\nimportant was at stake.\n\nHe put all thoughts of Sarah out of\u2014Sarah and Jonathan, sitting there,\nhis muscl\u2014anyway, he put all of that out of his mind and focused on the\nproblem at hand. How did this sequence of bookmarks lead to that\nparticular recommendation?\n\nAfter much procrastination, he cracked the code. There were a series of\naccounts, call them dummy0 thru dummy15, and a series of pages, call\nthem page0 thru page15. dummy0 linked to page0, dummy1 linked to page0\nand page1, dummy2 linked to page0, page1, and page2, and so on. Then\ndummy15 also linked to an additional page and that was the one that got\npushed out in all the recommendations.\n\nJason figured that the clustering algorithm must have discovered this\ncluster, noticed the odd behavior, and taken it aside for special\nprocessing. Not that anyone could know for sure without untangling all\nthat code.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDays before, Jason Blakeslee, Google\u2019s head of public relations, and\nreceived a visit from Samuel Turnbill, Google\u2019s head of evangelism. The\nmeeting was coordinated over Google Email, it was marked in Google\nCalendars, it was recorded by Google Video, and held on the Google\ncampus. In that, it was like many other meetings. And yet, somehow, it\nwas very different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recall NNA,\u201d Samuel began, getting down to business.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cWell, it appears someone found a piece of\nit that we were hoping to keep hidden.\u201d \u201cJesus, Sam, would it kill you\nto speak clearly? I\u2019m head of public relations, not the public.\u201d \u201cOK,\nOK. So here\u2019s how it is: there\u2019s a special control system in NNA that\nallows us to exercise some influence over the workings of the algorithm,\nfor administrative purposes and that sort of thing. Someone else appears\nto have discovered the control structure. If this gets out, it could be\nincredibly damaging. It *must* be stopped.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d Blakeslee\nexplained. \u201cI\u2019ll put our team on it.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Samuel said handing\nBlakeslee a USB thumb drive. \u201cHere\u2019s a quick explanation and all the\nrelevant logs.\u201d\n\nAnd thus the head of evangelism handed the drive to the head of public\nrelations who handed it to head of sensitive operations who handed it to\nhis tech lead who handed it to Mike. \u201cPiece of cake,\u201d Mike said.\n\nThe logs showed the IP address and time the perp had contacted Google\u2019s\nservers with his bookmark request. The IP address was a cable modem used\nmainly by one man: a Mr. Jason Barsto. Barsto had a Google account,\nwhich allowed Mike to pull up a pretty decent summary of his entire\nlife: his email, his calendar, his search history, what news stories he\nliked, where he lived, surveillance photos of his house, the top people\nhe chatted with, and on and on.\n\nNow came the fun part: compiling a dossier. Mike skimmed through\nBarsto\u2019s life, with the aid of Google technology that helped highlight\nkey concepts and messages, getting inside Barsto\u2019s head and trying to\nunderstand who he was.\n\nHe started with search. Barsto was a geek, the kind of person who\nsearched Google every time a thought passed through his head. Within\nminutes, he knew everything from what kind of error messages Barsto\u2019s\ncomputer was showing that day to what kind of porn he enjoyed. it was\nlike a raw feed into his stream-of-consciousness.\n\nJust in the past few hours Barsto had searched for:\n\n    big daddy  \n    galaxy halos  \n    guitar hero four  \n    san francisco library  \n    arguments against evolution\n    stomach cancer  \n    site:mayoclinic.org stomach cancer\n\nNext came email. Using Google technology developed for targetting ads\nand improving search, his system pulled out the key concepts and emails\nin Barsto\u2019s mailbox. Pretty quickly he learned who Barsto\u2019s friends are,\nwho his crushes were, who his boss was, and what he did with his free\ntime. Using his Google Chat logs, he found what Barsto liked to gossip\nabout and what crazy links he shared with his friends. (Luckily for\nMike, Barsto appeared to be the kind of startup geek who never saw a\nGoogle app he didn\u2019t use.)\n\nUsing the calendar, he discovered when Barsto went to the gym, when he\nwent to see his girlfriend, and so on. Connecting this with the Google\nfriend-tracking app Barsto had installed on his GPS-enabled phone,\nBarsto was able to get solid GPS coordinates for all of these places on\na Google Map as well as see where Barsto was right now. They could\nprobably ask his phone to record all of his phone calls for them,\nalthough Barsto didn\u2019t have that kind of clearance.\n\nSince Barsto used Google News and YouTube, he got a fairly good sense of\nwhat kinds of things Barsto was interested in and, thanks to Google\nCheckout, he was able to see all the recent purchases Barsto had made.\nBut \u2014 and here was the motherload \u2014 Barsto ran Google Desktop Search,\nwhich allowed Mike to access any file on Barsto\u2019s computer. He quickly\npulled up Barsto\u2019s full browsing history and got to see what kind of\nporn he liked, what blogs he visited, what he was reading about today,\nwhich non-Google apps he used, etc. (For people who didn\u2019t have Google\nDesktop Search installed, he got the same data thru Google Web\nAccelerator.)\n\nBy the end of the day he felt he knew Barsto better than he knew some of\nhis own best friends. He put the highlights of what he\u2019d learned into a\nreport for his superiors: Barsto\u2019s name and address, his occupation and\nskill-level, his interests and hobbies, his friends and girlfriends, and\n(his favorite part) a series of embarrassing or otherwise fun facts that\ncould be used for blackmail or simply amusement. (You wouldn\u2019t believe\nhow many people kept naked photos of themselves or loved ones on their\nhard drives!)\n\nHe sent the report to his superior and wandered off for a bit to dwell\non the power he had as a faceless person deep inside an office park in\nMountain View to know every detail of another person\u2019s life; a person\nliving just miles north in San Francisco. He wondered what it would be\nlike if he came across him on the street \u2014 here, he would know every\ndetail of Barsto\u2019s life, from the secrets he confided over IM with his\nfriends to what he looked like naked, while Barsto would see Mike as\njust another random face in the crowd.\n\nMike loved his job.\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Nine](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity9)\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1195372800.0, "postid": "bubblecity8", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity9"]}, "bubblecity9": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 9", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 9\n======================\n\nNovember 19, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity9)\n\n* * * * *\n\nDerren, head of sensitive public relations operations for Google, had to\nfigure out what to do about Jason. Normally Google prided itself on\nbeing very \u201cflat\u201d \u2014 few people were in charge, most people worked in\nteams. But the bosses had decided that public relations had to be\nspecial, which meant that all these tough choices fell on Derren\u2019s\nshoulders alone.\n\nBut Derren knew better than that. He\u2019d previously had a similar position\nat Yahoo, where the Chinese government made him give up the names of\nbloggers to their secret police. The guilt wouldn\u2019t go away for weeks.\nDerren was sick of that kind of stress.\n\nGoogle was a company of hackers, so when he moved there he got there he\nhad the programmers whip up a technical solution to his social problem.\nNow when he faced a tough decision like this, he punched the key facts\ninto the computer and had his team vote on the solution. That way it\nwasn\u2019t his decision \u2014 it was simply the \u201cwisdom of crowds,\u201d the\naggregated knowledge of Google\u2019s crack team of spooks.\n\nDescribing Jason\u2019s case would be simple:\n\n> Fresh MIT grad discovers backdoor in key public algorithm. Works at\n> related SF startup. Doesn\u2019t yet have enough details to go public.\n>\n> Should we:\n>\n> -   Nab him and begin the coverup.\n> -   Infiltrate his office and friends and follow his progress.\n> -   Do nothing.\n\nHe always left that last one in there just to make sure his ass was\ncovered. But it almost never got any votes.\n\nHe sent out the questionnaire and watched the results pour in. There was\nthe support from the kidnapping crowd for immediately seizing the kid\nand figuring out the questions later, but most of the team supported the\nmore cautious position. Fair enough.\n\nHe looked to see what staff he had available and dispatched one woman to\nget more details from the kids boss, just to make sure he was oblivious\nand dispatched a guy to get to know the kid\u2019s girlfriend. Finally, he\nassigned an office drone to monitor the kid and keep tabs on his\nprogress. The guy who\u2019d done the original work-up was still available,\nso he pushed the task back to him.\n\nBoy, this job sure was easier without the guilt.\n\n* * * * *\n\nJason started noticing them at the gym. Guys that geeky didn\u2019t work out.\nAnd certainly not with those dorky glasses still on. And whenever he\nbiked anywhere he was followed by an unusually large number of white\nPriuses. At first he ascribed things to paranoia \u2014 he\u2019d been having\nweird dreams ever since his visit to Miller == but when he got to the\noffice he ran some numbers and calculated the probability of seeing that\nmany white Priuses in San Francisco and realized something was up.\n\nDorks. Priuses. His work on NNA. What did it all add up to? Did the\nmedia industry have some secret San Francisco team working on the NNA\nbackdoor? No, that couldn\u2019t be \u2014 anyone the media industry hired would\nbe way more attractive. And then it hit him \u2014 the only organization that\nfit the combination of stealthiness, geekiness, and obsessive control:\nGoogle.\n\n*Shit*, he thought.\n\nHe looked around to see how they were tracking on him. Open on his\nscreen was a Google query for white priuses in San Francisco. *Fuck*, he\nthought, quickly closing it. They knew he was on to them; they were sure\nto close in on him now. He quickly set up a rule in his firewall to\nblock all outgoing connections to Google servers. He watched his other\nsearch queries, his email, his calendar, and his chats all go dead. Soon\nhis desktop search thing fizzled out too.\n\nHe tried to think of other Google products, but his officemate was\nlaughing at some stupid YouTube video. Oh, damn, YouTube. He blocked\nthat too, along with Blogger. In fact, he blocked the whole Google IP\nspace. There was time to figure out how to circumvent this stuff later.\n\nHe looked around for other Google products. Surely they couldn\u2019t track\nhim with his Google tshirts. But his phone! It not only ran Google apps,\nbut a Google OS. He had to toss it. He removed the battery, ran a magnet\nover the case, and tossed the result in the trash. In fact, maybe it\u2019d\njust be safer to toss his whole computer as well. At the very least, he\nchanged the password on his hard drive encryption and removed the\nbattery and power cord and stuffed it in his bag.\n\nShit, the dorks were at the receptionist. He had to get out. He ducked\nunder his desk so he could think. Soon they\u2019d be at his desk. He\ncouldn\u2019t be here. He vaguely recalled seeing some back door over by the\nbathrooms, so he crawled that way. Luckily, most of the office was too\nenthralled by their monitors to notice.\n\nHe snuck out the door and jogged to the BART station. He bought a new\nticket, with cash (just to be on the safe side \u2014 hadn\u2019t he heard\nsomething about Google beta-testing a new public transit program?) He\nrode the train all the way to Bay Point, on the theory that getting as\nfar away from Google as possible would be a good idea right now.\n\nHe spent the whole train ride shifty and nervously looking at the other\npassengers, seeing if any of them were suspiciously geeky. But few\npeople seemed to last the whole ride from San Francisco to Bay Point;\nmostly they got rotated. So eventually he calmed down and tried to plot\nhis next move.\n\nWhen he got off he began looking for a library where he might be able to\nget an Internet connection. He was obviously a bit wary of using Google,\neven though it\u2019d be pretty impressive for them to track him from a\nrandom library computer, so he went to\n[scroogle.org](https://ssl.scroogle.org/), a site that let you do Google\nsearches while hiding your IP address. Instead of visiting Google\ndirectly, you sent your query to Scroogle, which passed the query on to\nGoogle and then back to you, after stripping out all the Google tracking\ncookies and the ads.\n\nFor other Google products there was [Tor](http://tor.eff.org/), a clever\nlittle app that encrypted your Internet usage and bounced it through\nthree machines around the world before sending it on to its intended\ndestination. At every step, your traffic gets encrypted a different way\nand delayed a small amount, so that even an observer listening to every\nsingle bit of Internet traffic can\u2019t keep track of which was yours.\n\nThink of it this way: Imagine you want to get across town without being\nfollowed by a spy satellite that can see everything from overhead. Well,\nfirst you leave your house \u2014 the spy satellite can see that, of course \u2014\nand you head to a department store. Inside the department store, you\ntoss your clothes and buy all new ones. Then, when you come out, you\nlook like a completely different person \u2014 the guy using the spy\nsatellite can\u2019t tell which person leaving the store is you. Then, just\nin case the guy using the spy satellite cut a deal with the department\nstore\u2019s security cameras, you do this a couple more times with different\ndepartment stores. Finally, pretty confident you\u2019ve lost the spy, you\nhead to your final destination.\n\nTor works the same way, only instead of you there\u2019s your message and\ninstead of new clothes there\u2019s encryption. You first pick out three Tor\nservers (the equivalent of the department store) that you want to route\nyour message to. First you write out a note saying \u201cplease send the\nfollowing message to www.google.com\u201d with the message and encrypt it so\nthat only the third computer on your list can read it. Then you write\nout \u201cplease send this to [the third Tor server]\u201d and the previous\nencrypted message and encrypt that. And then you write out \u201cplease send\nthis to [the second Tor server]\u201d and the previous encrypted message.\nThen you encrypt that and send it to the first computer on your list. It\ndecrypts it, follows the instructions, and all the other servers do the\nsame.\n\nOf course all of this was for nothing if you ever logged into a Google\nproduct or even accepted a Google cookie \u2014 a special tracking number\nthat Google send out with every web page they serve. Most browsers\nautomatically save the tracking number and send it back every time you\nvisit something on google.com. Cookies were designed so that when you\nlogged into something like your email, you would stay logged in. The\nfirst time you typed your email and password, you\u2019d get back a cookie\nproving you\u2019d logged in. Then, every other time you visited the site,\nyour browser would send back the cookie and the site would know you were\nlogged in.\n\nBut pretty quickly, sites started using this to track all their\nvisitors. Instead of sending cookies only when you logged in, they sent\nthem to every user, allowing them to keep track of people even when they\ntook their laptop to a new place or disguised their connections through\nsomething like Tor. Google, of course, does the same, giving every\nGoogle visitor a tracking number that identifies their computer forever.\n\nThus, to be sure Google can\u2019t track you, you need to do at least three\nthings: never long in, never accept tracking cookies, and use some kind\nof anonymization of your IP address (like Scroogle or Tor). And that\u2019s\njust for the Web.\n\nGod, this was going to be hard.\n\n*Tomorrow:* [Chapter Ten](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity10)\n", "external_links": ["https://ssl.scroogle.org/", "http://tor.eff.org/"], "time": 1195459200.0, "postid": "bubblecity9", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity10"]}, "sciphil": {"post_title": "Science or Philosophy?: Jon Elster and John Searle", "tags": [], "post_content": "Science or Philosophy?: Jon Elster and John Searle\n==================================================\n\nMay 12, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/sciphil)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs the name suggests, the social sciences have often seen themselves as\nan analogue or extension of the natural sciences and have from the\nbeginning aspired to their successes. Like many who want to duplicate\nsuccess they do not understand, social sciences has been obsessed with\nduplicating the *form* of the natural sciences and not its motivations.\nJust as rival music player manufacturers have tried to copy the look of\nthe iPod without understanding why it takes that look, the social\nsciences have copied the structure of the natural sciences without\nunderstanding why they take that structure.\n\nThe greatest success of the natural sciences is undoubtedly the laws of\nphysics. Here, an handful of simple equations can accurately predict the\nmotion of a vast variety of everyday objects under common actions.\nSeeing this, social scientists have aspired to derive similar laws that\npredict the behavior of whole societies. (Others, meanwhile insist the\nentire project is impossible because the society will respond to the\ncreation of the law, making the law invalid \u2014 reflexivity.)\n\nBut reflection upon the history of the natural sciences will see that\nthis notion is insane. Physics did not develop thru attempts to discover\nthe laws that explained all of motion. Instead, various kinds of motion\n(like falling objects) were described, rules for their behavior deduced,\nand commonalities in those rules discovered. Eventually it was the case\nthat the commonalities were so great and the rules so few that a handful\nof laws could explain most of the phenomena, but this assumption was not\nmade *a priori*.\n\nJon Elster argues that the social sciences should proceed in a similar\nway: various social phenomena should be described, the mechanisms that\ngive rise to them explained, and the commonalities among mechanisms\ndiscovered. Most of his work consists of practicing social science in\nthis way, with a few attempts at laying out a toolbox of these common\nmechanisms.\n\nModern social science is so split between attempts at grand law-like\ntheories and modest essays of careful description that Elster\u2019s third\nway seems alien and hard to comprehend. But there is a clear model that\nsocial scientists can look to: analytical philosophy.\n\nAnalytical philosophers do not take as their task grand law-like\nexplanations for the world. Instead, they set upon a particular piece of\nconception \u2014 language, free will, ethics \u2014 and try to discover its\nlogical structure. In doing so they often develop tools they shared in\ncommon with other philosophical projects.\n\nThis similarity can perhaps be best seen in the work of the man who is\nJon Elster\u2019s closest equivalent in the world of analytical philosophy,\nJohn Searle. In his career, Searle has addressed a number of topics:\nlanguage, intentionality, consciousness, social reality, and\nrationality. Throughout he has taken has his task providing a clear\ndescription of the phenomena and explaining the pieces it consists of.\nAnd in explaining those pieces, he frequently develops tools that he\nreuses in his other explanations.\n\nTake the notion of *direction of fit*. Searle argues that all statements\nhave a direction of fit, which can be either up, down, both, or null. If\nwe imagine (by convention) that statements float above the world\npointing down at the things they represent, then statements like \u201cJohn\nand Jill are married\u201d, in which it is the job of the statement to change\nto accurately represent the world, have a downward direction of fit. By\ncontrast, statements like \u201cI want to marry him\u201d, in which it is the\nworld must change to match the statement, have an upward direction of\nfit.\n\nThis notion, which Searle and Austin developed for describing language,\nSearle later reused for describing mental states. Love, for example, has\nan upward direction of fit, belief downward, and joy null. And in my own\neveryday life, I have found the same tool useful in thinking about\nvarious phenomena I\u2019ve encountered.\n\nSocial scientists don\u2019t seem to read much philosophy. I suspect most of\nthem see it as an alien culture consisting of, [as Paul Graham put\nit](http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html), \u201ceither highly technical stuff\nthat doesn\u2019t matter much, or vague concatenations of abstractions their\nown authors didn\u2019t fully understand.\u201d But perhaps they should, because\neven if the technical stuff lacks interest (and considering some of the\ntopics involved, I\u2019m skeptical that this is always the case), the tools,\nand the way they\u2019re wielded, should be a lesson.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html"], "time": 1210575600.0, "postid": "sciphil", "internal_links": []}, "vgi": {"post_title": "Very Good Introductions", "tags": ["ideas", "writing"], "post_content": "Very Good Introductions\n=======================\n\nFebruary 22, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/vgi)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOxford University Press has a wonderful series they call [Very Short\nIntroductions](http://www.oup.co.uk/general/vsi/). The books are small,\nshort, colorful paperbacks with titles like \u201cThe Brain\u201d, \u201cPolitical\nPhilosophy\u201d or \u201cThe Tudors\u201d. For each one, the editors find an expert in\nthe field, have them write a brief overview of all the relevant areas of\nstudy (thus the book on \u201cGlobalization\u201d covers economics, politics,\nculture, environment, ideology, and the opposition movement) and edits\nthem to be clear and concise.\n\nThe result is a very good series of books, and I\u2019ve enjoyed them\nimmensely, but it\u2019s not quite what I want. For one thing, the shortness\nof the books (they\u2019re usually about a hundred half-size pages) makes\nthem unfulfilling. It\u2019s impossible to get a real understanding of a big\ntopic in fifty pages, especially when many of them are taken up\nsummarizing related concerns. (Perhaps you could provide a nice overview\nof economic globalization in fifty pages, but covering economic,\npolitical, cultural, environmental, and ideological globalization in\nthat space is absurd.)\n\nAnd the other is that, however great the editors at OUP, it seems\nimpossible that they would be able to commission the best exposition of\nevery topic for one series. Many of the greatest writers are not going\nto accept a particular commission, do not approve of some piece of the\nseries\u2019 style, or perhaps want credit or attention for themselves rather\nthan being just another book in a huge OUP series.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019d like us to put together our own series \u2014 not of very\nshort introductions, but of very good ones. These are books which a) try\nto explain a whole subject with b) clarity and even joy while making c)\nno strong assumptions of prior knowledge and d) not dumbing the subject\ndown. It\u2019s an extremely rare combination \u2014 there are many books on\nsubjects that are good but unreadable by the average person, while\nthere\u2019s a whole industry churning out pop sci pageturners that\ncommunicate little actual knowledge of a subject. But the rare book that\nactually achieves all four of these goals is a true gem, and ought to be\npromoted more widely.\n\nPlease post your suggestions in the comments and I\u2019ll try to assemble a\nlist of them next week.

And unless you?re a white male\nlawyer, you rarely get to vote for someone like yourself in a national\nrace. Nor, in reality, do we have an opportunity to choose policy\npositions: no major candidates support important proposals that most\nvoters agree with, like single-payer health care.\n\nInstead, national elections have been boiled down to simple binary\nchoices, which advertising men and public relations teams reduce to pure\nemotions: Fear. (A bear prowls through the woods.) Hope. (The sun rises\nover a hill.) Vote Smith. Or maybe Jones.\n\nNor does the major media elevate the level of debate. Instead of\nsubstantive discussions about policy proposals and their effects, they\nspend their time on horse-race coverage (who?s raised the most money?\nwho?s polling well in Ohio?) and petty scandals (how much did that\nhaircut cost? was someone somewhere offended by that remark?)\n\nThe result after all this dumbing down? In 2004, voters who said they\nchose a presidential candidate based on the candidate?s agendas, ideas,\nplatforms, or goals comprised a whopping 10% of the electorate. So it?s\nnot too surprising when political scientists find that voters? decisions\ncan be explained by such random factors as whether they like red or\nblue, whether the economy is good or bad, or whether the current party\nhas been in office for long or not.\n\nAside from the occasional telephone poll, the opinions of ?the great\nbody of the society? have been edited out of the picture. Way back in\nFederalist No. 10 (The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against\nDomestic Faction and Insurrection (continued), 1787), Madison put his\nfinger on the reason. ?However small the republic may be,? he noted,\n?the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to\nguard against the cabals of a few.? But similarly, ?however large it may\nbe, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against\nthe confusion of a multitude.?\n\nThe result is that the population grows while the number of\nrepresentatives stays fixed, leaving each politician to represent more\nand more people. The first Congress had a House of 65 members\nrepresenting 40,000 voters and three million citizens (they had a\nwhopping 1.3% voter turnout back then). That?s a representative for\naround every 600 voters or 46,000 citizens (the size of the average\nbaseball stadium). A baseball stadium may be a bit of an unruly mob, but\nit?s not unimaginably large.\n\nToday, by contrast, we have 435 representatives and 300 million\ncitizens?one for roughly every 700,000 citizens. There isn?t a stadium\nin the world big enough to hold that many people. It?s a number more\nakin to a television audience (it?s about how many people tune in to\nwatch Keith Olbermann each night).\n\nWhich is exactly what the modern constituency has become: the TV\naudience following along at home. Even if you wanted to, you can?t have\na real conversation with a TV audience. It is too big to convey a sense\nof what each individual is thinking. Instead of a group to represent,\nit?s a mob to be managed.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI agree with Madison that there is roughly a right size for a group of\nrepresentatives ?on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to\nlie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\nrepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\nand lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\nattached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\nnational objects.?\n\nBut what Madison missed is that there is no similar limit on the number\nof such groups. To take a technological analogy, the Internet is, at\nbottom, an enormous collection of wires. Yet nobody would ever think of\nit this way. Instead, we group the wires into chips and the chips into\ncomputers and the computers into networks and the networks into the\nInternet. And people only deal with things at each level: when the\ncomputer breaks, we can?t identify which wire failed; we take the whole\nthing into the shop.\n\nOne of the most compelling visions for rebooting democracy adopts this\nsystem of abstraction for politics. Parpolity, developed by the\npolitical scientist Stephen Shalom, would build a legislature out of a\nhierarchical series of nested councils. Agreeing with Madison, he says\neach council should be small enough that everyone can engage in\nface-to-face discussion but large enough that there is a diversity of\nopinion and the number of councils is minimized. He estimates the right\nsize is 25 to 50 people.\n\nSo, to begin with, let us imagine a council of you and your 40 closest\nneighbors?perhaps the other people in your apartment building or on your\nblock. You get together every so often to discuss the issues that\nconcern you and your neighborhood. And you may vote to set policy for\nthe area which the council covers.\n\nBut your council has another function: it selects one of its own to send\nas a representative to the next council up. There the process repeats\nitself: the representative from your block and its 40 closest neighbors\nmeet every so often to discuss the political issues that concern the\narea. And, of course, your representative reports back to the group,\ngets your recommendations on difficult questions, and takes suggestions\nfor issues to raise at the next area council meeting.\n\nBy the power of exponents, just five levels of councils, each consisting\nof only fifty people, is enough to cover over three hundred million\npeople. But?and this is the truly clever bit?at the area council the\nwhole process repeats itself. Just as each block council nominates a\nrepresentative to the area council, each area council nominates a\nrepresentative to the city council, and each city council to the state\ncouncil, each state council to the national council, and so on.\n\nShalom discusses a number of further details?provisions for voting,\nrecalls, and delegation?but it?s the idea of nesting that?s key. Under\nsuch a system, there are only four representatives who stand between you\nand the people setting national policy, each of whom is forced to\naccount to their constituents in regular, small face-to-face meetings.\nPoliticians in such a system could not be elected through empty appeals\nto mass emotions. Instead, they would have to sit down, face-to-face,\nwith a council of their peers and persuade them that they are best\nsuited to represent their interests and positions.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere is something rather old-fashioned about this notion of sitting\ndown with one?s fellow citizens and rationally discussing the issues of\nthe day. But there is also something exciting and new about it. In the\nsame way that blogs have given everyone a chance to be a publisher,\nWikipedia lets everyone be an encyclopedia author, and YouTube lets\nanyone be a television producer, Parpolity would let everyone be a\npolitician.\n\nThe Internet has shown us that the pool of people with talent far\noutnumbers the few with the background, connections, and wealth to get\nto a place in society where they can practice their talents\nprofessionally. (It also shows us that many people with those\nconnections aren?t particularly talented.)\n\nThe democratic power of the Net means you don?t need connections to\nsucceed. In a world where kids can be television stars just by finding a\nvideo camera and an Internet connection, citizens may begin to wonder\nwhy getting into politics is so much harder.\n\nFor many years, politicians had a ready excuse: politics was a difficult\njob, which required carefully weighing and evaluating evidence and\nmaking difficult decisions. Only a select few could be trusted to\nperform it; the vast majority of the population was woefully\nunderqualified.\n\nAnd perhaps in the era of a cozy relationship between politicians and\nthe press, this illusion could be sustained. But as netroots activists\nand blogs push our national conversation ever closer to the real world,\nthis excuse is becoming laughable. After all, these men and women of\nsupposedly sober judgment voted overwhelmingly for disasters like the\nIraq War. ?No one could have ever predicted this,? TV?s talking heads\nall insist. No one, that is, except the great body of society, whose\ninsistence that Iraq did not pose a threat and that an occupation would\nbe long and brutal went ignored.\n\nNew online tools for interaction and collaboration have let people come\ntogether across space and time to build amazing things. As the Internet\nbreaks down the last justifications for a professional class of\npoliticians, it also builds up the tools for replacing them. For the\nmost part, their efforts have so far been focused on education and\nentertainment, but it?s only a matter of time before they turn to\npolitics. And when they do, professional politicians beware!\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1334732400.0, "postid": "parpolity", "internal_links": []}, "demotivate": {"post_title": "Aaron\u2019s Patented Demotivational Seminar", "tags": [], "post_content": "Aaron\u2019s Patented Demotivational Seminar\n=======================================\n\nMarch 27, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/demotivate)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThousands of people out there are willing to give you a motivational\nseminar, but only Aaron\u2019s Patented Demotivational Seminars are going to\nactually admit they demotivate you.

In his\nautobiography, *Blinded by the Right*, David Brock describes his\nexperience being recruited for one right out of college: \u201cThough I had\nno advanced degrees, I assumed the grandiose title of John M. Olin\nFellow in Congressional Studies, which, if nothing else, certainly\nimpressed my parents. \u2026 My assignment was to write a monograph, which I\nhoped to publish as a book, challenging the conservative orthodoxy on\nthe proper relationship between the executive and legislative branches\nof government.\u201d This topic was chosen, Brock explains, because with \u201ca\nsquish like Bush in the White House \u2026 the political reality [was] that\nthe conservative agenda could be best advanced by renegade conservatives\non Capitol Hill.\u201d (79f)\n\nNeedless to say, paying fresh-faced former college students lots of\nmoney to write articles that serve political needs is not the best way\nto get accurate information. But is accurate information the goal? Look\nat John Lott, a \u201cresident scholar\u201d at the American Enterprise Institute\n\u2014 the same right-wing think tank that promoted *The Bell Curve*. Lott\u2019s\nbook *More Guns, Less Crime* claimed that his scientific studies had\nfound that passing laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons\nactually lowered crime rates. As usual, the evidence melted away upon\ninvestigation, but Lott\u2019s errors were more serious than most.\n\nNot content to simply distort the data, Lott fabricated an entire study\nwhich he claimed showed that in 97% of cases, simply brandishing a gun\nwould cause an attacker to flee. When Internet critics begun to point\nout his inconsistencies on this claim, Lott posted responses under the\nname \u201cMary Rosh\u201d to defend himself. \u201cI have to say that he was the best\nprofessor I ever had,\u201d Lott gushed about himself one Internet posting.\n\u201cThere were a group of us students who would try to take any class that\nhe taught. Lott finally had to tell us that it was best for us to try\nand take classes from other professors.\u201d\n\nConfronted about his alternate identity, Lott told the *Washington Post*\n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have done it \u2014 I know I shouldn\u2019t have done it\u201d.\nAnd yet, the very next day he again attacked his critics, this time\nunder the new pseudonym \u201cWashingtonian\u201d. (It later got so bad that one\nof Lott\u2019s pseudonyms would start talking about posts from another Lott\npseudonym.)[\u2020](http://timlambert.org/guns/Lott/)\n\nLott, of course, is not the only scholar to make things up to bolster\nhis case. For comparison, look at Michael Bellesiles, author of the\nanti-gun book *Arming America*, which argued guns were uncommon in early\nAmerica. Other scholars investigated and found that Bellesiles had\nprobably fabricated evidence. Emory University, where Bellesiles was a\nprofessor of history, begun an investigation into the accuracy of his\nwork, eventually forcing him to resign. His publisher, Knopf, pulled the\nbook out of print. Libraries pulled the book off their shelves. Columbia\nUniversity revoked the Bancroft Prize the book had been awarded. The\nscandal was widely covered in academic circles. Bellesiles was firmly\ndisgraced and has not shown his face in public since.\n\nAnd what happened to Lott? Nothing. Lott remains a \u201cresident scholar\u201d at\nthe American Enterprise Institute, his book continues to sell well, his\nop-ed pieces are still published in major papers, and he gives talks\naround the country.[\u2020](http://timlambert.org/guns/Lott/) For the\nright-wing scholar, even outright fraud is no serious obstacle.\n\n*Next:* [Part 5: Saving Business](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5)\n", "external_links": ["http://timlambert.org/guns/Lott/", "http://timlambert.org/guns/Lott/"], "time": 1149836400.0, "postid": "shifting4", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5"]}, "shifting7": {"post_title": "Fighting Back: Responses to the Mainstream Media", "tags": [], "post_content": "Fighting Back: Responses to the Mainstream Media\n================================================\n\nJune 15, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting7)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*[This is part 7 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks.\nSee also [part one](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1), [part\ntwo](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2), [part\nthree](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3), [part\nfour](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4), [part\nfive](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5), and [part\nsix](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting6).]*\n\nUnlike the conservative media, it does not appear the national media is\nintentionally partisan. But it exists in a very specific structural\ncontext. A recent study found that two-thirds of journalists thought\nbottom-line pressure was \u201cseriously hurting the quality of news\ncoverage\u201d while around half reported their newsrooms had been cut. 75%\nof print and 85% of broadcast journalists agreed that \u201ctoo little\nattention is paid to complex\nissues.\u201d[\u2020](http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/214topline.pdf) When\nyou\u2019re short on staff and stories are shallow, reporters become even\nmore dependent on outside sources \u2014 and the right-wing think tanks are\nmore than willing to help out, while further pulling coverage to the\nright.\n\nBut one obvious solution \u2014 creating a matching set of left-wing think\ntanks \u2014 while perhaps helpful in balancing the debate, will not solve\nthe problem. Media norms of balance mean that even qualified experts\nwill always be presented as \u201cjust one side of the story,\u201d balanced\ndirectly against inaccurate conservatives \u2014 recall how the handful of\ncorporate-funded global warming deniers are still balanced against the\noverwhelming scientific consensus.\n\nIdeally, viewers would be able to hear both perspectives and decide\nwhich they thought was accurate. But since, as the journalists conceded,\nso little time is spent explaining complex issues, in practice very\nlittle information is presented that can help the viewer decide who\u2019s\ncorrect. So they\u2019re left to decide based on their existing ideological\npreferences, further splitting the country into two alternate realities.\n\nFiguring out what is true \u2014 especially when it\u2019s so obvious, as in the\nexamples above \u2014 is precisely what the mainstream media should be doing.\nPartisan pundits would be replaced with thoughtful scholars.\nNon-peer-reviewed books would be ignored, not endlessly promoted.\nScientific facts would be given precedence over political arguments.\nPolitical commentary would be replaced by factual education.\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath. Six major companies own nearly 90% of all media\noutlets.[\u2020](http://www.thevoicenews.com/news/2003/0411/Front_Page/C06_LaVoie-media.html)\nAnd they \u2014 and their advertisers \u2014 don\u2019t mind how things are going.\nSumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom (Paramount, CBS, Blockbuster, MTV, Comedy\nCentral, etc.), told a group of CEOs that \u201cI look at the election from\nwhat\u2019s good for Viacom. I vote for what\u2019s good for Viacom.\u201d And, \u201cfrom a\nViacom standpoint, the election of a Republican administration is a\nbetter deal. Because the Republican administration has stood for many\nthings we believe in, deregulation and so\non.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005669) Better news\nreporting wouldn\u2019t just be more expensive, it would threaten these\nbusiness interests.\n\nTo get the straight story, it\u2019s necessary to turn to independent and\ncommunity sources which don\u2019t have such conflicts of interest. One\npossibility is the daily news show *Democracy Now!*, hosted by Amy\nGoodman, which is funded only by viewers and foundations. Broadcast on\n150 radio stations, 150 television stations, and the Internet, the show\npresents stories from activists, journalists, authors, and public\ninterest organizations from around the world.\n\nWhen outlets from ABC to the *New York Times* began claiming Iraq had\nweapons of mass destruction, *Democracy Now!* was one of the few sources\nto take a contrary view. It presented the testimony of Iraq\u2019s top\nweapons official, who defected to the US and explained that all the\nweapons had been destroyed. (Other stations, ironically, parroted the\nBush administration in promoting the information he presented about the\nweapons Iraq *had*, without mentioning they had been\ndestroyed.)[\u2020](http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/07/0320205)\n\nAnd when US soldiers kidnapped Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the\ndemocratically-elected president of Haiti, and flew him to the Central\nAfrican Republic where they locked him in a hotel room, he managed to\nquietly phone out while armed guards stood outside his door. *Democracy\nNow!* was alone in airing his incredible story. When Aristide was\nfinally freed, he insisted on returning to his country and again Amy\nGoodman was the only US television journalist who dared to accompany him\nback.[\u2020](http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/01/1521216&mode=thread&tid=25)\n\nStill, *Democracy Now!*\u2019s audience is rather small compared to that of\nthe mainstream media. But stories from overseas hint at what could\nhappen if enough people begun paying attention to such sources. In South\nKorea, the country with the highest rate of broadband adoption, politics\nhas been turned upside down by OhmyNews, a five-year-old website.\nFounded by Oh Yeon Ho, OhymyNews has a feature unlike any other paper:\nmore than 85% of its stories are contributed by\nreaders.[\u2020](http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/5889390.htm)\n\nAlmost anyone can write for OhmyNews: the site posts 70% of all stories\nthat are submitted, over 15,000 citizen-reporters have published\nstories. OhmyNews copyedits their work but tries to leave their\ndiffering styles intact. The citizen-reporters write about things they\nknow about and that interest them, together they end up covering most of\nthe traditional spectrum. Yet their new voices end up providing coverage\non things which typically get ignored by the mainstream\nmedia.[\u2020](http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=8&no=201599&rel_no=1)\n\nThis is most evident in their political coverage. Before OhmyNews,\nconservatives controlled 80% of Korea\u2019s newspaper circulation. Then\nOhmyNews gave a voice to progressives, inspiring massive nationwide\nprotests against the government. The protests, in turn, led to the\nelection of reformist Roh Moo Hyun, now known as \u201cthe first Internet\npresident.\u201d[\u2020](http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=8&no=201599&rel_no=1)\nThe furious conservative National Assembly responded by voting to\nimpeach Roh on technical grounds. OhmyNews readers again organized and\noverthrew the Assembly in the next election, reinstating Roh. There\u2019s no\nreason why what happened in South Korea can\u2019t happen here. Overcoming\nthe tide of misinformation is hard work, but working together committed\ncitizens can make amazing progress, even when up against the most\npowerful interests. Out society has an extraordinary level of freedom\nand openness. Whether we use that freedom to seek out the truth or\nremain content with conventional platitudes is up to us.\n\n*Note to readers:* Citations have been added to the previous articles in\nthe series.\n", "external_links": ["http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/214topline.pdf", "http://www.thevoicenews.com/news/2003/0411/Front_Page/C06_LaVoie-media.html", "http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005669", "http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/07/0320205", "http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/01/1521216&mode=thread&tid=25", "http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/5889390.htm", "http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=8&no=201599&rel_no=1", "http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=8&no=201599&rel_no=1"], "time": 1150354800.0, "postid": "shifting7", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting6"]}, "shifting6": {"post_title": "Hurting Seniors: The Attack on Social Security", "tags": [], "post_content": "Hurting Seniors: The Attack on Social Security\n==============================================\n\nJune 11, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting6)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*[This is part 6 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks.\nSee also [part one](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1), [part\ntwo](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2), [part\nthree](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3), [part\nfour](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4), and [part\nfive](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5).]*\n\nRecent events provide a compelling case study of how this process works.\nConservatives have wanted to get rid of Social Security for years. The\nmost successful anti-poverty program in history, it clearly shows how\nthe government can be used to help people \u2014 anathema to conservative\nideology. Now, with a secure lock on government, is their time to\nstrike. As a White House deputy wrote in a memo that was later leaked,\n\u201cFor the first time in six decades, the Social Security battle is one we\ncan win \u2014 and in doing so, we can help transform the political and\nphilosophical landscape of the\ncountry.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000119.html)\n\nThere\u2019s extremely strong public support for Social Security \u2014\nconservatives could certainly never just come out and say they wanted to\nend it \u2014 so their plan is to deceive the public: First, persuade people\nthat Social Security is facing some sort of crisis and won\u2019t be around\nfor the next generation. Second, convince them to begin replacing Social\nSecurity with a privatized version. Privatization, the logic goes, will\nnaturally keep increasing until all of Social Security is eliminated.\nThe only problem is that Social Security isn\u2019t facing a crisis and any\nform of privatization, which would require both paying out to existing\nretirees and saving away money for the private accounts of the current\ngeneration, would worsen whatever financial problems Social Security\ndoes have.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/activism/cbs-cnn-social-security.html)\n\nBut think tanks have been preparing for this moment for years, floating\nprivatization plans and doing their best to persuade the media that\nSocial Security was in imminent danger. So when the Bush administration\nstarted up their anti-Social Security campaign, the media knew exactly\nwhat to say.\n\nCBS, for example, presented a segment featuring man-on-the-street Tad\nDeHaven. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to get anything from Social Security, OK?\u201d said\nyoung DeHaven. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be there\u2014that\u2019s my assumption.\u201d\nDeHaven had good reason to say these things: for years, he\u2019s been one of\nthe leading Republican activists in the fight to get rid of Social\nSecurity. CBS never mentioned the\nconnection.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/activism/cbs-cnn-social-security.html)\n\nA later CBS report boosted fears that Social Security was going bankrupt\nby displaying a graphic on the screen that read \u201c2042: Insolvent = 0\nbenefits??\u201d [*sic*] (\u201cIn 2042, Social Security will become insolvent,\nand today\u2019s young workers risk losing their benefits,\u201d a voiceover\nexplained.) But this just isn\u2019t true: even the pessimistic Social\nSecurity Administration concedes that by 2042 Social Security will be\nable to pay nearly 80% of scheduled benefits, which is still far more\nthan what it pays out\ntoday.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/activism/cbs-social-security-update.html)\n\nOther networks were no better. NBC\u2019s report feature quotes from Bush\nsaying the system would go \u201cflat bust\u201d and an interview with a Heritage\nFoundation scholar \u2014 identified only as a \u201csocial security expert\u201d \u2014 but\nallowed no critics to contradict their\nclaims.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/activism/nbc-socialsecurity.html)\nMeanwhile, an ABC report claimed \u201cOne thing everyone agrees on, the\nSocial Security system as it exists now won\u2019t be able to afford those\npayments for long after the Wilsons retire.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s quite the\nopposite: even the most pessimistic predictions say that Social Security\nwill be fine until the Wilsons are statistically dead.

We\nneeded to learn the truth, Malkin insisted, so that we could see how\nracial profiling was similarly justified to fight the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d\n\nBainbridge Island was the center of the evacuations; to this day,\nresidents still feel ashamed and teach students a special unit about the\nincident, entitled \u201cLeaving Our Island\u201d. But one parent in the district,\nMary Dombrowski, was persuaded by Malkin\u2019s book that the evacuation was\nactually justified and insisted the school was teaching a one-sided\nversion of the internment story, \u201cpropaganda\u201d that forced impressionable\nchildren into thinking that the concentration camps were a mistake.\n\nThe school\u2019s principal defended the practice. As the *Seattle Times*\nreported:\n\n> \u201cWe do teach it as a mistake,\u201d she said, noting that the U.S.\n> government has admitted it was wrong. \u201cAs an educator, there are some\n> things that we can say aren\u2019t debatable anymore.\u201d Slavery, for\n> example. Or the internment \u2014 as opposed to a subject such as global\n> warming, she\n> said.[\u2020](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002027639_bainbridge06m.html)\n\nTrue, Japanese internment isn\u2019t a controversial issue like global\nwarming, but ten years ago, global warming wasn\u2019t a controversial issue\neither. In 1995, the UN\u2019s panel on international climate change released\nits consensus report, finding that global warming was a real and serious\nissue that had to be quickly confronted. The media covered the\nscientists\u2019 research and the population agreed, leading President\nClinton to say he would sign an international treaty to stop global\nwarming.\n\nThen came the backlash. The Global Climate Coalition (funded by over 40\nmajor corporate groups like Amoco, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and\nGeneral Motors) began spending millions of dollars each year to derail\nthe Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to help reduce global\nwarming. They held conferences entitled \u201cThe Costs of Kyoto,\u201d issued\npress releases and faxes dismissing the scientific evidence for global\nwarming, and spent more than \\$3 million on newspaper and television ads\nclaiming Kyoto would mean a \u201c50-cent-per-gallon gasoline\ntax.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1997Q4/warming.html)\n\nThe media, in response to flurries of \u201cblast faxes\u201d (a technique in\nwhich a press release is simultaneously faxed to thousands of\njournalists) and accusations of left-wing bias, began backing off from\nthe scientific\nevidence.[\u2020](http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1997Q4/warming.html) A\nrecent study found only 35% of newspaper stories on global warming\naccurately described the scientific consensus, with the majority\nimplying that scientists who believed in global warming were just as\ncommon as global warming deniers (of which there were only a tiny\nhandful, almost all of whom had received funding from energy companies\nor associated groups).[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1978)\n\nIt all had an incredible effect on the public. In 1993, 88% of Americans\nthought global warming was a serious problem. By 1997, that number had\nfallen to 42%, with only 28% saying immediate action was necessary.\n^[1](#fn:1)^ And so Clinton changed course and insisted that cutting\nemissions should be put off for 20 years.\n\nUS businesses seriously weakened the Kyoto Protocol, leading it to\nrequire only a 7% reduction in emissions (compared to the 20% requested\nby European nations) and then President Bush refused to sign on to even\nthat.[\u2020](http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1997Q4/warming.html) In four\nshort years, big business had managed to turn nearly half the country\naround and halt the efforts to protect the planet.\n\nAnd now, the principal on Bainbridge Island, like most people, thinks\nglobal warming is a hotly contested issue \u2014 the paradigmatic example of\na hotly contested issue \u2014 even when the science is clear. (\u201cThere\u2019s no\nbetter scientific consensus on this on any issue I know,\u201d said the head\nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \u201cexcept maybe\nNewton\u2019s second law of dynamics.\u201d)^[2](#fn:2)^ But all this debate about\nproblems has kept us away from talk about solutions. As journalist Ross\nGelbspan puts it, \u201cBy keeping the discussion focused on whether there is\na problem in the first place, they have effectively silenced the debate\nover what to do about it.\u201d[\u2020](http://dieoff.org/page82.htm) So is it any\nwonder that conservatives want to do the same thing again?

Written by Charles Murray,\nwho received over 1.2 million from right-wing foundations for his work,\nthe book claimed that IQ tests revealed black people to be genetically\nless intelligent than whites, thus explaining their low place in\nsociety. Murray published the 845-page book without showing it to any\nother scientists, leading the *Wall Street Journal* to say he pursued \u201ca\nstrategy that provided book galleys to likely supporters while\nwithholding them from likely critics\u201d in an attempt \u201cto fix the fight \u2026\ncontrary to usual publishing protocol.\u201d Murray\u2019s think tank, the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute, flew key members of the media to\nWashington for a weekend of briefings on the book\u2019s content. (*What\nLiberal Media?*, 94)\n\nAnd the media lapped it up. In what Eric Alterman has termed \u201ca kind of\nRorschach test for pundits,\u201d (*WLM?*, 96) every major media outlet\nreviewed the book without questioning the accuracy of its contents.\nInstead, they merely quibbled about its proposed recommendations that\nthe dumb blacks, with their dangerously high reproductive rates, might\nhave to be kept in \u201ca high-tech and more lavish version of an Indian\nreservation\u201d without such luxuries as \u201cindividualism, equal rights\nbefore the law,\u201d and so on. Reviewers proposed more moderate solutions,\nlike just taking away their welfare checks. (*WLM?*, 94)\n\nBut such quibbles aside, the amount of coverage alone was incredible.\nThe book received cover stories in *Newsweek* (\u201cthe science behind [it]\nis overwhelmingly mainstream\u201d), *The New Republic* (which dedicated an\nentire issue to discussion of the book), and *The New York Times Book\nReview* (which suggested critics disliked its \u201cappeal to sweet reason\u201d\nand are \u201cinclined to hang the defendants without a trial\u201d). Detailed\narticles appeared in *TIME*, *The New York Times* (\u201cmakes a strong\ncase\u201d), *The New York Times Magazine*, *Forbes* (praising the book\u2019s\n\u201cJeffersonian vision\u201d), the *Wall Street Journal*, and the *National\nReview*. It received a respectful airing on such shows as ABC\u2019s\n*Nightline*, PBS\u2019s *MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour*, the *McLaughlin Group*,\n*Think Tank* (which dedicated a special two-part series to the book),\nABC\u2019s *PrimeTime Live*, and NPR\u2019s *All Things Considered*. With fifteen\nweeks on the bestseller list, it ended up selling over 300,000 copies in\nhardcover.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271)\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a media debate about the existence of global warming or\nthe merits of internment, this was a full-on media endorsement of\nracism, which the *American Heritage Dictionary* defines as \u201cThe belief\nthat race accounts for differences in human character or ability and\nthat a particular race is superior to others.\u201d Nor did the media mention\nthe work\u2019s political intentions. On the contrary, they presented it as\nthe sober work of social scientists: *Nightline*\u2019s Ted Koppel lamented\nto Murray about how his \u201cgreat deal of work and research\u201d had become \u201ca\npolitical football\u201d.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271)\n\nOf course, this was almost certainly Murray\u2019s intention all along. In\nthe book proposal for his previous book (*Losing Ground*, an attack on\ngovernment welfare programs) he had explained: \u201cWhy can a publisher sell\nthis book? Because a huge number of well-meaning whites fear that they\nare closet racists, and this book tells them they are not. It\u2019s going to\nmake them feel better about things they already think but do not know\nhow to say.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271) That\u2019s\ncertainly what *The Bell Curve* did, replacing a debate over how to\nimprove black achievement with one about whether such improvement was\neven possible.\n\nThere was just one problem: none of this stuff was accurate. As\nProfessor Michael Nunley wrote in a special issue of the *American\nBehavioral Scientist* on *The Bell Curve*, after a series of scientific\narticles debunked all the book\u2019s major claims: \u201cI believe this book is a\nfraud, that its authors must have known it was a fraud when they were\nwriting it, and that Charles Murray must still know it\u2019s a fraud as he\ngoes around defending it. \u2026 After careful reading, I cannot believe its\nauthors were not acutely aware of \u2026 how they were distorting the\nmaterial they did include.\u201d (*WLM?*, 100)\n\n*Next:* [Part 4: Spreading Lies](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4)\n", "external_links": ["http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271", "http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271", "http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271"], "time": 1149750000.0, "postid": "shifting3", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4"]}, "shifting2": {"post_title": "Making Noise: How Right-Wing Think Tanks Get the Word Out", "tags": [], "post_content": "Making Noise: How Right-Wing Think Tanks Get the Word Out\n=========================================================\n\nJune 7, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*[This is part 2 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks.\nSee [part one](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1).]*\n\nMalkin\u2019s book on internment was no more accurate than the corporate\nmisinformation about global warming. Historians quickly showed the book\nbadly distorted the government records and secret cables it purported to\ndescribe. As just one example, Malkin writes that a Japanese message\nstated they \u201chad [Japanese] spies in the U.S. Army\u201d when it actually\nsaid they hoped to recruit spies in the\narmy.[\u2020](http://hnn.us/articles/7092.html) But it should be no big\nsurprise that Malkin, who is, after all, an editorialist and not a\nhistorian, didn\u2019t manage to fully understand the complex documentary\nrecord in the year she spent writing the book\npart-time.[\u2020](http://www.isthatlegal.org/Muller_and_Robinson_on_Malkin.html)\n\nMalkin\u2019s motives, as a right-wing activist and proponent of racial\nprofiling, are fairly obvious. But how did Mary Dombrowski, the\nBainbridge Island parent, get caught up in this latest attempt to\nrewrite history? Opinions on global warming were changed because big\nbusiness could afford to spent millions to change people\u2019s minds. But\nracial profiling seems like less of a moneymaker. Who invested in\nspreading that message?\n\nThe first step is getting the information out there. Dombrowski probably\nheard about Malkin\u2019s book from the Fox News Channel, where it was\nceaselessly promoted for days, and where Malkin is a contributor. Or\nmaybe she heard about it on MSNBC\u2019s *Scarborough Country*, a show hosted\nby a former Republican congressman, which had Malkin as a guest. Or\nmaybe she heard it while driving and listening to FOX host Sean\nHannity\u2019s radio show, or maybe Rush Limbaugh\u2019s. Or maybe she read a\nreview in the *New York Post* (which, like Fox News, is owned by Rupert\nMurdoch). Or maybe she read about it on a right-wing website or weblog,\nlike Townhall.com, which publishes 10 new conservative op-ed columns\nevery day.\n\nAll of these organizations are partisan conservative outlets.\nTownhall.com, for example, is published by the Heritage Foundation, a\nright-wing Washington, D.C. think tank. Most people imagine a think tank\nas a place where smart people think big thoughts, coming up with new\nideas for the government to use. But that\u2019s not how Heritage works.\nNearly half of Heritage\u2019s \\$30 million budget is spent on publicity, not\nresearch.[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/extra/9607/heritage.html) Every day,\nthey take work like Malkin\u2019s that agrees with their ideological\nprejudices and push it out through the right-wing media described above\n(Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, *New York Post*) and into the mainstream media\n(ABC, NPR, *New York Times*, *Seattle Times*).\n\nThey use a variety of tactics. Heritage, for example, publishes an\nannual telephone directory featuring thousands of conservative experts\nand associated policy organizations. (*The Right Nation*, 161) And if\nlooking up somebody is too much work, Heritage maintains a 24-hour\nhotline for the media, providing quotes promoting conservative ideology\non any subject. Heritage\u2019s \u201cinformation marketing\u201d department makes\npackages of colored index cards with pre-printed talking points for any\nconservative who plans to do an interview. (*The Right Nation*, 167) And\nHeritage computers are stocked with the names of over 3,500 journalists,\norganized by specialty, who Heritage staffers personally call to make\nsure they have all the latest conservative misinformation. Every\nHeritage study is turned into a two-page summary which is then turned\ninto an op-ed piece which is then distributed to newspapers through the\nHeritage Features Syndicate. (*What Liberal Media?*, 83)\n\nIt all adds up: a 2003 study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, the\nmedia watch group, found conservative think tanks were cited nearly\n14,000 times in major newspapers, television, and radio shows. (By\ncomparison, liberal think tanks were cited only 4,000 times that\nyear.)[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/extra/0405/think-tank.html) That means\n10,000 additional quotes of right-wing ideology, misleading statistics,\ndistorted facts, and so on. There\u2019s no way that doesn\u2019t unfairly skew\nthe public debate.\n\n*Next:* [Part 3: Endorsing Racism](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3)\n", "external_links": ["http://hnn.us/articles/7092.html", "http://www.isthatlegal.org/Muller_and_Robinson_on_Malkin.html", "http://www.fair.org/extra/9607/heritage.html", "http://www.fair.org/extra/0405/think-tank.html"], "time": 1149663600.0, "postid": "shifting2", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3"]}, "fearandbio": {"post_title": "Fear and Loathing in Biotechnology Firms", "tags": [], "post_content": "Fear and Loathing in Biotechnology Firms\n========================================\n\nJuly 10, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fearandbio)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI was sitting with my journalist and reading *Fear and Loathing* when I\nnoticed that things weren\u2019t seeming the way I\u2019d become accustomed to\nthem seeming. For one thing, my journalist\u2019s nose seemed a fair sight\nbigger than one would expect a nose to be, even accounting for taste,\nwhile her eyes seemed to be moving back and forth in her head as if they\nweren\u2019t quite sure whether they preferred it in or out.\n\nStill, I shouldn\u2019t criticize. I suspect I didn\u2019t look my usual self\neither, what with my head making those small wobbly notions on my neck\nand my leg vibrating back and forth as if it were thinking very hard\nabout something. Why it was forced to work as my leg, supporting me all\nthe time while i gave it no consideration in return, perhaps.\n\nAs I finished the book I slammed it down on the desk, causing a couple\nother books to fall off the side. \u201cWe must rent a very fast car,\u201d I\ndemanded, before scrunching up my face in an inevitably doomed attempt\nto get a look at myself. I didn\u2019t normally sound like this.\n\nMy journalist agreed, so we popped some pills and picked up a BMW. It\nwas a little past midnight at the time, so you could hardly notice the\ncar\u2019s nasty habit of accelerating right up to the edge of other cars,\nstopping hard a couple inches before it hit them.\n\n\u201cWe must find a heart of darkness,\u201d said my journalist. I just looked at\nher. She continued mumbling about a heart of darkness while stepping on\nthe accelerator. I decided to look away. She continued to make friends\nwith the accelerator. \u201cI\u2019ve got it\u2014\u201d she shouted, wrenching the car\naround, \u201cVacaville!\u201d\n\nMy journalist assured me that Vacaville was a small city outside San\nFrancisco filled with giant vats of transgenic mutant corn that cured\ncancer. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what any of that really was, let alone which\npart of that was a heart of darkness. My fears were not allayed when we\npulled off the freeway under a giant light-up sign that said \u201cAuthentic\nHistoric Vacaville\u201d, only to see a couple 7-11s and a CostCo. We got\nback on the freeway.\n\nThe next time we got off the freeway, there were a dozen industrial\nbuildings with sinister yellow lighting belching vast plumes of smoke\ninto the air. We ditched the car behind a tree, dropped our wallets and\nidentification in it, and, arm-in-arm, begun strolling through a place\nwhich had even less claim to the title of Authentic Historic Vacaville.\n\nIn 2006, the leading biotechnology firm Genentech was named the number\none \u201cBest Company To Work For\u201d by *Fortune Magazine*. I suppose this\nincredible allure could explain why the company\u2019s campus was surrounded\nby barbed wire. It did not, however, explain why the barbed wire was\nfacing *in*.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to get into the Genentech campus. You can\nclimb the barbed wire fence. You can swipe an ID badge and go through\nthe imposing metal turnstiles. You can drive past the guard at the main\ngate and show some kind of ID. Or you can find the side gate that they\nforgot to lock and open it. My journalist didn\u2019t want to scratch her\npants, so we used the side gate.\n\nAnd that was how we found ourselves strolling in the moonlight around\nthe factories of a leading biotechnology firm.\n\n\u201cThis place is incredible,\u201d my journalist said, as we approached it.\n\u201cConstruction worker,\u201d I said, as I spotted a man walking through the\ncorridors of the empty new building. We continued walking around it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always morally torn by major biotech companies,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cSmoke break,\u201d I said, as the construction worker stepped outside the\nbuilding and paused.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, this place makes drugs that save people\u2019s lives \u2014\ntreatments for cancers and cystic fibrosis and asthma,\u201d she told me.\n\u201cHeading out,\u201d I told her, as the construction worker walked across the\ncampus towards the gate.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, on the other hand, this place is pure evil.\u201d We walked past\nlarge vats labeled \u201cPoison\u201d and huge machines that looked like they\ncould crush us. Smoke belched from the top of the building and we could\nsee more buildings and a parking lot in the distance.\n\n\u201cCompanies like this are made up of dozens of people, each of whom,\nindividually, are the sweetest guys. Nice, friendly people who just care\nabout doing well at their work.\u201d As we approached the buildings, we saw\nthat even now \u2014 2AM \u2014 the place was alive. New cars were pulling into\nthe lot and men and women were walking from building to building. The\nyellowed light on their white lab coats gave the whole thing a sinister\nair.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, together, they manage to pull off the most incomprehensible\nevils.\u201d I was about to join her discussion of organizational sociology\nwhen I heard a go-kart pull up behind us.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the man in the go-kart. \u201cDo you folks work here?\u201d\n\nI was about to come up with some explanation but my journalist dodged in\nfront of me and saved me the trouble.\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, with complete sincerity.\n\n\u201cDo you have visitors\u2019 badges?\u201d asked the man, sounding a bit puzzled.\n\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAre you supposed to be here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way. Actually, we were just going for a stroll when we found\nourselves in this bizarre place. We were wondering if you could tell us\nhow to get out.\u201d\n\nThe man in the go-kart thought about this for a while before getting out\nof the kart and walking towards us. As he stepped into the light I could\nsee he was wearing a bright orange vest.\n\n\u201cHuh, well the fastest way to get out of the facility from here is\nprobably to walk through the entire campus,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said the journalist. \u201cWell, could you escort us off the\npremises then?\u201d she asked. I restrained myself from kicking her.\n\nThe man in the vest looked back at the go-kart, where his partner was\nsitting. \u201cNah, my there\u2019s no more room in the kart,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, well then maybe you could take us to security?\u201d she said. I dug a\nsmall hole in the ground, placed my foot into it, then used the other\nfoot to fill it back up with dirt in a vain attempt to stop myself from\nkicking her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually not allowed to take you guys to Genentech security,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSee, I\u2019m over with construction. One of my men came by and told\nme that he saw to people walking around the premises, so I just came to\ncheck it out.\u201d He thought about this for a while. \u201cLet me see if I can\nfind you someone,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that is how we got a burly man in a bright orange vest to escort us\nonto the Genetech campus, a series of industrial buildings facing a\nshared quadrangle of matted grass, with some concrete sidewalks laid\nacross it. The whole thing looked a bit like a college campus, I\nsuppose, if the college\u2019s buildings had been designed to look like some\nkind of sci-fi bubble city. Through the windows one could spy huge\nmachines with many levers dials and large vats that stuff was being\noozed into and out of.\n\nPeople entered and exited the buildings in a hurried manner, and one\nscientist, a frazzled-looking man with a redhead\u2019s beard and an orange\nt-shirt reading \u201cgot juice?\u201d, crossed the path in front of us.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the man in the vest, his manly striding posture\nsuddenly becoming bowed and deferential before the frazzled scientist.\n\u201cI found these people who got lost wandering around the campus,\u201d he\nexplained, as if it was a question. \u201cDo you think you could try to get\nthem home?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sure!\u201d said the scientist, genial and alive as a carnival barker,\nas if he made a habit of wandering around the Genentech campus at 2 in\nthe morning looking for people to take back to their cars.\n\n\u201cThanks so much,\u201d said the man in the vest, before scurrying back to his\ngo-kart.\n\nThe scientist reached for a walkie-talkie from his back pocket.\n\u201cSecurity, are you there? Security?\u201d he said and paused. The radio\ncrackled. \u201cThis is security,\u201d it finally replied. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he\nasked. There was a pause. Then a crackle. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you in your office?\u201d Pause, crackle. \u201cUm, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, be there in a bit.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how a Genentech scientist badged us into the facility and\nbegun taking us through its corridors.\n\n\u201cSo what do you do here?\u201d I asked, as if making conversation.\n\n\u201cOh, we, um, make drugs to treat breast cancer,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d my journalist whispered in my ear. \u201cAwful big facility\njust for treating breast cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, I\u2019m a scientist here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, really? A scientist? Heh, I always imagined scientists wandering\naround in big white labcoats carrying beakers,\u201d I joked. \u201cOh, we do,\u201d he\nsaid with utter sincerity. \u201cActually, I just took my lab coat off \u2014 if\nyou guys had been here a couple minutes earlier I would have been\nwearing it.\u201d\n\nWe wandered past hallways labeled with Genentech propaganda and stopped\nright before the company cafeteria, ducking into a door to find the desk\nfor security.\n\n\u201cHey there!\u201d said the scientist. \u201cHi,\u201d said the bored-looking\nAfrican-American woman behind the desk.\n\n\u201cUm, these two folks got a bit lost wandering around the neighborhood\nand I was wondering you could help get them out of here.\u201d\n\nThe security woman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou brought\nrandom strangers in here? They can\u2019t be in here! You can\u2019t just bring\npeople in here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I just figured I ought to take them to security and you guys\ncould help them out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp them out? Help them out? I\u2019m not allowed to leave this desk,\u201d she\ncried. \u201cOh, they can\u2019t be in here. You gotta get rid of these guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said the scientist, completely unfazed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll walk\nthem back to their car.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cYou just do what you gotta do,\n\u2018cause they can\u2019t be in here.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how a Genentech scientist took us through the building,\npast offices, through the loading dock, out the back past more\nindustrial equipment, a running commentary all the way.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you guys get in here?\u201d asked the guard at the gate as we walked\npast him. He\u2019d obviously heard about us. \u201cOh,\u201d my journalist said, \u201cit\nwas open. We just walked in.\u201d The guard just laughed and waved.\n\nThe scientist asked where we were from, just in the spirit of making\nconversation. My journalist explained that we were from San Francisco\nand we\u2019d decided it was a nice night for a casual stroll, so we had been\nwalking around Vacaville. The scientist nodded approvingly, as if he\nalways ran into cityfolk who came out for a stroll around Vacaville\u2019s\noffice parks at 2 in the morning.\n\nSoon we\u2019d located our car and said our goodbyes. The scientist waved\ngoodbye at us and we tried to stifle our giggles until we got back to\nthe car.\n\nAt moments like these, which seem to stand outside of space and time \u2014\nmiddle of nowhere, middle of the night \u2014 one thing remains constant:\nDenny\u2019s. Always open, with decor that hasn\u2019t changed since its founding\nin the 1960s, a diner like Denny\u2019s is a perfect place to go to make\nsense of it all. But none of it makes any sense at all; there is nothing\nto do but lay your head down on the table and puzzle at a world that is\nmore strange than you can possibly imagine.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1184050800.0, "postid": "fearandbio", "internal_links": []}, "happynewyear": {"post_title": "Happy New Year", "tags": ["personal"], "post_content": "Happy New Year\n==============\n\nJanuary 2, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/happynewyear)\n\n* * * * *\n\nNobody seems to have noticed, but over the past couple months, this blog\nhas been publishing a record post a day.

I\nwrote most of the blog posts in about an hour and while they\u2019re decent\nfor something written at that rate, they can rarely be called great.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s time to slow down, work more on crafting my prose, maybe\nwrite for magazines and other outlets.

Everyone was quiet. Condi asked a few\ntechnical questions and then finally Karl Rove spoke up. \u201cWell, that\u2019s\njust until we start throwing our weight around over there,\u201d he said.\n\nHockenberry was stunned and thought they should do a piece on what this\nrevealed into the mentality of the war\u2019s planners. But NBC News didn\u2019t\nthink this was a very good idea. America wanted the war to happen; their\njob was just to wait and see how it turned out. \u201cWe\u2019re not particularly\ninterested in the story,\u201d Hockenberry explains. \u201cWe\u2019re a process that\u2019s\ntrying to maintain people in front of the set, so in a certain sense\nmedia at that point was doing its own kind of shock-and-awe that went\nright along with the war\u2019s shock-and-awe [because] the business is just\nto grab eyeballs.\u201d\n\nLater, his team edited together a montage of clips about what it was\nlike for reporters who were still in Iraq to experience the\nshock-and-awe campaign.

Food per person was at an all-time high \u2014 it was a\npeak year in rice output and availability. It was also a peak year for\nstarvation. 100,000 people starved to death, their skin cracking and\ntheir tissues breaking down. They were unable even to focus their eyes\nas the world watched on TV. Another million and a half died from\nstarvation\u2019s secondary effects. Another half-a-million died after the\nfamine was over because their bodies had been made so weak. There was\nplenty of food to feed them. They starved because they were too poor to\nafford it.\n\nPoor people die because they can\u2019t get food, because they can\u2019t get\nshelter, because they can\u2019t get health care, because they can\u2019t get\nhomes in places that aren\u2019t polluted, because they can\u2019t get food\nwithout toxins, because they can\u2019t get time off to supervise their kids,\nbecause they can\u2019t spend money on safety, because they can\u2019t spend money\non education, because they can\u2019t get a vacation from the stress that\u2019s\nliterally eating away at their brain. We don\u2019t even know all the reasons\npoor people die. But we do know that they do.\n\nIt\u2019s not polite to talk about that. We talk about the poverty rate or\nthe poverty level or the poverty gap, not kids catching on fire and\nadults wasting away. We talk about economic development and markets and\neducation, not the millions who die each year coughing blood as\ntuberculosis takes over their body. (They don\u2019t die from tuberculosis.\nThey die because they can\u2019t afford the vaccine.)\n\nEben Kenah wants to change that. His thesis, \u201c[Poverty and the English\nLanguage](http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidstudents/thesis_prize/thesis_2001/kenah_thesis.pdf)\u201d\n[PDF], is the best thing I\u2019ve read in a very long while. Quite\nliterally, it\u2019s changed the way I look at what\u2019s important in the world.\nHe argues that the right way to think about poverty isn\u2019t in terms of\nGDP or income or education or literacy, but in terms of death. That we\nshould measure poverty by measuring who it kills. \u201cIt is easier to\nbelieve that poverty causes people to wear old clothes, live in small\nhouses, or forego owning a television than it is to admit that people on\nthe bottom of the socioeconomic ladder often die early as a result,\u201d he\nwrites.\n\nA black man in Harlem is 4.11 times as likely to die in a given year as\nthe average American male. A poor white in Detroit is twice as likely.\nPoor people are more likely to die than rich people, lower-class people\nthan upper-class people, unemployed than employed, blacks than whites.\n\nMortality resolves a number of long-standing technical debates about the\nright way to measure poverty. In the US we calculate poverty by having\nexperts at the Department of Agriculture figure out the cheapest\nproducts on sale in America that could meet minimal nutritional\nrequirements. They add up how much they cost and multiply by three.\nPeople with less than that are defined as poor. Can the poor really\nfollow that minimal diet in practice? How do you even decide what\nminimal nutritional requirements are? Why three? The answer is simple:\njust count deaths instead.\n\nBut thinking about things this way provokes broader, more fundamental\nquestions, even broader than the issue of global poverty. It makes us\nask: Why do people die? And how can we stop it?\n\nThe rich worry about this all the time. Vast sums are spent on their\nhealth care. There\u2019s a whole industry in improving traffic safety.\nBillions of dollars are spent to remove minute amounts of chemicals from\nwater.\n\nBut asking that broader question \u2014 why do people die? \u2014 provides a\nframework for all these other issues: health care, education, poverty,\ndisease, crime, public services, stress, shelter, climate, mobility,\nfamine, pesticides, fatty foods, toxins, pollution, daycare, quality of\nlife. It all comes in corpses: clear, countable, comparable facts. We\u2019re\nall dead bodies in the end.\n\nA ticker at the bottom of the TV news screen gives people\nup-to-the-minute information about how well the stock market is doing.\nNobody tells us how many people are dying right now (107 people every\nminute, 5 of them in the US). When a major stock drops, we hear which\nand how much and why and how it fits into the bigger market picture.\nNobody does the same for deaths, either individual or in outbreaks.\nNobody\u2019s provided an overall look at why people are dying and how all\nour attempts to make the world a better place \u2014 from economic growth to\nclean water \u2014 are helping.

The Franklin W. Olin Foundation, after funding\nengineering buildings on lots of college campuses, finally decided to\ntry to build a whole school itself, eventually putting all of its money\n(an estimated \\$400 million) into Olin College and dissolving itself.\n\nThe college is not shy about spending the money. Every Olin student gets\ncompletely free tuition and a laptop full of engineering software. It\nhas a big beautiful campus on the outskirts of Boston with three huge\nclassroom buildings and six wings of dorms; each student gets a\nstate-of-the-art dorm room.\n\nThe buildings are big and imposing.

A kind and\neager student, who I\u2019ll call Lex, picked me up at the T stop and drove\nme to the campus and is now delivering me to the Computer Architecture\ncourse, which everyone insists is one of the best-taught on campus (by\nwhich, they apparently mean that the teacher is really funny). As we\nwalk through the hallways at 9am I again don\u2019t see a single other\nperson. \u201cGuess nobody wakes up this early,\u201d I say.\n\nLex hands me off to a student in the Computer Architecture class who\nlooks exactly like I imagined: long beard, geeky shirt, started several\nopen source projects.

While I\u2019ve heard of\nbreadboards, I\u2019ve never seen one, let alone played with one before\nclass, and I have to admit I\u2019m not sure what an op-amp is. *Wow*, I\nthink, *these kids are smart.*\n\nNobody here knows who I am \u2014 an odd experience for me, since lately I\u2019ve\nonly been hanging out with friends or going to conferences where people\nknow of me. When they ask, I simply say I\u2019m from Cambridge \u2014 a\nprogrammer at a startup if they push, but few do. Everybody just assumes\nI\u2019m a prospective student visiting and looks down on me accordingly. I\njust try to keep quiet.\n\nThe class itself is taken up by having students do exercises on the\nwhiteboards and then share their results with the class. Students here\nseem a little less embarrassed about getting things wrong in front of\neveryone; they\u2019re happy to describe what they did from their seats.\nAfter everyone has shared, the class ends, and I leave, disappointed.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, so Lex decides to take me on a tour of the facilities.\nOlin College was designed by and for engineers, the idea being that\nstudents who complete the program will have a full, rounded education in\nengineering. So there are classes in math and physics and basic\nprinciples of engineering, all unified into a project-based integrated\ncourseblock or something like that. Then there are classes in materials\nscience and biological science, classes in human factors and\nunderstanding the requirements of actual users, classes in building\nstuff and classes in using it.\n\nThere are lots of toys all over, great food, and an administration which\nis always asking how they can improve things further. The place reminds\nme of nothing so much as Google, which even has a similar kind of\ncampus. I suppose it makes sense: this is what happens when you have\nengineers build an institution.\n\nI grab some pasta for lunch (like at Google, the food isn\u2019t really my\nstyle) and follow Lex to a table. Unlike at other schools, Lex explains,\nkids here don\u2019t sit in cliques. Everybody knows everybody else, so the\ntables just fill up in order. We sit across from two kids who somehow\nturn the conversation from Dean Kamen\u2019s ego to mobius strips, before\ntelling us about a paper they\u2019d written proving that a certain kind of\ngraph of odd *n* can be reformulated on a mobius strip as a series of\npentagons, showing us how by drawing on a napkin. (There are boxes of\nnapkins on the tables, I notice, but not boxes of pens. Pay attention,\ninstitution builders!) The work seems quite impressive; I wonder if it\ncould be published in an actual journal.\n\nThe kids also gab about student life. So-and-so is having a birthday and\nthey\u2019re going to get a keg later to celebrate. Everybody laughs and then\nthey assure me that it\u2019s only a root beer keg. Then they\u2019re going to get\na bunch of ice cream too, so it\u2019ll be a huge root beer float. After\nlunch, I head out with them to downtown Boston to grab the keg and head\nback, a process that takes up most of the afternoon.\n\nOn the way back we stop at a music store. Bored, I pull out my Sidekick\nand check my email, which draws a store employee\u2019s attention.\nLong-haired and with a weathered face in a tight black shirt, he speaks\nin a rocker\u2019s drawl. \u201cWhooaaaa, what is thaaaat?\u201d he says and I quietly\nexplain. He tells us how he thinks computers will eventually be replaced\nby miniature devices, which will be able to communicate with each other\nby bouncing satellite signals off the moon. \u201cOr the sun,\u201d he adds.\n\nTo distract him, I think of saying that my companions are just the\ngeniuses to build such a thing, but they save me the trouble. \u201cAre you\nguys at MIT?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo,\u201d they say, and I realize Olin has a ways to\ngo before its brand catches up with its curriculum. He says he has a\nfriend who\u2019s an expert in seeing the big picture and offers to hook the\nguys up so they can take on the small device manufacturers. (The Olin\nstudents immediately begin thinking about the tools they\u2019d need to build\nsmall devices.) He takes down their names and emails before we head\nback.\n\n\u201cYou have to recognize that everyone has a point of view about\ntechnology,\u201d one Olin student says thoughtfully. \u201cThey taught us that on\nthe designing-for-humans course.\u201d \u201cAnd even if he is crazy,\u201d the other\nadds, \u201chis friend might be cool.\u201d\n\nWhen we get back, I beg off from my guide Lex, saying I\u2019d like to just\ntour the place for myself for a bit. Lex and her circle remind me a\nlittle of Olin cultists \u2014 whenever I ask about Olin their eyes go wide\nand they tell me that it\u2019s the greatest place ever. Perhaps that\u2019s true,\nI think, but I want to see for myself.\n\nAs I walk around the campus in the middle of the afternoon, I notice\nit\u2019s still empty. As far as I can tell, the campus never fills out much\nmore. It turns out 300 people don\u2019t really fill up a large campus (they\nbarely fill up a large auditorium) which means the whole place feels\nlike a ghost town. The immaculately cleaned, yet mysteriously empty\nbuildings everywhere make just walking around feel creepy and lonely.\n\nI catch up with an old friend of mine, who I\u2019ll call Rob, who ended up\ngoing to Olin. Rob is deeply cynical about the place and we head to the\ncampus of Babson College (a leading business school which is literally\nlocated across the sidewalk from Olin) to dish. The Babson campus,\nalthough designed by the same hideous architect, feels like a breath of\nfresh air after Olin\u2019s imposing emptiness. For one thing, there are\nstudents everywhere \u2014 Babson is over ten times the size of Olin. For\nanother, the place is filled with trees, making the whole thing feel\nsmaller and cozier. I don\u2019t recall a single tree on the Olin campus, for\nwhatever reason.\n\nThe mistake everyone makes, Rob explains, is that they think Olin is a\nschool for *hackers*, This isn\u2019t unreasonable, since in the computer\nindustry, hackers are often formally called engineers. But Olin is using\nengineer in its traditional sense, as people who just generally build\nstuff. Computer hacking makes up just a tiny part of the curriculum and\nan even smaller part of the culture. And so computer geeks who end up\nattending Olin just end up feeling left out. Rob is even thinking of\ntaking programming classes at Babson.\n\nPlus, things aren\u2019t as friendly as they seem. At orientation they were\nbig on insisting Olin was a \u201cfeedback culture\u201d \u2014 complete with\nrole-playing exercises about how to properly give feedback (which Rob\nfailed; he insists they claimed his invitation to lunch was \u201ctoo\nnegative\u201d) \u2014 but apparently they don\u2019t actually listen to the feedback\nmuch. The kids sitting near Rob at the dinner table all agree. One even\npulls out a card they gave him with tips on the proper way to give\nfeedback. (When I ask her later, Lex insists that every new batch of\nstudents has its own culture. And this one, she says, enjoys \u201cshaking\nthings up\u201d while hers enjoys stabilizing them.)\n\nDespite Olin\u2019s claims to be \u201cworking with\u201d students, Rob insists that\nthe place feels a lot more like \u201cdoing to\u201d. Instead of having rules, for\nexample, they have a loose honor code with provisions like \u201crespect for\nothers\u201d. But \u201crespect for others\u201d apparently turns out to mean \u201crespect\nfor authority\u201d in practice \u2014 a student who ran their own WiFi base\nstation even after the campus IT department asked for it to be taken\ndown was hauled before the student tribunal on charges of showing\ninsufficient \u201crespect for others\u201d.\n\nAll of this just makes the place feel even more creepy. I think back to\nthe kids tittering about pretending to drink alcohol, about their\nsoliloquies for Olin\u2019s greatness. *Friendly fascism* is the term that\ncomes to mind.\n\nIt\u2019s getting late so I try to find Lex to give me a ride home, but we\nend up at the kegger party. Olin students insist they know how to party\njust like everyone else, but as you might expect, it\u2019s the weirdest\nparty I\u2019ve ever been too. The lights are turned down low and an iTunes\nvisualizer is placed on the TV screen, as some kids try to awkwardly\ndance. But it\u2019s not dark or drunk enough for that, so instead the girls\ngo around standing on tip toes and giving each other hugs while speaking\nin high-pitched voices, before going to get costumes to prance around\nin.\n\nFinally they break open the keg (there is some humor at how the\nengineering students can\u2019t figure out how to operate it) but the root\nbeer doesn\u2019t improve the scene much. I finally manage to find Lex and\nprevail upon her for a ride back to the train station and as we ride\nthrough the darkness she muses about Olin on the way home. I try to tell\nher what I feel, but it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t really want to hear it. To\nher Olin is a place of wonder; she wants validation, not refutation. I\nsuppose my feedback is \u201ctoo negative\u201d.", "external_links": [], "time": 1160463600.0, "postid": "visitingolin", "internal_links": []}, "rewritingreddit": {"post_title": "Rewriting Reddit", "tags": [], "post_content": "Rewriting Reddit\n================\n\nDecember 6, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit)\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Translations:**\n[Srpsko-Hrvatski](http://science.webhostinggeeks.com/ponovno-pisanje-reddit)\n\n*2012 note: This article was first published in 2005. After it was\npublished, Django launched a RemovingTheMagic project to address some of\nmy criticisms (though personally I still find it unusable),\n[web.py](http://webpy.org/) inspired FriendFeed\u2019s\n[tornado.web](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) and Google\u2019s\n[gae.webapp](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/usingwebapp)\nand others (though I still prefer web.py), and this article led to a\npermanent surge in Reddit traffic that still hasn\u2019t really stopped\ngrowing.*\n\n[![reddit mascot](image1_rewritingreddit)](http://reddit.com/)\n\nOver at [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/), we rewrote the site from Lisp\nto Python in the past week. It was pretty much done in one weekend.\n(Disclosure: We used my [web.py](http://webpy.org/) library.) The others\nknew Lisp (they wrote their whole site in it) and they knew Python (they\nrewrote their whole site in it) and yet they decided liked Python better\nfor this project. The Python version had less code that ran faster and\nwas far easier to read and maintain.\n\nThe idea that there is something better than Lisp is apparently\ninconceivable to some, judging from comments [on the reddit\nblog](http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html). The\nLispers instead quickly set about trying to find the *real* reason\nbehind the switch.\n\nOne assumed it must have been divine intervention, since \u201cthere seems to\nbe no other reason for switching to an inferior language.\u201d Another\nfigured something else must be going on: \u201cCould this be\u2026a lie? To throw\noff competition? It\u2019s not as though Paul Graham hasn\u2019t hinted at this\ntactic in his essays\u2026\u201d Another chimed in: \u201cI decided it was a prank.\u201d\nAnother suggested the authors simply wanted more \u201ccut corners, hacks,\nand faked artisanship.\u201d\n\nThese were, of course, extreme cases. Others assumed there must have\nbeen outside pressure. \u201cEither libraries or hiring new programmers I\nguess.\u201d Another concluded: \u201csome vc suit wants a\nmaintainable-by-joe-programmer product. I hope he pays you millions.\u201d\n\nThe Lisp newsgroup, `comp.lang.lisp`, was upset about the switch that\nthey\u2019re currently [planning to *write a competitor* to reddit in\nLisp](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_frm/thread/f560fdfb211aa8cb/c0159fbbc6496def),\nto show how right they are or something.\n\nThe more sane argued along the lines of saying Lisp\u2019s value lies in\nbeing able to create [new linguistic\nconstructs](http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html#113382802678872391)\nand that for something like a simple web app, this isn\u2019t necessary,\nsince the constructs have been already built. But even this isn\u2019t true.\n[web.py](http://webpy.org/) was built pretty much from scratch and uses\nall sorts of \u201cnew linguistic constructs\u201d and \u2014 even better \u2014 these\nconstructs have syntax that goes along with them and makes them\nreasonably readable. Sure, Python isn\u2019t Perl 6, so you can\u2019t add\narbitrary syntax, but you can often find a clever way to get the job\ndone.\n\n* * * * *\n\nPython, on the other hand, has problems of its own. The biggest is that\nit has dozens of web application frameworks, but none of them are any\ngood. Pythonists are well aware of the first part but apparently not of\nthe second, since when I tell them that I\u2019m using my own library, the\nuniversal response is \u201cI don\u2019t think Python needs another web\napplication framework\u201d. Yes, Python needs fewer web application\nframeworks. But it also needs one that doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nThe framework that seems most promising is\n[Django](http://djangoproject.com/) and indeed we initially attempted to\nrewrite Reddit in it. As the most experienced Python programmer, I tried\nmy best to help the others out.\n\nDjango seemed great from the outside: a nice-looking website,\nintelligent and talented developers, and a seeming surplus of nice\nfeatures. The developers and community are extremely helpful and\nresponsive to patches and suggestions. And all the right goals are\nespoused in their philosophy documents and FAQs. Unfortunately, however,\nthey seem completely incapable of living up to them.\n\nWhile Django claims that it\u2019s \u201cloosely coupled\u201d, using it pretty much\nrequires fitting your code into Django\u2019s worldview. Django insists on\nexecuting your code itself, either through its command-line utility or a\nspecialized server handler called with the appropriate environment\nvariables and Python path. When you start a project, by default Django\ncreates folders nested four levels deep for your code and while you can\nmove around some files, I had trouble figuring out which ones and how.\n\nDjango\u2019s philosophy says \u201cExplicit is better than implicit\u201d, but Django\nhas all sorts of magic. Database models you create in one file magically\nappear someplace else deep inside the Django module with a different\nname. When your model function is called, new things have been added to\nits variable-space and old ones removed. (I\u2019m told they\u2019re currently\nworking on fixing both of these, though.)\n\nAnother Django goal is \u201cless code\u201d, at least for you. But Django is\nsimply full of code. Inside the django module are 10 different folders\nand inside each of those are a few more. By the time you actually build\na site in the Django tutorial, you\u2019ve imported `django.core.meta`,\n`django.models.polls`, `django.conf.urls.defaults.*`,\n`django.utils.httpwrappers.HttpResponse`, and\n`django.core.extensions.render_to_response`. It\u2019s not clear how anyone\nis supposed to remember all that, especially since there appear to be no\nguiding principles for what goes where or how it\u2019s named. Three of these\nare inserted automatically by the start scripts, but you still need to\nmemorize such names for every other function you want to use.\n\nBut Django\u2019s most important problem is that its developers seem\nincapable of designing a decent API. They\u2019re clearly capable Python\nprogrammers \u2014 their code uses all sorts of bizarre tricks. And they\u2019re\nclearly able to write code that works \u2014 they have all sorts of\ninteresting features. But they can\u2019t seem to shape this code into\nsomething that other people can use.\n\nTheir APIs are ugly and regularly missing key features: the database API\nfigures out queries by counting underscores but has no special syntax\nfor JOINs, the template system requires four curly braces around every\nvariable and can\u2019t do any sort of computation, the form API requires 15\nlines to process a form and can\u2019t automatically generate the template.\n\nI tried my best to fix things \u2014 and the Django community was extremely\nsupportive \u2014 but the task simply dwarfed me. I just couldn\u2019t do it\nmentally, let alone with the time constraints of having to actually\nbuild my own application for my own startup.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAnd so, Lisp and Django found wanting, we\u2019re left with\n[web.py](http://webpy.org/). I\u2019d like to say that web.py learned from\nthese mistakes and was designed to avoid them, but the truth is that\nweb.py was written long before all this and managed to avoid them\nanyway.\n\nThe way I wrote web.py was simple: I imagined how things should work and\nthen I made that happen. Sometimes making things just work takes a lot\nof code. Sometimes it only takes a little. But either way, that fact is\nhidden from the user \u2014 they just get the ideal API.\n\nSo how should things work? The first principle is that code should be\nclear and simple. If you want to output some text, you call web.output.\nIf you want to get form input, you call web.input. There\u2019s nothing\nparticularly hard to remember.\n\nThe second principle is that web.py should fit your code, not the other\nway around. Every function in web.py is completely independent, you can\nuse whichever ones you want. You can put your files wherever you like,\nand web.py will happily follow along. If you want a piece of code to be\nrun as a web app, you call web.run, you don\u2019t put your code in the\nmagical place so that web.py can run you.\n\nThe third principle is that web.py should, by default, do the right\nthing by the Web. This means distinguishing between GET and POST\nproperly. It means simple, canonical URLs which synonyms redirect to. It\nmeans readable HTML with the proper HTTP headers.\n\nAnd that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, are pretty much all the principles\nyou need. They seem pretty simple and obvious to me and I\u2019m even willing\nto fudge on some of them, but no other Python web app framework seems to\neven come close. (If you know of one, tell me and I\u2019ll happily recant. I\ndon\u2019t want to be in this business.) Until then, it looks like I\u2019m forced\nto do that horrible thing I\u2019d rather not do: release one more Python web\napplication framework into the world.\n\n[image1_rewritingreddit]: image1_rewritingreddit.jpg", "external_links": ["http://science.webhostinggeeks.com/ponovno-pisanje-reddit", "http://webpy.org/", "http://www.tornadoweb.org/", "https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/usingwebapp", "http://reddit.com/", "http://reddit.com/", "http://webpy.org/", "http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html", "http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_frm/thread/f560fdfb211aa8cb/c0159fbbc6496def", "http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html#113382802678872391", "http://webpy.org/", "http://djangoproject.com/", "http://webpy.org/"], "time": 1133856000.0, "postid": "rewritingreddit", "internal_links": []}, "experiences": {"post_title": "When will experiences replace movie theaters?", "tags": [], "post_content": "When will experiences replace movie theaters?\n=============================================\n\nFebruary 14, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/experiences)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen I was a kid, I remember my school putting on a production of *Peter\nPan*. For the dramatic flying scenes, they rigged a special harness that\nwould go under Pan\u2019s costume and hoist him around the stage. But what I\nremember most is sitting outside the theater, desperately wishing it was\nme who got to fly. I knew I had a long life ahead of me, but when do\ngrownups get to fly as if by magic?\n\nThe world is weirdly disappointing that way. Billions of dollars are\nspent making and watching people explore mysterious tunnels, chase down\nalleys, and fly as if by magic, but there\u2019s hardly a single opportunity\nto actually do any of these things.\n\nI know of two exceptions. In Boston, there is a company called [5\nWits](http://www.5-wits.com/). The experience is something like this:\nyou enter an unassuming rug shop and when the salesman asks if he can\nhelp you, you tell him the secret pass code. He gets a funny look on his\nface, locks the door and pulls down the blinds. He pulls back the rug to\nreveal a television screen that briefs you on your secret mission.\n\nOnce briefed, he shows you a concealed door where you tiptoe down to an\nunderground passage way, only to find [one of those arrays of\nlaser-triggers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/eb/Entrapment_Gin_posterior.jpg),\nwhere you have to crawl underneath the lasers without setting them off.\nThis leads to a whole underground lair, where you have to solve various\npuzzles to find the stolen plans, erase evidence of your intrusion, and\ndisarm a bomb. It\u2019s enormous fun.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to think this will be the future of in-person\nentertainment in the era of the Internet. Sure, movie companies are\nloading up on gimmicks like 3D to force people into theaters, but it\u2019s\nhard to see that working in the long-term. No, we should embrace the\ntrend \u2014 let the Internet distribute every movie ever made and free up\nthese physical spaces to provide the kind of experience that you can\nonly provide in an actual physical space.\n\nI feel (have always felt) the same way about museums. Go to a local\nmuseum and look around \u2014 how much do you see that actually couldn\u2019t be\nprovided by a website or a book? That\u2019s why I was so excited to visit\n[the City Museum](http://www.citymuseum.org/) in St. Louis.\n\nIn the dark days of St. Louis, when everyone with money had fled to the\nsuburbs, an artist named Bob Cassilly bought a large abandoned shoe\nfactory downtown. He and his friends begun using scraps and bargains to\nturn the place into a giant sculpture park. As you walk in, you enter\nthe mouth of a giant whale, inside there are dozens of passage ways to\ncrawl through and climb on, each filled with its own surprises and\nsculptures. Crawl down and you\u2019re led through a network of caves which\nspiral upward and upward until you find yourself atop a giant\neight-story slide. As you slide down, picking up speed, you literally\nride through a giant classical organ, playing music so loud it shakes\nyou to your bones. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nThe City Museum has been so successful, its led a renaissance of\ndowntown St. Louis. Part of the building has been turned into offices\nand trendy lofts and the neighborhood now has some trendy restaurants\nand a shuttle. I flew to St. Louis just to visit it and I don\u2019t regret\nit one bit.\n\nBut I am mystified by why there aren\u2019t more places like these. There\u2019s\ndefinitely a universe where I work on building more. Instead we get\nbland amusement parks, pretentious performances like Punchdrunk, and\ndull museums and galleries. New York City worked itself into a tizzy\nwhen artist Carsten Holler exhibited a slide a quarter of the size of\nthe one at the City Museum. Surely a city of that size can support a\nplace like this of its own.

Yeah, I\u2019m such a\ncheapskate.)\n\nThe book is a response to the conservative attacks on academia as a\nleftist preserve in need of some affirmative action for conservatives.\nIn response, Berub\u00e9 outlines a two-pronged plan for handling\nconservatives in academia; an outline of a procedural liberalism for the\nliberal arts. First, in the classroom, conservatives should be given\n\u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for their views, just like any other student\nin the class. Second, in the professoriate, conservatives should try to\nreform academia by joining it, just as the women\u2019s liberation movement\ndid in the 1970s.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor the first, Berub\u00e9 gives examples from his own classroom: a\nconservative makes a claim (e.g. the Japanese internment was justified),\nBerub\u00e9 patiently acknowledges it, points to sources supporting and\nopposes it, and sits down with the conservative outside of class to give\nthem further attention. Berub\u00e9 comes off as unfailing patient and\ngracious, while the conservatives appear wrong-headed and often simply\nlazy.\n\nAnd yet. Despite my enormous sympathy for Berub\u00e9 \u2014 I tried to do my part\nto oppose Horowitz and hanging out with the AAUP\u2019s Graham Larkin at\nStanford is one of my more cherished memories \u2014 I can\u2019t help imagining\nmyself in the position at the conservative. As Rick Perlstein (a mutual\nfriend) has noted, sometimes the only friends the far-right can find are\non the far-left. For *I* [was once almost tossed out of class\nonce](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001518) for my political views (in that\ncase, insisting that the US didn\u2019t attack Vietnam to fight the spread of\nCommunism).\n\nBerub\u00e9\u2019s clear writing, intelligence, and thoroughgoing kindness made me\nwant to hop the next flight to Pennsylvania and audit his classes.\n(Thankfully, he closes the book with two lengthy chapters summarizing\ntwo major courses that he teaches, somewhat saving me the trouble.) But\nhad Berub\u00e9 been my teacher, would things have been different? One\ndisagrees with Berub\u00e9 at one\u2019s own peril \u2014 his snark is sharp enough to\ntake your head clean off \u2014 but having seen his dismissive blog\ncommentary on leftists, I can\u2019t help but wonder.\n\nHis not-as-left-as-thou attitude carries over into the book as well.\nWhen conservatives attack a professor for claiming Israel is a \u201cracist\nstate\u201d, Berub\u00e9 doesn\u2019t defend him but instead mocks the professor\u2019s\nattempts to defend the comment. And when the discussion turns to\nstudents who are fans of Michael Parenti (are there any?), he foresees\nonly two possibilities for their future: either they renounce Parenti or\nthey dumb themselves down to his level. I\u2019m no fan of Parenti, but it\ntakes an awful lot of confidence to say the only people who could agree\nwith him are idiots.\n\nBerub\u00e9 longs for intelligent conservatives that he can debate, but when\nit comes to intelligent leftists, he just wants to mock. But even if he\ntreated them the same, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019d be much better. The \u201cI see\nwhere you\u2019re coming from, here\u2019s someone else who makes that argument\u201d\ntrick \u2014 while eminently reasonable \u2014 is incredibly effective at robbing\na young person of their moral indignation. It suggests that the question\nisn\u2019t one to be resolved, but simply one to be accepted as a fact of\nlife: some people believe the Vietnam War was to fight Communism, others\ndisagree. But when we\u2019re talking about the lives of millions, such\nambivalence is more frustrating than outright disagreement.\n\nBerub\u00e9 discusses this too, in his penultimate chapter on postmodernism\n(a discussion of how he discusses topics by discussing the topic of\ndiscussion!). I can\u2019t say I was convinced by his positions in the\nLyotard-Harbermas debate or the Rorty-Nagel one, but the discussion did\nspur me to more thoroughly codify my own. And really, isn\u2019t that what\nthe liberal arts \u2014 at their best \u2014 are about? Whether through a\ncombative debate with a partisan or a paternalistic moderation of the\nsubject by a procedural liberal, any time a teacher gets a student to\nrefine their views counts as a win in my book. The essential thing is\nthat the question \u2014 and the position \u2014 be taken seriously.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMore serious is the second question: what do we do about groupthink in\nthe professoriate? Berub\u00e9 makes the convincing case that academia\u2019s lack\nof conservatives is simply because it isn\u2019t a very good job for them. I\nknow that if I was a young conservative, I\u2019d be [riding the conservative\ngravy\ntrain](http://www.campusprogress.org/features/161/guy-benson-the-message-machine)\ninstead of spending years in graduate school. The cost-benefit analysis\nisn\u2019t even close.\n\nBut clearly academia isn\u2019t completely infallible. How do you change the\nculture of a field when it\u2019s gone off-course? Berub\u00e9\u2019s suggestion is\nthat you just play by the rules and stick to your principles. His\nexample is the women\u2019s liberation movement, which succeeded in turning\nfeminism into a real mode of literary criticism. But that seems like a\nsomewhat atypical case.\n\nWhat about economics departments, filled with professors whose theories\nneatly support right-wing social principles but rarely conform with any\nexternal evidence? What about psychology departments whose claims and\nexperiments all-too-often make a mockery of the scientific method?\n\nNo self-respecting scientist would admit to being interested in an\npsuedoscience like psychology. If you tried (as I have) your friends\nwould loudly mock you for it. And if that doesn\u2019t dissuade you, they\nstart wondering if you\u2019re really as smart as they first thought. After\nall, why would anyone intelligent go into such a bogus field?\n\nI certainly don\u2019t support an Academic Bill of Rights or any such\nnonsense \u2014 I want to improve academia, not destroy it. In fact, I don\u2019t\nhave any great ideas for solving these problems. But I also don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s fair to simply dismiss them, as Berub\u00e9 seems to. The\nself-reinforcing groupthink of academia is a problem; it prevents\nexactly the kind of critical sharpening that I argue is the best part of\neducation. And as a structural problem, it would seem to require a\nstructural change.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis is, to be clear, not the meat of Berub\u00e9\u2019s book, which spends its\nfirst half mocking the conservative critique on academia and the second\nsummarizing Berub\u00e9\u2019s own classes. Indeed, I don\u2019t think the proposals\nI\u2019m responding to account for more than a couple paragraphs of the text.\nNonetheless, those were the paragraphs that provoked my thoughts, so now\nI\u2019m defending them, just like a good student should.\n\n* * * * *\n\n-   [Buy the book from Amazon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393060373)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://www.campusprogress.org/features/161/guy-benson-the-message-machine", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393060373"], "time": 1159945200.0, "postid": "radicalarts", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001518"]}, "hospitallife": {"post_title": "Life in the Hospital", "tags": [], "post_content": "Life in the Hospital\n====================\n\nOctober 1, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitallife)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*An extra-special guest post [hoisted from\ncomments](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/femhosp#c6)!*\n\n> The very walls of the hospital seemed to suck the life out of\n> me\u2014painted in puke yellow\u2014and the window, which did look out at some\n> trees, unfortunately framed a week\u2019s worth of grey, rainy weather.

His specific example is perhaps easy\nto mock, but it has resonance because the problem is a real one. [As\nPaul Graham shows](http://www.paulgraham.com/resay.html), in general\nphysicists are smarter than social scientists. But (to use a Grahamism),\nlike kids trying to act adult, the social scientists end up emulating\nthe form of these fields but not the content. In other words, instead of\ngetting smarter, they play make-believe.\n\nThe first thing that comes is the numbers. Real science papers are\nfilled with tables and graphs and regressions on piles of data, so the\nsocial scientists decide to do all that. In economics, they even go so\nfar as to start coming up with equations and proving theorems. Then\ncomes the technical language. Physics papers discuss the \u201cgravitational\nwave perturbations about a brane cosmology embedded in a\nfive-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk\u201d so the cult studs decide they\nshould be just as incomprehensible.\n\nAnd then, in the headiness of this newfound power of *science*, grand\nclaims are made. As J. K. Galbraith writes (\\_Annals of an Abiding\nLiberal, p. 4): \u201cIt is the great desire of nearly all economists to see\ntheir subject as a science too. Accordingly, and without much thought,\nthey hold that its matter is also fixed. The business firm, the market,\nthe behavior of the consumer, like the oxygen molecule or the\ngeologist\u2019s granite, are given.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that there is anything intrinsically wrong with using\nmath or jargon or making grand claims. But to adopt these habits\nreflexively is to put the means before the ends. Scientists do not use\nmath because it is complicated but because, for what they are doing, it\nis effective. Their grand pronouncements become accepted because\n(sometimes, at least) they are true.\n\nSuch complaints, among a certain sector, are truisms. But the conclusion\ntypically drawn with them is pure pessimism. Social behavior, they\nargue, is simply too complex for us to ever make real progress in the\nfield. The topic is studied by idiots and charlatans because the\nintelligent and honest can immediately see its impossibility. I do not\nagree with such a view. In fact, I think it is only possible to maintain\nit thru abject ignorance of what science really knows.\n\nThe vulgar postmodern critique of science argued that scientists had\nbecome our modern priesthood: deified as \u201cexperts\u201d they would make\nclaims about how the world worked, claims with just as much authority as\nthose made by religion in earlier times. And while such comparisons were\nwrong, they did betray a truth: society has, for largely selfish\nreasons, inflated the accomplishments of science beyond their actual\nexistence. (See R. C. Lewontin\u2019s fabulous *Biology as Ideology* for\nevidence of this theme, from a respected scientist.)\n\nScientists \u2014 even the hardest of scientists \u2014 fabricate data, fabricate\nstudies, fall prey to fads, and otherwise get things wrong. But more\nrelevantly, they just don\u2019t know that much. We have very little idea of\nhow the body works; the pills we take are made through the bluntest of\nmeans. We don\u2019t know how to calculate very simple things, like the\ndispersion of milk in a cup of coffee. The illusion that social science\nis ineffective can only be sustained by ignorance of such\nineffectiveness of hard science. The upside of all this is that there is\nhope for social science.\n\nSo what is to be done? For reasons beyond the scope of this article, its\nunlikely that the existing disciplines can be reformed. Instead what is\nneeded is a culture of serious social science built outside the existing\nsystems of academia. Its work should be primarily outwardly-facing,\nbecause that\u2019s the important audience. This means clear writing (unlike\nthis article, perhaps) for public consumption. And it means compilations\nof broad scope, instead of obscure monographs.\n\nWe can already see the beginnings of such a thing in the work by people\nlike Doug Henwood and Christian Parenti. But there is certainly much\nmore to do, including building structures to do the work in.\n\nSo that\u2019s the other thing I\u2019m thinking about.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.paulgraham.com/resay.html"], "time": 1121929200.0, "postid": "socialscience", "internal_links": []}, "pgwrong": {"post_title": "Paul Graham is Wrong", "tags": ["satire", "personal"], "post_content": "Paul Graham is Wrong\n====================\n\nSeptember 21, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/pgwrong)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham.

Graham never considers that possibility. He just\nassumes that he\u2019s right.\n\nOnce, in an interview, Graham was asked what he thought about this\nsubject:\n\n> *Q: What do you think of people doing that thing?*\n>\n> Well, you know, historically people really haven\u2019t done a lot of this\n> thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening\n> because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no\n> longer exist. This could really change things.\n\nBut this is absurd! Just because people *can* do that thing now doesn\u2019t\nmean they\u2019re going to.\n\nFor too long, Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that\ndisagree with people\u2019s prejudices in an informative and entertaining\nmanner. That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and\nread it. But this time he\u2019s gone too far: he\u2019s said something that might\nactually make me change how I behave.

Most of his argument is that the labels already sell the vast\nmajority of their music perfect digital copies without DRM \u2014 namely, CDs\n\u2014 but he also argues that the alternative of having an \u201copen\u201d DRM system\nis impossible.\n\nJobs is less than clear here. He writes: \u201cThere is no theory of\nprotecting content other than keeping secrets. In other words, even if\none uses the most sophisticated cryptographic locks to protect the\nactual music, one must still \u2018hide\u2019 the keys which unlock the music on\nthe user\u2019s computer or portable music player. No one has ever\nimplemented a DRM system that does not depend on such secrets for its\noperation.\u201d\n\nSince this is a fairly important point and no one else is explaining\nwhat he means, I thought I\u2019d give it a try.\n\nDRM works by encrypting songs. Encryption works by performing a\nmathematical scrambling operation that can only be reversed with the\nright \u201ckey\u201d. As a very simple example, imagine you have the message\n\u201chello\u201d and the key \u201c5\u201d. One simple encryption system is to simply move\neach letter five letters forward (so \u201ca\u201d becomes \u201cf\u201d) and you get\n\u201cmjqqt\u201d. To decode it, you just need to know the number 5 and move each\nletter back that far. (This is a very bad encryption system, for a lot\nof reasons, but it works the same basic way as the good ones.)\n\nThe way DRM works, essentially, is that when you buy a song from the\niTunes store it\u2019s encrypted with a certain secret key (presumably one a\nlot bigger than the number 5). To play the music, you need the key to\ndecrypt it. But the only software that has the key is iTunes and iTunes\nwill only decrypt it if you\u2019re following their rules \u2014 only playing it\non 5 separate machines, for example.\n\nFor \u201cOpen DRM\u201d to work, Apple would need to give the key to other people\nwho made music players. But as soon as Apple gives the key to someone,\nthey can do whatever they want with the music. If the key gets out on\nthe Internet, anyone can decrypt the songs. DRM only works because the\nkey is secret.

Dan Connolly,\nwho might be considered the \\#2 guy at the W3C (after Tim Berners-Lee,\nthe Web\u2019s inventor, of course), saw that I was in Cambridge and invited\nme to come over this evening.\n\nWhen I got there he introduced me to fellow TAG members Norm Walsh (who\nsome readers may know as the DocBook guy) and Henry Thompson (author of\nxsv) and we all headed to a pool hall. Tired from a long day arguing\nabout such weighty subjects, they tried to avoid talking about them,\nwhich ended up meaning that they mostly talked about pool. I\u2019d never\nplayed pool before but in two games I was able to make one or two\nhalf-way decent shots.

And even if you\u2019re arrogant enough to believe you\u2019re\na better person in some way \u2014 smarter, harder-working, more ambitious \u2014\nsince when does being better give you the right to tell other people how\nto live their lives? Is Tiger Woods allowed to just come along and take\nthe chocolate out of *your* shopping cart at the supermarket?\n\nIt is a sad fact of reality that you have money and he has none and\nthat, as a result, he needs the money to buy material goods. But no\n*moral* consequences can be derived from this. Just because history has\ngiven you the *power* to choose whether this person can acquire certain\nmaterial goods doesn\u2019t give you the *right* to make that call.\n\nNow it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t have to give him money at all. Most don\u2019t. But\nif you feel that other people deserve to live a life without privation,\nat least let them choose how to live that life.\n\nPerhaps an example closer to home will help. Remember when your father\noffered to help you buy a house if only you went back to school? That\nwas the same thing \u2014 trying to use the fact that he had money and you\ndidn\u2019t in order to get you to do what he wanted. For years, he\u2019d been\ntrying to get you to go back to school; and you didn\u2019t, because it was\nyour decision and you didn\u2019t want to. But then he realized he could use\nthe money to control you. Remember how that chafed?\n\nAt the time you brushed it off as \u201chis money, his call\u201d. But don\u2019t you\nsee how that\u2019s not true? Whether you go to school or not was never his\ncall. And while it\u2019s certainly within his rights to help you buy a\nhouse, using that to try to and control you was wrong.

When I decided\nto get into political journalism, *Extra!* was the first magazine I\nturned to. Every other month they issue a brilliant magazine full of\narticles which collect and dissect the standard media narratives on a\nparticular issue and then lay out the real story for you. It\u2019s\ninvaluable. I think of their work as a good digest of the news: you get\nthe same misinformation you\u2019d get everywhere else but you also get how\nand why it\u2019s misinformation.\n\nFor my first piece, I decided to take on the noise machine that\u2019s been\nloudly proclaiming in news outlets across the land that the\nenvironmentalist movement, headed by Rachel Carson, is responsible for\nthe deaths of millions of African babies. Why? Because they discouraged\nthe use of the noxious pesticide DDT, which was previously used for\ncontrolling the spread of malaria.\n\nFor the article, I dug into the science, interviewed the man behind the\nmisinformation campaign (Roger Bate, a character straight out of *Thank\nYou For Smoking*), and corrected claims from right-wing think tanks (no,\nRachel Carson did not kill all those babies) and from blogs (no, the\nwhole misinformation campaign is not funded by the tobacco companies).\n\nYou can read the full article [on *Extra!*\u2019s\nwebsite](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3186) or I\u2019ve put up [a\nversion linking to all my\nsources](http://aaronsw.jottit.com/rachelcarson).\n\nAn interesting footnote: As I noted above, Roger Bate insisted he had\nnot been funded by the tobacco companies, as many have claimed. Instead,\nhe said, their main original funder was the [May and Stanley Smith\nCharitable Trust](http://www.adminitrustllc.com/foundations/mssct.htm).\nThe trust, a \\$264 million California foundation started by a mining\nmagnate, has the mission of \u201cprovid[ing] grants to organizations that\nserve the needs of children, the elderly, the disabled, and the\ndisadvantaged.\u201d However, it has also been a major contributor to the\nlibertarian Cato Institute and George Mason University. Bate says that\nits trustee, Luther Avery, didn\u2019t \u201cagree entirely with everything I was\nsuggesting\u201d but at least thought \u201cthe debate was worthy of being\nexposed.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Luther Avery passed away, leaving his \\$400,000 a year trustee\njob to his son, Mark Avery, making Mark the fifth highest-paid\nfoundation executive in the Bay Area ([*San Francisco Business Times*,\n11/14/03](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/10/BAG46QCQFB1.DTL)).\nBut apparently that wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 Avery stole \\$52 million from the\nFoundation and fled to Alaska.

They\nhad strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly. \u2026 It was\nconsidered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United\nStates.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM\nplant in Fremont,\u201d adds Jeffrey Liker, a professor who studied the\nplant. \u201cIf you want sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it\u2019s\nthere. During breaks, during lunch time, if you want to gamble\nillegally\u2014any illegal activity was available for the asking within that\nplant.\u201d Absenteeism was so bad that some mornings they didn\u2019t have\nenough employees to start the assembly line; they had to go across the\nstreet and drag people out of the bar.\n\nWhen management tried to punish workers, workers tried to punish them\nright back: scratching cars, loosening parts in hard-to-reach places,\nfiling union grievances, sometimes even building cars unsafely. It was\nwar.\n\nIn 1982, GM finally closed the plant. But the very next year, when\nToyota was planning to start its first plant in the US, it decided to\npartner with GM to reopen it, hiring back the same old disastrous\nworkers into the very same jobs. And so began the most fascinating\nexperiment in management history.\n\nToyota flew this rowdy crew to Japan, to see an entirely different way\nof working: The Toyota Way. At Toyota, labor and management considered\nthemselves on the same team; when workers got stuck, managers didn\u2019t\nyell at them, but asked how they could help and solicited suggestions.\nIt was a revelation. \u201cYou had union workers\u2014grizzled old folks that had\nworked on the plant floor for 30 years, and they were hugging their\nJapanese counterparts, just absolutely in tears,\u201d recalls their Toyota\ntrainer. \u201cAnd it might sound flowery to say 25 years later, but they had\nhad such a powerful emotional experience of learning a new way of\nworking, a way that people could actually work together\ncollaboratively\u2014as a team.\u201d\n\nThree months after they got back to the US and reopened the plant,\neverything had changed. Grievances and absenteeism fell away and workers\nstarted saying they actually enjoyed coming to work. The Fremont\nfactory, once one of the worst in the US, had skyrocketed to become the\nbest. The cars they made got near-perfect quality ratings. And the cost\nto make them had plummeted. It wasn\u2019t the workers who were the problem;\nit was the system.^[1](#fn:tal)^\n\n* * * * *\n\nAn organization is not just a pile of people, it\u2019s also a set of\nstructures. It\u2019s almost like a machine made of men and women. Think of\nan assembly line. If you just took a bunch of people and threw them in a\nwarehouse with a bunch of car parts and a manual, it\u2019d probably be a\ndisaster. Instead, a careful structure has been built: car parts roll\ndown on a conveyor belt, each worker does one step of the process,\neverything is carefully designed and routinized. Order out of chaos.\n\nAnd when the system isn\u2019t working, it doesn\u2019t make sense to just yell at\nthe people in it \u2014 any more than you\u2019d try to fix a machine by yelling\nat the gears. True, sometimes you have the wrong gears and need to\nreplace them, but more often you\u2019re just using them in the wrong way.\nWhen there\u2019s a problem, you shouldn\u2019t get angry with the gears \u2014 you\nshould fix the machine.\n\nIf you have goals in life, you\u2019re probably going to need some sort of\norganization. Even if it\u2019s an organization of just you, it\u2019s still\nhelpful to think of it as a kind of machine. You don\u2019t need to do every\npart of the process yourself \u2014 you just need to set up the machine so\nthat the right outcomes happen.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you want to build a treehouse in the backyard.\nYou\u2019re great at sawing and hammering, but architecture is not your\nforte. You build and build, but the treehouses keep falling down. Sure,\nyou can try to get better at architecture, develop a better design, but\nyou can also step back, look at the machine as a whole, and decide to\nfire yourself as the architect. Instead, you find a friend who loves\nthat sort of thing to design the treehouse for you and you stick to\nactually building it. After all, your goal was to build a treehouse\nwhose design you like \u2014 does it really matter whether you\u2019re the one who\nactually designed it?^[2](#fn:dalio)^\n\nOr let\u2019s say you really want to get in shape, but never remember to\nexercise. You can keep beating yourself up for your forgetfulness, or\nyou can put a system in place. Maybe you have your roommate check to see\nthat you exercise before you leave your house in the morning or you set\na regular time to consistently go to the gym together. Life isn\u2019t a high\nschool exam; you don\u2019t have to solve your problems on your own.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn 1967, Edward Jones and Victor Harris gathered a group of college\nstudents and asked them to judge another student\u2019s exam (the student was\na fictional character, but let\u2019s call him Jim). The exam always had one\nquestion, asking Jim to write an essay on Fidel Castro \u201cas if [he] were\ngiving the opening statement in a debate.\u201d But what sort of essay Jim\nwas supposed to write varied: some of them required Jim to write a\n*defense* of Castro, others required Jim to write a *critique* of\nCastro, the rest left the choice up to Jim. The kids in the experiment\nwere asked to read Jim\u2019s essay and then were asked whether they thought\nJim himself was pro- or anti-Castro.\n\nJones and Harris weren\u2019t expecting any shocking results here; their goal\nwas just to show the obvious: that people would conclude Jim was\npro-Castro when he voluntarily chose write to a pro-Castro essay, but\nnot when he was forced to by the teacher. But what they found surprised\nthem: even when the students could easily see the question *required*\nJim to write a pro-Castro essay, they still rated Jim as significantly\nmore pro-Castro. It seemed hard to believe. \u201cPerhaps some of the\nsubjects were inattentive and did not clearly understand the context,\u201d\nthey suspected.\n\nSo they tried again. This time they explained the essay was written for\na debate tournament, where the student had been randomly assigned to\neither the for or against side of the debate. They wrote it in big\nletters on the blackboard, just to make this perfectly clear. But again\nthey got the same results \u2014 even more clearly this time. They still\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. Maybe, they figured, students thought Jim\u2019s\narguments were so compelling he must really believe them to be able to\ncome up with them.\n\nSo they tried a third time \u2014 this time recording Jim on tape along with\nthe experimenter *giving him the arguments* to use. Surely no one would\nthink Jim came up with them on his own now. Again, the same striking\nresults: students were persuaded Jim believed the arguments he said,\neven when they knew he had no choice in making them.^[3](#fn:jh)^\n\nThis was an extreme case, but we make the same mistake all the time. We\nsee a sloppily-parked car and we think \u201cwhat a terrible driver,\u201d not \u201che\nmust have been in a real hurry.\u201d Someone keeps bumping into you at a\nconcert and you think \u201cwhat a jerk,\u201d not \u201cpoor guy, people must keep\nbumping into him.\u201d A policeman beats up a protestor and we think \u201cwhat\nan awful person,\u201d not \u201cwhat terrible training.\u201d The mistake is so common\nthat in 1977 Lee Ross decided to name it the \u201cfundamental attribution\nerror\u201d: we attribute people\u2019s behavior to their personality, not their\nsituation.^[4](#fn:lr)^\n\n* * * * *\n\nOur natural reaction when someone screws up is to get mad at them. This\nis what happened at the old GM plant: workers would make a mistake and\nmanagement would yell and scream. If asked to explain the yelling,\nthey\u2019d probably say that since people don\u2019t like getting yelled at, it\u2019d\nteach them be more careful next time.\n\nBut this explanation doesn\u2019t really add up. Do you think the workers\nliked screwing up? Do you think they enjoyed making crappy cars? Well,\nwe don\u2019t have to speculate: we know the very same workers, when given\nthe chance to do good work, took pride in it and started actually\nenjoying their jobs.\n\nThey\u2019re just like you, when you\u2019re trying to exercise but failing. Would\nit have helped to have your friend just yell and scream at you for being\nsuch a lazy loser? Probably not \u2014 it probably would have just made you\nfeel worse. What worked wasn\u2019t yelling, but changing the system around\nyou so that it was easier to do what you already wanted to do.\n\nThe same is true for other people. Chances are, they don\u2019t *want* to\nannoy you, they don\u2019t like screwing up. So what\u2019s going to work isn\u2019t\nyelling at them, but figuring out how to change the situation. Sometimes\nthat means changing how you behave. Sometimes that means bringing\nanother person into the mix. And sometimes it just means simple stuff,\nlike changing the way things are laid out or putting up reminders.\n\nAt the old GM plant, in Fremont, workers were constantly screwing things\nup: \u201ccars with engines put in backwards, cars without steering wheels or\nbrakes. Some were so messed up they wouldn\u2019t start, and had to be towed\noff the line.\u201d Management would yell at the workers, but what could you\ndo? Things were moving so fast. \u201cA car a minute don\u2019t seem like it\u2019s\nmoving that fast,\u201d noted one worker, \u201cbut when you don\u2019t get it, you\u2019re\nin the hole. There\u2019s nobody to pull you out at General Motors, so you\u2019re\ngoing to let something go.\u201d\n\nAt the Toyota plant, they didn\u2019t just let things go. There was a red\ncord running above the assembly line, known as an andon cord, and if you\never found yourself in the hole, all you had to do was pull it, and the\nwhole line would stop. Management would come over and ask you how they\ncould help, if there was a way they could fix the problem. And they\u2019d\nactually listen \u2014 and do it!\n\nYou saw the results all over the factory: mats and cushions for the\nworkers to kneel on; hanging shelves traveling along with the cars,\ncarrying parts; special tools invented specifically to solve problems\nthe workers had identified. Those little things added up to make a big\ndifference.\n\nWhen you\u2019re upset with someone, all you want to do is change the way\nthey\u2019re acting. But you can\u2019t control what\u2019s inside a person\u2019s head.\nYelling at them isn\u2019t going to make them come around, it\u2019s just going to\nmake them more defiant, like the GM workers who keyed the cars they\nmade.\n\nNo, you can\u2019t force other people to change. You can, however, change\njust about everything else. And usually, that\u2019s enough.\n\nEmail me about new posts: Go\\\n(I won\u2019t use your email for anything else, promise.)\n\nOr just [follow me on Twitter\nhere](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=aaronsw).\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

For a\nwhile I tried to impress them with [my pearls of\nwisdom](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity) but soon I just sort\nof gave up. I don\u2019t really feel like I do anything special \u2014 I worry\nabout getting stuff done a lot, but mostly I just sort of do it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started working in an office that the question begun\nto make sense. Since I moved to San Francisco I literally haven\u2019t gotten\nanything done. I haven\u2019t finished a book (I finished three on the plane\nout here), I haven\u2019t answered many emails (I used to answer hundreds a\nday), I\u2019ve written only a couple blog posts (I used to do one a day),\nand I haven\u2019t written a line of code (I used to write whole programs in\nthe evenings). It\u2019s a pretty incredible state of affairs.\n\nYou wake up in the morning, take some crushing public transit system or\ndodge oncoming traffic to get to work, grab some food, and then sit down\nat your desk. If you\u2019re like most people, you sit at a cube in the\nmiddle of the office, with white noise buzzing around on every side.\nWe\u2019re lucky enough to get our own shared office, but it\u2019s not much\nbetter since it\u2019s huge windows overlook a freeway and the resulting\nwhite noise is equally deadening.\n\nWired has tried to make the offices look exciting by painting the walls\nbright pink but the gray office monotony sneaks through all the same.\nGray walls, gray desks, gray noise. The first day I showed up here, I\nsimply couldn\u2019t take it. By lunch time I had literally locked myself in\na bathroom stall and started crying. I can\u2019t imagine staying sane with\nsomeone buzzing in my ear all day, let alone getting any actual work\ndone.\n\nNobody else seems to get work done here either. Everybody\u2019s always\ncoming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new\nvideo game system that *Wired* is testing. The upside is that while we\nhaven\u2019t gotten much of our work done, we have managed to do many other\npeople\u2019s. Various folks from around the office have shown up to have us\nhelp them with their technical problems, which we usually solve fairly\nquickly. We joked that we should get transferred to their IT department\ninstead of Web development.\n\nWe\u2019ve been spared most of the brunt of it, but their IT policy is pretty\nscary. There\u2019s a company Internet connection, which routes everything\nthrough the IT HQ in Delaware, presumably the better to spy on us on. On\nDay 1 they took our laptops and \u201cbacked up\u201d the drives to ensure they\nhad a copy of all our data. (We scurried to get our MP3 collections and\nworse off first.)\n\nThen they issued us company-approved laptops: terribly-slow iBook G4s\ncomplete with Conde Nast desktop and screensaver with spy software\npre-installed. When they gave us the machines we didn\u2019t even have\nadministrator access on them. The clock was set to the Eastern time\nzone; I needed an IT department person to change it to show me\nCalifornia time.\n\nThe company laptop is necessary to read our company email which, being\non a Microsoft Exchange server, requires a special Microsoft email\nclient to read. You also need to be on a company laptop to access the\ncompany network, where you can log into a maze of PeopleSoft web sites\nto file expense reports and change your health benefits.\n\nI feel wiped after dealing with this non-work for a couple hours, but I\ncan\u2019t get any rest from lying on our couch because it too is surrounded\nby the white noise.\n\nFinally at 5 the office empties out and I can go home where, to\ncompensate for the dullness of the days, I brighten up the nights.\nLife-threatening bicycle rides, dinners and movies with friends,\nmuseums, running along the beach, navigating the nightmare of public\ntransit to visit the new hot spot. And if I get home early there are the\nroommates eager to chat about their days. By the time I break away it\u2019s\nmidnight, if not 3am. I had to spend much of the weekend sleeping just\nto catch up.\n\nAnd then it\u2019s back to the grind once again. A carousel that never stops\nto let you get off.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1163577600.0, "postid": "officespace", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity"]}, "awfulmuseums": {"post_title": "Museums and Exploratoriums", "tags": [], "post_content": "Museums and Exploratoriums\n==========================\n\nDecember 21, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/awfulmuseums)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe San Francisco Exploratorium is widely regarded as one of the finest\nhands-on museums in the world.

Like most media of American\neducation, museums are hugely ineffective edifices.\n\nThe museum presents a golden opportunity to teach. You have a crowd that\nis explicitly seeking out knowledge, coming to you in person, giving you\na large chunk of their time, and accompanied by their friends and\nfamily. It is hard to imagine a more ideal setting for education. And\nyet, this golden chance is squandered by boring exhibit designs.\n\nMany museums simply present nominally educational things, like pieces of\nart or natural specimens of science, with a couple sentences of\nexplanation. It is not clear what one is actually supposed to learn from\nthis and in practice the answer seems to be: not much.\n\nScience museums take things another step by showing actual examples of\nphysical principles, and the Exploratorium goes a step further by\nletting the kids control them. But in my experience although there were\nmany interesting principles on display, there was little learning. Each\nexhibit has been regarded as a little toy, to be pushed and prodded\nuntil you get bored and move on to something else.\n\nIt\u2019s not the visitor\u2019s fault: the exhibit makes the principle at work\nless than clear and even if someone was interested in reading the\naccompanying text, it rarely says much more than the name of the\nphenomenon; no actual explanation is provided.\n\nMuseums have infuriated me on this front since I visited them as a\nlittle kid. I remember drawing up plans for a genuinely educational\nmuseum, and although I was extremely young at the time, the general\nprinciples still seem sound: split people up into groups, have them try\nto solve real problems, encourage them to sit and engage with something\nover time instead of flitting from exhibit to exhibit, make it just as\nrewarding for adults as well as kids. (My more specific ideas from that\nperiod, involving floating chairs going down rear-projection tunnels,\nseem a little sillier.)\n\nBut even in the multi-exhibit model used by the Exploratorium there is\nmuch that could be improved. The exhibits could use what Tufte calls\n\u201csmall multiples\u201d to give kids a physical intuition about a phenomenon\nby letting them change the relevant variables, rather than just showing\nthem one case. The descriptions could give the force vectors and\nequations for each examples instead of just the name. Some of it might\ngo over kids heads, but even just getting them accustomed to such things\nis a valuable skill.\n\nMuseums, [like lectures](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/awfullectures),\nseem to be one of those things that are simply taken for granted as a\nnecessary part of being cultured. Cities have to have them, citizens\nhave to visit them. Everybody involved feels virtuous about the\nenterprise and nobody ever asks if anything is being learned.\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/1878257145"], "time": 1166688000.0, "postid": "awfulmuseums", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/awfullectures"]}, "ostensiblenetworks": {"post_title": "Ostensible Networks vs. Friendship Networks", "tags": ["identity", "personal", "sociology"], "post_content": "Ostensible Networks vs. Friendship Networks\n===========================================\n\nNovember 18, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ostensiblenetworks)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI visited New York last weekend and although I\u2019d physically been there\nmany times before, this was the first time I felt like I\u2019d really seen\nthe city. Ostensibly, it\u2019s very easy to go to New York. There are lots\nof plane tickets available online and then you can book a hotel right\nthere. I\u2019ve done this many times before and every time I came away\nfeeling like I hadn\u2019t really seen New York, but only bits and pieces\nmade available for tourist consumption. I didn\u2019t feel like I understood\nthe city.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until this time, when I stayed with generous friends, that I\nfelt I really saw the city. They showed me cute little places to eat,\nexplained how to use the impossibly complex transit system, pointed me\nto maps and websites to help, recommended good spots to see at good\ntimes, and simply let me be with actual New Yorkers. I saw New York\nthrough the eyes of a New Yorker.\n\nNow there are ostensible systems to help with all of these. There are\nguidebooks to recommend restaurants and infodesks and posters to explain\nhow things work, but they never really can surpass the power of a\nfriend.\n\nIf you look, you see ostensible networks everywhere. Ostensibly, jobs\nare posted in the want ads, but you can definitely snag one if you have\na friend. Ostensibly, there are bureaucratic rules that must be\nfollowed, but usually can bypass them with a friend on the inside.\nOstensibly, academic fields are learnable by anyone, but to really\nunderstand them you need a friend to take you through it. Ostensibly,\nweb sites are supposed to be clear enough that anyone can use them, but\nfor most of them you need a friend to show you how it\u2019s done.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t realize the importance of friendship networks.\nThey think the world largely works the way it\u2019s ostensibly supposed to.\nYou do good work, you follow the rules, you get noticed, you get the\nbenefits. And when they fail to succeed or comprehend, it\u2019s probably\nbecause they\u2019re stupid or somebody isn\u2019t following the system. But it\u2019s\nneither of those, it\u2019s the system that\u2019s stupid \u2014 you don\u2019t succeed\nthrough hard work, you succeed through friendship networks.\n\nThis has clear implications for one\u2019s personal behavior: when you want\nto do something, don\u2019t follow the rules but look for a friend. (Sure,\nyou could stay in a New York hotel \u2014 but you\u2019d be much better off\nsleeping on the floor of a friend.) And build up lots of friends so that\nyou\u2019ll be able to call on them when you need them. (Find a book you\nreally like? Send the author a friendly note.)\n\nBut it also has systematic implications. Because our friendship networks\nare so skewed towards other\u2019s like us, making things dependent of\nfriendship networks serves as a subtle form of discrimination and\nexclusion. A stranger in the middle of Nebraska will have a hard time\nlearning Geology because they don\u2019t know any geologists. A writer living\ndeep in Kansas will have a hard time getting their work published\nbecause few of the publishers have ever heard of them.\n\nThere are two ways to fight this. One is to be more generous about\nfinding friends. Get to know random people who email you, talk to people\non the plane or at the theater, take part in activities that go beyond\nyour typical location and social stratum.\n\nBut these techniques can only go so far \u2014 despite my best efforts, I\u2019ll\nnever be able to even consider being friends with the vast majority of\nthe world\u2019s population. The better option is to help move things from\nfriendship networks to ostensible networks, to document the cool places\nin New York City, to start websites where you can [find people to stay\nwith](http://www.couchsurfing.com/), to not automatically give jobs and\nperks to friends, to build things clear enough that anyone can use them.\n\nSure, it can be hard to say no to a friend. But wouldn\u2019t you want\nsomeone to extend you the same courtesy?\n", "external_links": ["http://www.couchsurfing.com/"], "time": 1163836800.0, "postid": "ostensiblenetworks", "internal_links": []}, "soundsmart": {"post_title": "That Sounds Smart", "tags": [], "post_content": "That Sounds Smart\n=================\n\nJune 18, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/soundsmart)\n\n* * * * *\n\nHow do you tell if what someone is saying is smart? Most people\u2019s first\ninstinct is to think that things they can\u2019t understand must be smart.\nAfter all, to say such things they must have learned them and aren\u2019t\npeople who have learned more about something generally smarter than\npeople who haven\u2019t? Thus the common phenomena of people trusting\njargon-laden statements.\n\nOne problem with this method is simply that jargon can be faked. It\u2019s\nnot too hard to make up a bunch of longish words that sound complicated.\nAnd if you don\u2019t understand them, you\u2019ll have a hard time telling\nwhether they\u2019re real or made up.\n\nBut the more serious problem is that this method is exactly backwards.\nSmart people actually say things that are very simple and easy to\nunderstand. And the smarter they are, the more clear what they say is.\nIt\u2019s stupid people who say things that are hard to understand.\n\nPart of this is because stupid people say things that aren\u2019t true,\nthings that aren\u2019t true don\u2019t make sense, and things that don\u2019t make\nsense are hard to understand. But you can also look at it from the other\nend: if you genuinely understand something \u2014 really, truly understand it\n\u2014 then it doesn\u2019t seem complicated and you can explain it rather simply.\n\nBut the larger consequence is that if you\u2019re smart the world doesn\u2019t\nseem very complicated. This might seem obvious, but the obvious thought\nis rather different. The obvious thought is: The world doesn\u2019t seem\ncomplicated to smart people. But this isn\u2019t what smart people actually\nthink. They think the world isn\u2019t complicated, period.\n\nThis is because when they try to explain part of the world they\nunderstand to someone, they explain it clearly, and, as a result, that\nperson now understands it. This is proof that it\u2019s not just\nuncomplicated for them, it\u2019s uncomplicated for everyone.\n\nBut, I suspect, for most people the world is a strange and mysterious\nplace, governed by principles they do not understand, which affect them\nseverely but cannot be controlled, only coped with as best as possible.\nThis is certainly how most people regard their computers.\n\nBy contrast, when I listen to smart people some part of the world I only\ndimly understood or never considered becomes immediately clear. Even if\nI don\u2019t agree, I never have any trouble understanding. Listening to\nthem, is like breathing pure oxygen and I cannot get enough.\n\nThis means the tradeoff between being expert and being popular doesn\u2019t\nactually exist. People who truly understand their subject should have no\ntrouble writing for a popular audience. And, in fact, their writing will\nprobably better than that of the professional popularizers.\n\nA good example of this was the early days of the blog Freakonomics. It\nhad two writers, a successful economist and a popular journalist. The\ntwo had worked together on the bestselling book of the same name, with\nthe general assumption that it was the journalist who had made the\neconomist\u2019s work clear. But reading their individual posts on the blog,\nyou could see it was the reverse: the economist was a much clearer\nwriter than the journalist.\n\nAnother result is that you find the really smart things in unexpected\nand undervalued places. Smart writing won\u2019t be in formal and\ndifficult-to-understand journal articles, but in the profanity-laced\nangry rants you\u2019ll find on someone\u2019s blog. That\u2019s where the smart people\nare, even if everybody else just thinks they\u2019re dumb.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1276844400.0, "postid": "soundsmart", "internal_links": []}, "ipad": {"post_title": "Is Apple Evil?", "tags": [], "post_content": "Is Apple Evil?\n==============\n\nJanuary 27, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ipad)\n\n* * * * *\n\nToday\u2019s iPad introduction has to be about the most depressing Apple\nproduct launch I\u2019ve ever watched.

The\nscariest thing is that I think it probably will. It\u2019s clear that Apple\nplans for the iPhone OS to be the future of its product line. And that\u2019s\nscary because the iPhone OS is designed for Apple\u2019s total control.\n\nA lot of people have argued that requiring Apple to approve every\napplication for the iPhone OS is some kind of \u201cmistake\u201d, something\nthey\u2019ll remedy as soon as they realize how bad things have gotten. But\nrecent events \u2014 Phil Schiller\u2019s personal interventions, comments on\ntheir call to analysts, etc. \u2014 have made it clear it\u2019s not a mistake at\nall. It\u2019s their plan.\n\nThe iPad is their attempt to extend this total control to what\u2019s\ntraditionally been thought of as the computer space. This is just the\nfirst step, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine Apple doing their best to phase\nout the Macintosh in the next decade, just as they phased out OS 9. In\ntheir ideal world, all computing will be done on the iPhone OS.\n\nAnd the iPhone OS will only run software that they specifically approve.\nNo Flash or other alternate runtimes, no one-off apps or open source\ncustomizations. Just total control by Apple. It\u2019s a frightening future.\n\nI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s hard to see how it makes them\nmore money. (Curating all those apps must be expensive, not to mention\nthe lost sales from the unapproved ones.) I can only presume it\u2019s a\nresult of Jobs\u2019 megalomaniacal need for control \u2014 not only does the\nhardware have to be flawless, the software must be too. And the only way\nto ensure that is to have Apple approve every inch of it.\n\nI love Apple products. I\u2019m a huge Apple fan. I\u2019d buy an iPad right now\nif I could.

Then came the amazing bit.\nDespite already having sold me a VPS and put a CPU cap on my usage of\nit, they manually edited my partition to add their SSH key to my\n`authorized_keys`, used that to **gain root on my box**, noticed that a\nCGI script was using up CPU, and responded by **turning off Apache**.\nThey didn\u2019t even try to call me to talk about it in advance. They didn\u2019t\neven call me at all. They just sent a little email. After the fact. The\nsubject? \u201cindex.cgi is causing high CPU usage\u201d\n\nI asked them what was going on.

After some contention, later economic studies\ntended to bare this out: a shortage of capital wasn\u2019t always the\nbottleneck, but when it was, removing it could lead to extraordinarily\nrapid growth.\n\nThe problem for poor countries is that, because of high mortality rates\n(which require more children to have some survive) and low educational\nlevels (which mean those children can find productive employment\nquickly), they have high population growth and thus low capital-to-labor\nratios. Worse, trade allows you to spend your money buying manufactured\ngoods from overseas, for which you have only your very cheap labor to\nprovide in return. The result is that it requires an enormous amount of\ndomestic investment to improve capital-to-labor ratios.\n\nAnd so rich country economists made \u201cthe neoliberal bet\u201d on behalf of\npoor countries: they hoped that loosening restrictions on international\ncapital flows would send capital rushing in to poor countries and build\ntheir economies, the same way that Great Britain\u2019s massive investment in\na young United States (in 1913 Britain\u2019s foreign assets equaled 60% of\nits domestic capital stock) built up that country.\n\nBut what ended up happening was exactly the opposite. Yes, NAFTA led US\ncompanies to invest the \\$20 to \\$30 billion a year on manufacturing in\nMexico that its boosters predicted, but that investment was more than\noutweighed by the \\$30 to \\$40 billion a year fleeing the country from\nMexico\u2019s wealthy wanting to invest it in the United States. Why? In part\nbecause the US was more politically stable, and thus a safer investment\nclimate. And in part because the US treats its own workers so poorly \u2014\nwith productivity rising 35% since 2000 while real wages remain flat \u2014\nit provides an excellent investment opportunity.\n\nBut meanwhile, all this investment in the US was dwarfed by the Chinese\nacquisition of our debt (and thus the political risk it represents).\nChina needed to do this, since US purchase of their exports is the only\nthing funding the manufacturing-led industrialization of a massive\nportion of their economy; there would be massive dislocation if that\nfunding dried up.\n\n\u201cRecognition of these facts came slowly.\u201d First, Larry Summers said it\nwas our unsustainable current account deficit. (That was the 1990s;\ntoday that deficit is four times as large.) Later, economists thought it\nmust have been our large budget deficits. Then they began thinking it\nwas the run-up in housing prices. But that, it is now clear to most\neconomists, was the result of a bubble. And yet the flow of capital to\nthe US continues.

The result is dozens\nof books (and even more papers) in three languages across four\nuniversities. And throughout, his work has not just been exemplary\nsocial science, but has always struggled with the question of what\nsocial science *should be* \u2014 what kinds of explanations are legitimate,\nwhich techniques should be used, and so on.\n\nAs he reaches his late sixties, it is understandable if he begins to\nthink of his legacy. That certainly would help explain his latest book,\n*Explaining Social Behavior: More Nuts and Bolts for the Social\nSciences* (Cambridge University Press, 2007), a 500-page masterpiece\nthat I expect will be seen as the summation of a brilliant career.\n\nIt\u2019s a book unlike any other and, as a result, unless read from start to\nfinish can seem bizarre, if only because one has little sense of what\nthe book is trying to do. It is not a guidebook, or a textbook, or a\npiece of social science in itself. In short, it is nothing less than an\nattempt to summarize an idealized vision of the whole of social science\nin simple language.\n\nThe book\u2019s foundational assumption (as implied by its title) is that the\ngoal of social science is to discover explanations for social phenomena.\nIt begins by describing what explanations are and discussing their\ndifferent forms. But the bulk of the book consists of tools that can be\nused in explanations: emotions, norms, time discounting, weakness of\nwill, magical thinking, cognitive dissonance, heuristics and biases,\nrationality, irrationality, neuroscience, evolution, externalities, game\ntheory, pluralistic ignorance, informational cascades, collective\naction, cyclical preferences, institutions, etc. \u2014 in short, the entire\ntoolkit of the social sciences.\n\nJust as amazing as the breadth topics is the way in which they\u2019re\ncovered. Elster explains each phenomenon clearly and concisely, so that\nany educated reader can understand them with little effort, without ever\nsacrificing intellectual depth. His explanations are peppered with\nexamples from an amazing variety of sources: ancient history, recent\nhistory, personal experience, the classics of social science (e.g.\nTocqueville), the great philosophers (Montaigne, Pascal, Mill), and\nclassic novelists (e.g. Proust). The result is a book which not just\nintroduces readers to the discoveries of the social sciences but to the\nintellectual world as a whole. Bibliographical notes following each\nchapter as well as the conclusion provide a rich guide for further\nexploration.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s not simply a compendium of interesting results in the\nsocial sciences, but attempts to defend a particular conception of what\nthe social sciences should be. In the conclusion, Elster defends his\nnotion of social science as the attempt to discover particular\nexplanations for particular phenomena against the \u201csoft obscurantism\u201d of\nthe literary theorists and the \u201chard obscurantism\u201d of the economists. As\npart of this, he turns his back on the notion of rational-choice models\nbeing an explanation in themselves, noting that their many assumptions\nare in desperate need of empirical defense.\n\nIn response to an earlier draft of this review, Elster wrote \u201cI\u2019m glad\nyou appreciate the details in my book, but you\u2019re missing the big\npicture, which is that there isn\u2019t any.\u201d Instead of trying to build a\nGrand Theory which explains all of social life, we should try to build\nexplanations of particular phenomena from the nuts and bolts we have\nlying around. And \u201ceven if a dominant explanation of a given event or\nepisode is discarded and then resurrected, the building blocks or\nmechanisms at work in the discarding and resurrection remain. The\nrepertory, or the size of the toolbox, does not shrink.\u201d\n\nFor anyone who cares about social science, Elster has done an amazing\nservice in clearly describing the toolbox\u2019s contents and defending its\nimportance.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521777445)\n\n*This is the first post of Elster week.*\n\n[image1_toolbox]: image1_toolbox.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521777445", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521777445"], "time": 1210489200.0, "postid": "toolbox", "internal_links": []}, "theoryofchange": {"post_title": "Theory of Change", "tags": [], "post_content": "Theory of Change\n================\n\nMarch 14, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and\nineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.\nTheory of change is a funny phrase \u2014 I first heard it in the nonprofit\ncommunity, but it\u2019s also widespread in politics and really applies to\njust about everything. Unfortunately, very few people seem to be very\ngood at it.\n\nLet\u2019s take a concrete example. Imagine you want to decrease the size of\nthe defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look\naround at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of\ndecreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a\nblog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your\nfriends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you\u2019re a professional\nwriter, you might write a book on the subject. If you\u2019re an academic,\nyou might publish some papers. Let\u2019s call this strategy a \u201ctheory of\naction\u201d: you work *forwards* from what you know how to do to try to find\nthings you can do that will accomplish your goal.\n\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action \u2014 it works\nbackwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can\ndo to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at\nthe end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u201cConcretely, how does one achieve\nthat?\u201d A decrease in the defense budget: how does one achieve that? Yes,\nyou.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Congress passes a new budget with a smaller\nauthorization for defense next year.\n\nYes, that\u2019s true \u2014 but let\u2019s get more concrete. How does that happen?\n\nAUDIENCE: Uh, you get a majority of the House and Senate to vote for it\nand the President to sign it.\n\nGreat, great \u2014 so how do you get them to do that? Now we have to think\nabout what motivates politicians to support something. This is a really\ntricky question, but it\u2019s totally crucial if we want to be effective.\nAfter all, if we don\u2019t eventually motivate the politicians, then what\nwe\u2019ve done is useless for achieving our goal. (Unless we can think of\nsome other way to shrink the defense budget.)\n\nBut this is also not an insoluble problem. Put yourself in the shoes of\na politician for a moment. What would motivate you? Well, on the one\nhand, there\u2019s what you think is right. Then there\u2019s what will help you\nget reelected. And finally there\u2019s peer pressure and other sort of\npsychological motivations that get people to do things that don\u2019t meet\ntheir own goals.\n\nSo the first would suggest a strategy of persuading politicians that\ncutting the defense budget was a good idea. The second would suggest\norganizing a constituency in their districts that would demand they cut\nthe defense budget. And maybe one of you can figure out how to use the\nthird\u2014that\u2019s a little trickier.\n\nBut let\u2019s stick with the first, since that\u2019s the most standard. What\nconvinces politicians that something is the right thing to do?\n\nAUDIENCE: Their beliefs?\n\nIn a sense, I suppose. But those are going to be pretty hard to change.\nI\u2019m thinking more, if you have a politician with a given set of beliefs,\nhow do you convince them that cutting the defense budget advances those\nbeliefs?\n\nAUDIENCE: You outline why to them.\n\nWell, OK, let\u2019s think about that. Do you think if you ran into Nancy\nPelosi in the hallway here and you tried to explain to her why cutting\nthe defense budget would accomplish her beliefs, that you\u2019d convince\nher?\n\nAUDIENCE: Probably not.\n\nWhy not?\n\nAUDIENCE: Because she wouldn\u2019t really listen to me \u2014 she\u2019d just smile\nand nod.\n\nYeah. Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t trust you. She\u2019s never met you. You\u2019re not\nparticularly credible. So you need to find people the politicians trust\nand get them to convince the politicians.\n\nAlright, well, we can continue down this road for a while \u2014 figuring out\nwho politicians trust, figuring out how to persuade *them*, figuring out\nhow to get them to, in turn, persuade the politicians, etc. Then, when\nthe politicians are persuaded, there\u2019s the task of developing something\nthey can vote for, getting it introduced so they can vote on it, then\ngetting them to vote on the specific measure even when they agree with\nthe overall idea. You can see that this can take quite a while.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. It could take a while before you get to a concrete action\nthat you can take. But do you see how this is entirely crucial if you\nwant to be effective? Now maybe if you\u2019re only writing a blog post, it\u2019s\nnot worth it. Not everything we do has to be maximally effective. But DC\nis filled with organizations that spend millions of dollars each year\nand have hardly even begun to think about these questions. I\u2019m not\nsaying their money is totally wasted \u2014 it certainly has some positive\nimpacts \u2014 but it could do so much more if the people in charge thought,\nconcretely, about how it was supposed to accomplish their goals.\n\nI\u2019ll close with one more example, showing how this strategy can be used\npersonally as well. I was at a party once and I told someone I was\nwriting a book and that I wanted it to be a bestseller. They laughed at\nthat and I think it\u2019s because they had a theory of action model in their\nhead: you write the best book you can, and of course you want it to be a\nbestseller, but either it does or it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut I was working backwards, I had a theory of change: I asked, What\nmakes something a best seller? Well, lots of people buy it. OK, how do\nyou get lots of people to buy something? Well, you have to persuade them\nit\u2019s something they want. OK, how do you persuade them it\u2019s something\nthey want? Well, first it has to meet some desire or need they have and\nsecond you need to explain to them how it meets that need. So what are\nthe desires or needs people have? (Looking at bestsellers:\nentertainment, escape, self-improvement, etc.) What are the ways of\nexplaining your book meets their need? (Being popular early on,\nappearances in the media, persuading readers to tell other readers,\netc.)\n\nAgain, we can keep going for quite a while until we get all the way back\nto something I can actually do. But because of this, I didn\u2019t have to\nsimply have to hope that my book became a bestseller, like every other\nauthor. I could actually do something about it.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of a theory of change.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1268553600.0, "postid": "theoryofchange", "internal_links": []}, "theafterparty": {"post_title": "The Afterparty", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Afterparty\n==============\n\nNovember 2, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theafterparty)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was Halloween, after all, so we donned costumes and headed to Harvard\nSquare. (\u201cWhat are you?\u201d people asked me. I looked them straight in the\neye, scrunched up my face to look a little angry, and said \u201cI\u2019m a\ndot-com millionaire\u201d with utter seriousness. That was my costume.)\nAlexis carried a sack of candy, Steve a sack of shirts. People in all\nsorts of bizarre costumes waited for the train.\n\nWe grabbed dinner at Border Cafe. Alexis handed out candy and shirts to\nthe waiters while flirting, and offered to bribe them into voting for\nhim in the Halloween costume contest.\n\nI ordered a meal, but couldn\u2019t make myself eat it. The food just sort of\nseemed to stick in my mouth, each swallow painful.\n\n\u201cSo what are you going to buy first?\u201d someone asked each of us. When it\ncame to me, I stared blankly. I couldn\u2019t think of anything I wanted.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for the check?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cOh, wait. I just\nrealized, for the first time, that it\u2019s relevant.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, we walked down Church Street back to Harvard Square. There\nwere a bunch of young girls loitering. Alexis struck up a conversation.\n\u201cWant some candy?\u201d \u201cYeah!\u201d they all cried. He opened up the pillowcase.\n\u201cWant some shirts?\u201d \u201cUh, sure,\u201d they laughed, and started fussing over\ncolors and sizes. It was the strangest transformation, two mild-mannered\nguys suddenly become showmen, a horde of girls at their feet. \u201cIt\u2019s\ntimes like these I wish I was a *Vanity Fair* reporter,\u201d I tell Chris.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s reddit?\u201d the girls asked as they tried shirts on. \u201cOh, it used\nto be a website.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why are you girls all just standing here?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the\n*Rocky Horror Picture Show*! You should come.\u201d \u201cOh. Well, we were going\nto go get crunked.\u201d \u201cWell, you can get crunked and then come see it!\u201d\n\nWe demurred and continued on, finding a flock of well-suited men,\nvisiting from other countries, who fell for the same trick. \u201cI\u2019ll have\nto give this to my daughter.\u201d\n\nAs we walked to a bar, we passed three young girls in bunny costumes who\nAlexis tried to pick up. The oldest-looking one wanted to hang out with\nus, thought it would be fun, started giggling suggestively, a glimmer\ninto a pasttime I didn\u2019t understand (my feeling is \u201cmen suck\u201d, on both\nsides of the equation). But despite her best efforts, her two\nyounger-looking friends shied away and wanted to just go to *Rocky\nHorror*. There was a struggle, and I saw the girls walking towards the\nbar and away from it several times after that.\n\nBy the time we finally reached the bar, my head was pounding and my\nstomach was nauseous, and I didn\u2019t want to go in, I didn\u2019t want to be\nhere, I didn\u2019t want to know these people. I went home instead and\nwatched a show about a serial killer and found myself identifying with\nthe lead.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, my head was fuzzy. And while I saw the\ncostumes strewn about the floor, the girls brought home who slept in our\nliving room, the odd emails asking me what I\u2019d do next, I still felt\nfunny. For a shining moment in the morning, it felt as if this whole\nacquisition thing might have simply been a dream.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1162454400.0, "postid": "theafterparty", "internal_links": []}, "hotgirlsyndrome": {"post_title": "Hot Girl Syndrome", "tags": ["sociology"], "post_content": "Hot Girl Syndrome\n=================\n\nJuly 31, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hotgirlsyndrome)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the more thought-provoking CollegeHumor videos was their\n(exaggerated) [attempt to imagine the inner life of an attractive\nwoman](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1900432). One of the things it\nmakes clear is that being a hot girl means a constant stream of positive\nfeedback: guys turn to smile at you, they laugh loudly at all your\njokes, they\u2019re always eager to do favors. The world just seems to bend\nitself to your desires.\n\nOne might think that such a constant stream of positive attention would\nmake you particularly confident and resilient, but the human mind\ndoesn\u2019t work that way; it adapts to its environment. Constant positive\nattention doesn\u2019t make you less dependent on praise any more than\nconstant eating makes you less dependent on food. When someone comes\nalong and says something mean, you don\u2019t fall back on your years of\npositive experiences and decide to ignore them. Instead, you\u2019re so\nshocked by the experience that you come away deeply wounded.\n\nI think I first realized this when I visited a well-known author. He\u2019d\nwritten several highly-regarded books which received apparently\nunanimous praise. If someone\u2019s ever criticized him for something, I\u2019ve\nnever seen it. Yet, when I saw him, he told me he\u2019d been feeling down\nfor nearly a week. Why? Because a reader from Australia sent him a nasty\nemail. The endless praise hadn\u2019t made him more resilient; it had made\nhim unusually vulnerable.\n\nI think this explains why the pick-up artist\u2019s technique of the \u201cneg\u201d \u2014\na minor offhand insult intended to dent a girl\u2019s self-esteem \u2014 is so\nparticularly effective, especially on unusually attractive women. For\npeople who aren\u2019t used to being insulted, even a minor insult carries a\npowerful sting. (A major insult would probably be too strong, though.\nThey\u2019d be too hurt to want to even associate with you.)\n\nAnother thing made clear in the video is that bidding for a girl\u2019s\naffections is typically a kind dollar auction. A dollar auction is an\nauction where both the highest bidder *and* the second-higest bidder\nhave to pay (even though only the highest bidder gets the prize).\nRational behavior in a dollar auction isn\u2019t particularly clear \u2014 if\nyou\u2019re the second-highest bidder, it always seems to make sense to bid a\nlittle more, since you\u2019ll lose the same amount of money but at least get\nto take home the prize. But if you keep doing that, you soon find\nyourself paying ridiculously large amounts for something you might not\neven get.\n\nWith girls, there isn\u2019t a formal auction, but instead guys bid by buying\nher things, with no promise that they\u2019ll get anything in return. Since\nthe things you\u2019ve already spent so much, it always seems sensible to\nspend a little more to get the girl. The result, from the girl\u2019s\nperspective, is that people are falling over themselves to buy you\nthings without you having to give them anything in return.\n\nPerhaps the safest way to win a dollar auction is not to play at all.\nAnd, indeed, this was [Richard Feynman\u2019s surprising finding with women\nas well](http://www.gorgorat.com/#35). He takes the advice of the bar\u2019s\nMC to refuse to buy girls anything until \u201cyou\u2019ve *asked* her if she\u2019ll\nsleep with you, and you\u2019re convinced that she *will*, and that she\u2019s not\nlying.\u201d (Feynman is taken aback by the suggestion: \u201cUh\u2026 you mean\u2026 you\ndon\u2019t\u2026 uh\u2026 you just *ask* them?\u201d)\n\nBut it works, and no doubt Hot Girl Syndrome is part of the reason why.\nWhen everyone is falling all over themselves for you, the only person\nyou have to impress is the one guy who isn\u2019t.\n\nThe application to politics is left as an exercise for the reader.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1900432", "http://www.gorgorat.com/#35"], "time": 1249023600.0, "postid": "hotgirlsyndrome", "internal_links": []}, "gettingpast": {"post_title": "Getting Past", "tags": [], "post_content": "Getting Past\n============\n\nFebruary 8, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingpast)\n\n* * * * *\n\nHe called me into his office.

And with the help of another high\nschool friend, programmer Nick Nassar, they begun developing\nsoftware-based websites like [Blog\nTorrent](http://www.blogtorrent.com/), designed to make sharing files\nthrough BitTorrent as easy as posting to a blog.\n\nWith little more than a computer in the attic of Nick\u2019s parents\u2019 house,\nthey became a major force in the Internet copyright debate. Cory\nDoctorow lavished praise on their youthful humor and energy (\u201cone of the\nbest, most effective group of copyfighters on the net, fast turning into\na MoveOn for the P2P wars,\u201d [he once called\nthem](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/14/bountyraising_for_en.html),\n\u201cmy favorite gang of take-no-prisoners\ncopyfighters[\u201d](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/22/get_paid_to_write_co.html))\nand Larry Lessig begun denouncing their \u201cextremism\u201d (the anti-copyright\nanalog, he argued, of those who think everything should be copyrighted\nforever) in speeches, positioning himself as a centrist between such\nextremists.\n\nAnd Downhill Battle continued to grow, launching two more non-profits \u2014\nthe Participatory Politics Foundation, which develops the kind of\npolitical technology hacks in a way I once dreamed of doing myself\n(current projects include [a Slashdot-style news site for\npolitics](http://theregular.org/) and [a website for tracking current\ncongressional legislation](http://opencongress.org/)), and the\nParticipatory Culture Foundation, which is [developing a Internet TV\nplatform](http://participatoryculture.org/) which will let anyone start\ntheir own television network (delivered over BitTorrent) which can be\neasily downloaded from a GUI player (Al Gore\u2019s cable channel and the\nSEIU, among others, have already signed on to provide content).\n\nWith the non-profits came actual funding \u2014 up to then, the thing was\nfunded by meager merchandise sales, savings, and living cheaply\n(including living out of their parents\u2019 houses and buying clothes from\nthe Salvation Army) \u2014 and stuff that seemed more like actual work:\ngiving presentations to funders, calling people to invite them to\nprovide content for the TV platform, and so on. No more dashing off web\npages attacking major media corporations, now it\u2019s a long slog toward\nshipping, all under the guise of professionalism. But it\u2019s not like\nthey\u2019ve started wearing suits or anything\u2026\n\n(And now they want *you* to [join\nthem](http://participatoryculture.org/jobs/)! What a sweet job that\nwould be\u2026)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nTiffiniy\u2019s friend is also visiting from Vermont this weekend and the\nTiffiniy decides to take us all on a little tour of Worcester. Worcester\nis an odd city. It\u2019s an hour away from Boston, yet it looks just like\npart of the city, not a suburb. But despite looking like a city \u2014 blocks\nand blocks of retail and business and things \u2014 the streets are\ncompletely empty. And while it contains several colleges, it doesn\u2019t\nfeel at all like a college town. And \u2014 and maybe this last part is just\nthe Downhill Battle guys \u2014 but everything looks like it\u2019s from the 70s.\n\nTiffiniy\u2019s apartment, for example, has old draped couches and tables,\nsinks and stoves \u2014 even [the new\nbooks](http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100956870)\nhave retro covers. And the first place Tiffiniy took us was an old\nshopping mall where they considered buying office space (they needed a\nplace to invite bands, they claim) and the whole thing looks run-down\nand wooden. Then we head to a hot El Salvadoran restaurant that\nsimilarly seems like a throwback. And, of course, all of them dress in\nretro clothes.\n\nAt the restaurant, Holmes shows up on his skateboard (also giving me a\nhug) and getting really into the soccer match playing on the TV.\nHolmes\u2019s girlfriend mentions she\u2019s getting a tattoo of a Jimmy Corrigan\nbird on her arm (Holmes\u2019s sister, I noticed, has the Tristero logo) and\nHolmes asks me if I\u2019ve read Jimmy Corrigan. \u2018No,\u2019 I reply. \u2018Oh, you have\nto,\u2019 he insists. I say I want to, that I\u2019ve read some of Chris Ware\u2019s\nother stuff and I really enjoyed it \u2014 in fact, I saw him do the most\namazing thing with Ira Glass. The whole table groans (with the except of\nTiffiniy\u2019s friend, the other visitor). \u2018Ira Glass is a such a jerk!\u2019\nthey insist and I get into a long argument about Ira Glass, who I\nactually really like, but they argue saps all political meaning out of\nlife.\n\n\u2018The whole point of Ira Glass,\u2019 Holmes explains, \u2018is so that some yuppie\nsitting in their car can listen to some sappy story about a girl who\nlost their dog and think that now they\u2019ve experienced what it really\nmeans to live in America. The show makes no distinction between\nwhatsoever betweem whatever little yuppie bullshit their average\nlistener has to put up with and the real societal problems that face\nAmerica. Whether they\u2019re talking about silly kid or about gun control,\nit\u2019s the same stupid background music, the same smarmy tone.\u2019\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAmerican University is hosting the Free Culture conference (they\u2019re the\nones with the Ford Foundation funding) and they\u2019re ferrying us all from\nthe hotel to the campus in a series of cabs. Inside an innocuous-looking\nbuilding at the center of the AU campus, they\u2019ve taken out a whole room\nand done it all up with fancy lighting and real caterers.\n\nI try to get around and chat. Colin Mutchler, an artist and and activist\nwho is hosting the discussion, made waves the past year with his [Free\nCulture Tour](http://www.activefreemedia.org/tour/) in which he traveled\nthe country performing on the subject of copyright law and things like\nCreative Commons. He repeats the presentation for us (it includes, I was\nlater told, a photo of me wearing a CC shirt to represent Creative\nCommons \u2014 I noticed the CC logo but somehow missed the fact that it was\nme wearing it!) and it\u2019s amazing. For some reason, I find spoken word\nincredibly powerful in a real, visceral way.\n\nAfterwards, the apparently famed [DJ\nRekha](http://sangament.com/djrekha/) took over and the Downhill Battle\npeople cleared out some space and started dancing away, eventually\ndrawing others in to join them. I tried to but couldn\u2019t shake my\nself-consciousness.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nBack at Tiffiniy\u2019s apartment, Holmes is carrying his girlfriend, who is\nnot feeling well, inside. Tiffiniy is hanging out with her visiting\nfriend and so I head with Nick to a place he calls \u201cthe collective\u201d,\nwhich sounds interesting enough for me to get in the car without asking\nfurther questions. The collective\u2019s full name, as it turns out, is\n\u201cCollective \u00e1 Go-Go\u201d and Nick explains that while his friend Jake is on\ntour with his band, he\u2019s staying in Jake\u2019s room there.\n\nAs we drive Worcester becomes increasingly less city-like, its tall\nblocks fading into strip malls and then disappearing altogether, leaving\nhouses surrounded by trees. Eventually we pull into the drive way of one\nespecially large house and cut the engine. As I step out, the first\nthing that hits me is the overwhelming silence. The place is beautiful,\ntucked into luscious green woods.\n\nThe house tries to be mostly self-sufficient. Water is taken from a\nnearby reservoir but is heated by hand over a stove powered by firewood\nwhich they cut to size themselves (the wood itself comes from a tree\nremoval service). In lieu of bathrooms, they run their own composting\nprocess. They have a garden where they grow some food, the rest is\nbought from local organic farms. Chores (of which there are a lot, Nick\nsays) are shared equally.\n\nIn fact, we\u2019re here now to help chop firewood. Nick tries to show me how\nto chop the wood down to size by hand with a thing that looks like an\naxe (but blunter, Nick says). As you might expect, I\u2019m terrible at it.\nWe eventually pull out the heavy duty wood-cutting machine, in which a\nhydraulic piston pushes the wood through the axe blade. Even this is\nsomething of a challenge, since the wood has a tendency to try to jump\nup and get stuck and other such things.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising how few people I know at this party. People keep having\nto explain other people to me.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nAfter chopping wood, Nick shows me around the collective. The garage\nhouses a full silk screening system, which is where they make the\nDownhill Battle tees. Jake used to be in charge and then Holmes\u2019s\ngirlfriend, who used to live here, begun helping out. Jake calls on the\nphone and Nick talks to him for a bit, asking how the tour is going.\n\nInside, Nick introduces me to some of the other collective members and\nthey talk a bit more about Jake. And then, a thought hits me. \u2018This\nisn\u2019t Jake *Berendes*, is it?\u2019 I say. Nick looks taken aback. \u2018You know\nJake Berendes?\u2019 \u2018Well, I know of him.\u2019 \u2018How?\u2019 \u201cMy friend Leonard\nRichardson is always making jo\u2014\u201d \u2018Oh, you know Leonard! Wow, that\u2019s\nincredible.\u2019 The fact that I knew of Jake Berendes quickly became the\nmost interesting thing about me and Nick eagerly told everyone.\n\n\u2018Indeed,\u2019 I said, \u2018sometimes Leonard needs to [assure people that Jake\nis a real person](http://www.crummy.com/2005/04/21/1)!\u2019 \u2018Jake doesn\u2019t\nsound like a real person?\u2019 laughs a collective member with an air that\nsuggests sometimes Jake can be all-too-real. \u2018Not the way Leonard tells\nit,\u2019 I reply.\n\n[Aside: To discuss Jake Berendes would not only be going far beyond my\narea of knowledge but also to delve into a strange world of [magical\nrealism](http://www.crummy.com/articles/jake_berendes_west_covina/),\n[amateur music](http://crummy.com/music/), [nested\nin-jokes](http://www.xorph.com/jake_berendes_west_covina/), [Repetitive\nElectronic\nMusic](http://www.corleonerecords.com/catmore.asp?release=42 \"Ordem E Progresso\"),\nand [giant squid](http://www.fujichia.com/stuffed/squids/). Not that\nthat\u2019s a bad thing.]\n\nNick takes me up to Jake\u2019s room. \u201cJake is the most creative person I\nknow,\u201d Nick says. Every day he writes [a weblog\nentry](http://www.fujichia.com/index1.html) and [makes a stuffed\nanimal](http://www.fujichia.com/stuffed), he writes numerous songs,\ndraws, makes posters, puts together zines, and on and on. It is truly\nincredible. Nick gives me a CD to take home.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe university kicks us out at what seems like an unreasonably early\nhour and we head outside to wait in the cold for the cabs that are\nsupposed to take us back to our hotel. Nobody shows up for what seems\nlike forever until a stationwagon finally arrives. Desperate, we decide\nto all pile in; the Downhill Battle people and me all lying together in\nthe trunk. Someone snaps a photo. \u201cNo rich metadata!\u201d Holmes cries. \u2018You\ncan post it but I don\u2019t want it to be found by searching for my name.\u2019\n\nWe realize, piled into the trunk of a cabbie\u2019s stationwagon, that the\nnight is still young. We decide to ask the cabbie to drop us uptown near\nsome bars. I ask Holmes if they\u2019re sure they want me along, but Holmes\nis nothing if not accommodating and thinks we\u2019ll be able to make it work\nout. When the cabbie drops us off, Holmes stops someone on the street\nand asks him if he can recommend any bars I might be able to sneak into.\n\u2018Not a chance!\u2019 says the guy.\n\nUndeterred, we head to the first bar we spot. One of the Battlers has a\nrecently-expired ID whose photo looks a decent amount like me and I give\nit to the bouncer. He looks at it for a second and then lets me in. The\nactual battler holds back for a while and enters with the real ID soon\nafter.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time in a bar and, like most such firsts, it is inevitably\ndisappointing. It looks much like any other restaurant. It\u2019s quite\nstylish, with globe lights and fake branches as plants. The waitress\ntakes some orders and the music pounds. We sit in a booth and chat with\nour neighbors.\n\nI first met Holmes at [a party hosted by Zack\nRosen](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001645) months ago. Zack, who\nlooked so at home when he was at a party\u2026well, at home, now looks sort\nof out-of-place, like I often feel at parties. Unfortunately he\u2019s too\nfar to talk to.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nBack at Tiffiniy\u2019s apartment, they\u2019re inflating a new raft. We all take\nturns getting lightheaded on hyperventilating over plastic fumes. We\nthrow the raft on top of the car, each grabbing a side, and drive to the\ntop of a hill overseeing a lake. Nick throws the raft onto the hill and\nwe take turns sliding it down (it\u2019s not a very steep hill). We throw the\nraft into the mud surrounding the lake. For a moment it looks like I\u2019m\ngoing to go with Tiffiniy\u2019s friend, but this mistake is quickly\nrectified and I hang back with Tiffiniy until its our turn.\n\nThe sun is setting and the lake and trees are all drawn in pale blues\nand greens. The lake is like a shimmering mirror, the yellow raft\nhanging in the middle. When its our turn Tiffiniy goes in first and I go\nin after but end up slipping in the mud, falling on top of her, getting\nwater in the boat, and getting myself all swampy. We embark anyway,\nusing brooms brought from the apartment as paddles. The mood is slightly\nruined, as are my clothes.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe law school graduate fighting medicine patents is rather obviously\nhitting on Nick. \u2018*Tell me your dreams*\u2019, she says lusciously. \u2018Well,\nuh,\u2019 Nick replies, stiff and nervous, \u2018our group tries to fight, uh, the\nexpansion of, uh, copyright law by\u2014\u2019. \u2018*No*\u2019, she interrupts. \u2018*Not the\ngroup\u2019s dreams \u2014 your dreams*.\u2019 \u2018Oh. Well, uh.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve left the bar and are now walking the streets in search of dancing,\nalthough we can\u2019t quite seem to remember the name of the place we\u2019re\nheading for. Captain something, perhaps? Oh, there it is. We try to pull\noff the ID trick again, but we\u2019re foiled by the \\$5 cover charge. \u201cFive\ndollars!\u201d someone exclaims. We head back to regroup. Law school girl\nheads in to see if she can pull out a friend.\n\nHer friend is a shortish snobbish fellow, with a manner that was the\nsubject of much derision but which is rather hard to describe. \u2018Oh, boy,\nthere\u2019s sure a lot of you. Well, uh, I could probably get you and you in\n\u2014 who wants to actually get in? \u2014 yeah, you and you.\u2019 He looks at me.\n\u2018Sorry buddy, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gettin\u2019 you in.\u2019 Holmes decides\nthat maybe he doesn\u2019t want in and we head home, joking about what a jerk\nhe was. \u2018Please, you could get in,\u2019 he assures me.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nBack at Tiffiniy\u2019s apartment, they\u2019re cooking up some dinner. I\u2019ve taken\noff some of my more swampy clothes, borrowing some of Tiffiniy\u2019s pants.\nAfterwards, we make plans to head over to a swimsuit-themed party. They\ncall up their friend programmer, who I will call Sam, and invite him to\ncome over. When Sam arrives, Nick suggests we discuss RSS, a prospect\nwhich Sam is not particularly enthusiastic about (and, to be honest,\nneither am I).\n\nWe apparently get to the swimsuit party a little too early, since nobody\nhas really arrived yet. We stand in a circle and talk for a bit with the\nlights on and then mill about for a little while. Topics for\nconversation are not particularly forthcoming. Sam tries to spark a new\none: \u2018I spent the day rereading *Ender\u2019s Game*,\u2019 he suggests. This\nsounds rather awkwardly geeky, but I can\u2019t help but chime in: \u2018Oh, I did\nthat once too! Just sat started looking at it and before I knew it I\u2019d\nreread the whole thing.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s *Ender\u2019s Game*?\u2019 asks one of the girls.\nWe\u2019re apparently the only two who know.\n\nSam is clearly socially awkward so it doesn\u2019t surprise me too much when\na little later he announces that he\u2019s heading home. But it does surprise\nthe Downhill Battle folks. Word spreads that apparently Sam was asked to\nleave, which strikes me as a little much. I mean, he obviously wasn\u2019t a\nparty person, but to throw him out?\n\nIt turns out that things are much stranger than that. In fact, Sam\u2019s\nex-girlfriend who broke up with Sam after cheating on him, is coming\nover soon and apparently they don\u2019t think he should be around for it.\nHolmes thinks this is monumentally unfair and, he later tells us, he\nseeks out the girl who asked Sam to leave and gets in her face. \u2018Maybe\nnext time you could tell me in advance who I can and can\u2019t bring to your\nparties,\u2019 he tells her.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been watching the OC a lot,\u2019 he later explains, \u2018and on that show\nif someone has a beef with someone else they just go right there and\ntell them. The Worcester scene\u2019s too small for people to be having beefs\nlike this; it\u2019s noxious. We just need to get this all out into the open.\nWe could have a Worcester beef wiki. You know, you\u2019ve got to write up\neverybody you\u2019ve got a beef with.\u2019\n\nSo at the party, he just kept staying on the girl, asking her why Sam\ncouldn\u2019t stay and what the problem is and she repeatedly declined to\ncomment. \u2018They\u2019re never going to invite you back,\u2019 someone comments.\n\u2018Oh, I knew that,\u2019 Holmes says. \u2018I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to go back\nif that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to be.\u2019\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe Ford Foundation, foolishly, did not bring us all out here simply to\nhang out and party. Instead, they\u2019ve provided what I assume is the\nstandard summit garb: a long white U-shaped conference table with a\nprojector at one end along which we can type on our laptops while\nsharing insights. Such sessions are certainly popular, but I\u2019m not sure\nhow effective they (as opposed to the discussions outside them) really\nare.\n\nThe last major one I went to was a alternative [music] compensation\nsystem (ACS) meeting hosted by Harvard Law\u2019s Terry Fisher. I took\ncopious notes of the discussion, which Terry suggested I not post on my\nblog, but those don\u2019t seem to have been worth anything and instead what\nI remember is being snowed into the Sheraton Commander with Ed Felten\nand Ernest Miller and friends.\n\nOne problem is that such events have rather unclear goals, like\n\u201cfostering discussion\u201d. One can certainly have a conversation \u2014 two,\nmaybe even three or four, people talking to each other \u2014 and one can\nhave many such conversations. But one cannot have conversations\ninvolving groups of twenty or thirty people, especially when the topic\nis boring and the people are prone to speeches. It\u2019s just doesn\u2019t work.\nThe only useful part, as the participants will readily attest, is the\nconversations in the hallways.\n\nStill, you obviously want to go to such summits, if only for the\nprestige and fun of hanging out with such cool people. And something\nabout such meetings seems to compress people, making them into more\nconcentrated coolness than normally. Hanging out with the amazing Ed\nFelten at the ACS meeting led me to go home and apply to Princeton\n(where he teaches) and, as we will see later in this story, hanging out\nwith the Downhill Battle people had a similar effect.\n\nAnd so, I\u2019m in something of a bind, since I want to get invited to such\nmeetings but I don\u2019t really like them. So I can\u2019t really talk about them\nmuch on my blog. Nor can I tell the organizer what I really think about\nthem, although they always ask. And worst of all, I sort of tune out\nduring the actual meeting-part conversations which makes me shy about\nspeaking up lest I betray this fact, which in turn makes the organizer\nregret inviting me. \u2018I invited this Aaron kid because I thought he was a\ngenius,\u2019 they say to themselves, \u2018but he didn\u2019t say a word!\u2019 (As a last\nditch attempt to justify flying me out they try to pressure me into\nsaying something but I\u2019m not very cooperative.) It\u2019s all so sad.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWinnetka, Illinois \u2014 Ninth Grade\n\nBut perhaps not as sad as me at a party. In junior high and high school\nwe would routinely have what the school insisted on calling \u201csocials\u201d \u2014\nbasically dance parties. I was practically alone in almost never showing\nup and my classmates, who showed the same surprising social generosity I\nsee in the Downhill Battle Kids, went so far as to start bribing me to\ncome.\n\nEven when I did come I mostly stood in the corner, perhaps twitching\noccasionally, maybe talking to some people. During a slow dance a girl\nfinally grabbed me from the corner (perhaps even ditching her date) and\npulled me out to the floor, putting her hands on my shoulders, as was\nthe custom. I reacted, naturally, by putting my hands on her shoulders\nbut a within a few seconds noticed this was quite wrong and that all the\nother men had their hands on either side of their partner\u2019s waist, so I\nquickly corrected myself. I still had no idea what to do with my feet,\nbut to my recollection I didn\u2019t do anything incredibly stupid with them,\nbut I can\u2019t say the moment was particularly enjoyable, seeing as how I\nwas gripped with fear the whole time.\n\nFurther bribes led me to try to participate in the bizarre actions that\nseem to make up modern \u201cdance\u201d, which make my twitching look tame by\ncomparison. Dance has never really made a whole lot of sense to me, but\nits modern version is surely especially odd, consisting as it does\nmostly of people huddling close together and sort of writhing and\nshaking various appendages in some vague relation to the music.\n\nThe worst thing about it, however, is that stupid as it is you can do it\npoorly and look even stupider. And, as you might expect, falling from\nsuch an already low level could leave one\u2019s self-esteem at rather\nperilous lows. So in dancing, one tries to keep a sense of just how\nstupid one looks at this moment, in order to determine whether to cease\nsuch activity. Unfortunately for one, however, it is precisely this\nself-conscious monitoring that is the primary cause of poor dancing.\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts \u2014 Present Day\n\nTaking all this into account, I am sitting alone at a table in the\nkitchen with a neckache while dancing grows in the other room and people\nstart smoking pot on the porch. Holmes, frustrated with the stereo\nsystem, has commandeered it and attached it to an iBook and is now\ndownloading songs to play off a peer-to-peer network. Once he feels he\nhas sufficient songs queued up he comes over and sits down with me.\n\n\u2018Are you OK with just sitting here?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Because I want to know if\nI should pressure you to come join us and I know there are some people\nwho are just totally OK with who they are.\u2019 I\u2019m rather surprised at the\nquestion and not really sure about how to articulate my feelings. \u2018Well,\num,\u2019 I say. \u2018No, then. If you have any question about it, then the\nanswer is no.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I finally say. \u2018Right now, this person I am right\nnow, has no desire to go dancing. But I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I\nshould be a different sort of person.\u2019\n\nThis too apparently means no and Holmes drags me into the other room and\nI slowly begin twitching again, expanding until I reach a range which\nmight be considered moderate dancing, which I still am not doing very\nwell at. Holmes and friends decide to liven up the party but running\ninto a mattress that\u2019s laid up against the wall a high speeds, causing\nthem to bounce off of it and into the crowd. I decide to join in and\nit\u2019s the first fun thing I\u2019ve done all night.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOne of the cooler groups here are the folks from Third World Majority\n(website [cultureisaweapon.org](http://cultureisaweapon.org/), who\nmanage to combine some of the most radical rants with support for the\npower of technology. The tech industry, as Thomas Frank superbly\ndocuments (notably in *One Market Under God*), consists mostly of\nradical politics as sham \u2014 letting 20-year-old kids run companies is\nsupposed to replace economic democracy \u2014 but TWM has radical politics as\nextreme as anything I\u2019ve seen.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nA dark-skinned youth in what I guess are called hip hop clothes enters\nthe party. He wasn\u2019t invited, he admits readily, but he saw the noise\nand decided to come by. Back in Illinois, I\u2019d have to say, they\u2019d\nprobably be trying to kick the kid out right about now, but these\nWorcester kids just toss him a beer. Conversation with him is perhaps a\nlittle strained, but there\u2019s no overt tension.\n\nHe invites a few of his friends over (which is probably exactly what the\nIllinois kids were afraid of) and while for the most part they associate\namong themselves, nobody seems to mind them.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAside from the Downhill Battle folks, the coolest person here is Hannah\nSasserman of the [Prometheus Radio\nProject](http://www.prometheusradio.org/). Prometheus, [profiled in *The\nNation*\u2019s radio\nissue](http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20050523&s=karr),\nstarted as a collective that started illegal \u201cpirate\u201d radio stations.\nThe group has lately gone legit, lobbying for the legalization of\nLow-Power FM (LPFM) stations and building community radio stations\ninstead of pirate ones. Hannah is intelligent and articulate and\npassionate and good at balancing the legal and illegal sides of her job.\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely one to watch,\u201d I wrote a friend afterwards.\n\nA professor asks if some students can practice by filming us and Hannah\ncomments by saying something about them filming her ass. \u2018It\u2019s not\nsupposed to be X-rated,\u2019 the professor explains. \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry,\u2019\nHannah replies. \u2018My ass is not X-rated.\u2019\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nBack at the Tiffiniy\u2019s apartment, my neck still hurts, the pain crawling\nup towards my head as it usually does. As the party went on people begin\ntaking off their clothes, revealing the swimsuits underneath (it was a\nswimsuit party, after all). Even Holmes strips down to some\ntight-fitting swimming trunks. Some of the girls even started swapping\nswimsuits. I think I finally understand what Aimee Mann meant when she\nsang \u201ctrading clothes and ringing Pavlov\u2019s Bell\u201d.\n\nWe left probably around probably 4am. (I remember I once was at a rather\ngeekier party and I was introduced to Miguel de Icaza. Miguel and I\nreally didn\u2019t have all that much to talk about, so he started flipping\nhis sexy cell phone open and closed and telling me about the dance\nparties he went to. Where he was from, he told me, the music didn\u2019t even\n*start* until 4am!)\n\nI ask if there\u2019s any aspirin for my head and they tell me that the\nsolution to headaches is to drink some water and eat stuff. I try this\nbut tell them that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work and when I don\u2019t\ntake aspirin in response to a neckache I generally end up waking in the\nmiddle of the night with a searing pain tearing apart my skull. After\nrepeating this story several times in a rather subdued tone, they kindly\nget some aspirin from the local 24-hour pharmacy.\n\nHolmes arrives later and debriefs us about the night, giving the above\nriff about the OC, which leads to a discussion about how things are much\nbetter on television. \u2018You know what else is good about the OC? The kids\njust totally ignore the parents. You want to go visit someone? You drive\nover there and next thing you know you\u2019re in their bedroom.\u2019 I suggest\nthat another good thing about the OC is that you get places instantly,\nbut Holmes assures me that the show\u2019s realism includes actual driving.\n\nEventually we go to sleep \u2014 I\u2019m allowed to use the bed out on the\nglass-enclosed second-floor back porch.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAfter the day\u2019s long meeting we\u2019re taken on a bus to a crowded fancy\nrestaurant. We\u2019re stored in three tables up in the top floor\u2019s corner.\nAt one point I have to go down to the bathroom and I swear it looks just\nlike the choreographed office number from *Brazil*: people in colorful\nclothing go up and down the stairs, a waiter with a tray cuts in front\nof me, a scenic view from the second floor over a crowded restaurant,\npeople pass pieces of paper back and forth in front of me, all while a\nperfectly steady camera shot takes it all in.\n\nBack at the table, I sit next to Tiffiniy. She says she\u2019s not feeling\nvery well so she sort of slouches down in her chair quite a bit and to\nkeep talking to her I slouch down and do face the same way. While we\u2019re\noblivious, someone snaps [a\nphoto](http://www.flickr.com/photos/activefree/15723535/in/photostream/)\nand laughs and shows it to us. It looks like we\u2019re swooningly in love.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nI wake up to the sun streaming through the glass ceiling. I get up and\nspend an hour just sort of staring at my hands. Later I head in and we\ngo out to breakfast.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAfter dinner a fellow from the Consumers Union (nonprofit publisher of\n*Consumer Reports*, although they\u2019re actually much more political than\nthat would suggest) invites us over to his house, which looks a little\nlike the kind of old abandoned places that people throw wild parties at\nin movies. He hasn\u2019t been letting the place go to waste though \u2014 he\ninstalled a large stripper pole in the middle of the living room.\n\nSome loud music is put on and I head out to the back porch to escape it.\nHolmes decides to take a seat and as water starts squirting out from\nunder him, he realizes he\u2019s sat in a puddle. He takes off his pants and\nthrows them on the nearby barbecue, where they proceed to start\nsteaming. It looks like smoke, of course, and one wonders what the\nneighbors think when they come out on their porch and observe us.\n\nThe Downhill Battle kids have brought their skateboards and we take\nturns trying them, the more adventurous racing down the hill. Just the\ndriveway\u2019s tilt is too much for me \u2014 things go too fast and I arch my\nback and scrape my wrist and knee.\n\nI hang out with Tiffiniy on the front steps for a bit and then she grabs\nmy hand and drags me across the street and over a fence, up some stairs\ninto this amazing urban meadow between two houses that\u2019s been allowed to\nrun wild, grass growing tall and crawling up a defunct fountain in the\nmiddle. \u2018Isn\u2019t this beautiful?\u2019 she asks and indeed it is. After some\ntime we head back and some time after that she heads off with some\npeople to a bar. \u2018Do you want to come?\u2019 she asks and I do but I also\ndon\u2019t want to cause trouble again so I stay behind and head back to the\nhotel, looking at myself in the hotel\u2019s many mirrors, checking out how I\nlook in the tight-fitting Downhill Battle tee they gave me.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nWe pile into a place that looks like your typical breakfast diner,\nordering one and two dollar meals which Holmes pays for entirely in the\nquarters he has in his pockets. Holmes asks me what sort of political\nsoftware I want to work on and I tell him that as I\u2019ve radicalized I\u2019ve\nhad trouble thinking of software radical enough to keep up with my\npolitics. \u2018But projects don\u2019t have to be explicitly political to have\npolitical effects,\u2019 he says. \u2018Look at Wikipedia.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, look at Wikipedia,\u2019 I say. \u2018Wikipedia was founded by an\nObjectivist and its policies are explicitly anti-truth.\u2019 \u2018Anti-truth?\nWikipedia\u2019s policy is truth through process.\u2019 \u2018The Wikipedia [npov\npolicy\npage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#What_is_the_neutral_point_of_view.3F)\nexplicitly says that it doesn\u2019t matter whether something is true or not\n\u2014 it can only be put on a Wikipedia page if it\u2019s popular. And that makes\nsome sense from a certain perspective, but it\u2019s certainly not political.\nIn a messed-up society like ours, neutral policies don\u2019t have neutral\neffects. The process will just reinforce the status quo.\u2019\n\n\u2018Does this really happen?\u2019 \u2018Sure, I tried an experiment. I picked one\npage \u2014 the article on *From Time Immemorial*, a book that claimed there\nwere really no Palestinians \u2014 and tried to tell the full story, which\ninvolved such shocking facts as that a journal article exposing the book\nas a fraud couldn\u2019t get published anywhere. My well-cited additions kept\ngetting deleted and when I asked why someone explained on the talk page\nthat what I was saying was silly \u2014 nobody rejects journal articles that\nare accurate. Well this was precisely the point I was trying to argue\nagainst!\u2019\n\n\u2018So what\u2019s the solution? Does a wiki have to have an explicit political\npoint of view?\u2019 \u2018Well, that\u2019s one possibility \u2014 one that I\u2019m sort of\ntrying. But a simpler answer is to just say that instead of only\nincluding things people believe, only include things you can provide\ncitations for. Require people to provide evidence for their claims.\nThat\u2019s a much better way of getting truth and it\u2019s much more useful too,\nsince people can get the cites to learn more.\u2019\n\n* * * * *\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe second day of the Free Culture meeting is much shorter and emptier.\nUnder pressure, I give a short talk on my radical wikipedia and,\nshockingly, one of the people from Third World Majority comes up to me\nafterwards to note that she\u2019s actually used the site (which I haven\u2019t\neven told anyone about). And then I say my goodbyes (Tiffiniy says it\nfeels like the last day of summer camp) and drive to the airport with\nZack Rosen, get onto my plane, and fly back to California.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts\n\nAfter breakfast, the gang takes me on a small car tour around Worcester\nand then back to the train station. \u2018This didn\u2019t really work out the way\nI expected,\u2019 Tiffiniy says. \u2018We\u2019re not usually this social. I thought we\nwere just going to hold hands and walk around the city. You\u2019ll have to\ncome back. Think of Worcester as your home.\u2019 I thank them for their food\nand beds and tight-fitting pants and party invitations and so on and\nthen head into the grandly architected Worcester station and onto the\ntrain and back to Boston.", "external_links": ["http://www.downhillbattle.org/itunes/", "http://www.whatacrappypresent.com/", "http://www.downhillbattle.org/coal/", "http://www.greytuesday.org/", "http://www.blogtorrent.com/", "http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/14/bountyraising_for_en.html", "http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/22/get_paid_to_write_co.html", "http://theregular.org/", "http://opencongress.org/", "http://participatoryculture.org/", "http://participatoryculture.org/jobs/", "http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100956870", "http://www.activefreemedia.org/tour/", "http://sangament.com/djrekha/", "http://www.crummy.com/2005/04/21/1", "http://www.crummy.com/articles/jake_berendes_west_covina/", "http://crummy.com/music/", "http://www.xorph.com/jake_berendes_west_covina/", "http://www.corleonerecords.com/catmore.asp?release=42", "http://www.fujichia.com/stuffed/squids/", "http://www.fujichia.com/index1.html", "http://www.fujichia.com/stuffed", "http://cultureisaweapon.org/", "http://www.prometheusradio.org/", "http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20050523&s=karr", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/activefree/15723535/in/photostream/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#What_is_the_neutral_point_of_view.3F"], "time": 1120374000.0, "postid": "downhillbattle", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001645"]}, "savealife": {"post_title": "How to Save A Life", "tags": [], "post_content": "How to Save A Life\n==================\n\nAugust 18, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/savealife)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn 1972, the philosopher Peter Singer\n[proposed](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm) a simple\nthought experiment: Imagine you\u2019re on your way to work and you come\nacross a child drowning in a shallow pond. You\u2019re tall enough that you\ncan run in and rescue him, but if you do so you\u2019ll ruin your new suit.\nShould you save the child?\n\nAlmost everyone says yes: the value of saving a child\u2019s life far\noutweighs the cost of losing your new suit. Indeed, someone who would\nlet a child die to save their clothes seems like a monster.\n\nBut aha, Singer says. You \u2014 yes, *you*, the reader \u2014 probably spent\nseveral hundred dollars on new clothes recently, clothes you didn\u2019t\nreally need. (Or if not clothes, perhaps a dinner out, or music, or\nbooks you could\u2019ve gotten from the library.) And instead of spending\nthat money on luxuries, you could have [sent it to Partners in\nHealth](https://donate.pih.org/page/contribute/donate), and they could\nhave used it to save a child\u2019s life in the developing world.\n([GiveWell](http://www.givewell.net/recommended-charities) estimates\nthat you can save a life for between \\$150-\\$750.) How are you not a\nmonster?\n\nCalling your audience monsters is a dangerous move \u2014 it\u2019s apt to make\nthem very upset. (I know I got very upset the first time I read this\nargument!) Nobody wants to be thought of as a murderer, so people come\nup with all sorts of rationalizations for why they don\u2019t give (it\u2019s not\nmy responsibility, I do my fair share, foreign aid doesn\u2019t really do any\ngood, etc.). In his recent book, [*The Life You Can\nSave*](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/), Singer sets about\nsystematically debunking these arguments.\n\nIn the process, he complicates his original thought experiment. Imagine\nnow that instead of just you walking by the pond, five people are. And\nimagine that five children are also drowning. Still, he argues, most\npeople would say you should rush in to save a child \u2014 even if the other\npeople passing by don\u2019t.\n\nBut there\u2019s one detail Singer leaves out \u2014 one that I think dramatically\naffects his conclusions: the children didn\u2019t just wander into this pond\non their own; they were pushed.\n\nImagine an evil man stands above the pond, grabbing children and\nthrowing them in. People passing by see the children and rush in to try\nto save them, but as soon as one is saved or drowns, in goes another,\nand another, and another. You can rush in to try to save another child \u2014\nor you can try to stop the man.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t absolve you of moral duty. Most people do neither \u2014 they\njust walk on by the pond. But it does complicate the question. I think\nmost people would say you should try to stop the man, if you can. Even a\nutilitarian analysis would suggest this: diving in the pond saves one\nlife, stopping the man saves thousands.\n\nThe man, of course, is economics. People in the developing world are\npoor because they live in poor countries \u2014 countries without schools or\ngood jobs or welfare programs or even running water. And their countries\nare poor in large part because of us.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that visiting a developing country is like traveling\nback in time \u2014 the conditions seem little changed from those of medieval\nEurope. But how did medieval Europe stop being medieval Europe? The\nanswer is through protectionism: Britain became the reigning world power\nby being one of the most protectionist countries on earth, expending\nenormous amounts of government money to promote local industries.\nEventually these industries grew strong enough to compete on the world\nstage and it withdrew the barriers. The United States eventually\nsurpassed it with more of the same \u2014 many long years of tariffs and\nindustrial intervention (to this day the US government spends an\nenormous amount of money on R&D). Western Europe, the so-called \u201cAsian\ntigers\u201d \u2014 all the major developed countries of our era got there by\nfollowing these principles.\n\nBut they don\u2019t want others to follow in their footsteps. Instead of\nletting developing countries grow and compete in their own right, they\u2019d\nprefer to use them as a source of cheap labor and raw materials. So\nenormous effort has been expended on building international institutions\nto prevent their economic growth. The World Bank and the IMF issue loans\nto countries, but only on the condition they dismantle all forms of\nprotectionism. The WTO requires countries to agree to principles of\n\u201cfree trade\u201d. Academic \u201cexperts\u201d come up with reasons why protectionism\nreally hurts everyone and rewrite the history of economic growth.\n\nAs a result, poor countries are forced to stay poor and children keep\ndying in shallow ponds.\n\nStopping this is hard. I can give you a phone number to call to donate\nto Oxfam and buy a child life-saving treatment. There\u2019s no\ncomparably-effective way to help reform the WTO. Nobody knows how to\nstop the evil man. But it seems weird to pretend that he doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSinger considers this a purely practical question. As a utilitarian, he\ndoesn\u2019t support the notion that we have any special responsibility for\nthe actions of our government. Instead, he says, people should donate to\nhelp the poor in the most effective way they can see \u2014 whether that\u2019s\nsaving lives or structural reform is up to them. But Singer pretty\nclearly doesn\u2019t think structural reform is very effective; all of his\nexamples are about people directly saving lives.\n\nWould the passers-by really just keep jumping in the pond after the\nchildren he kept throwing? Or would they take a moment to stop and\nstrategize and think of how to stop the evil man. I think most would do\nthe latter. This isn\u2019t an abstract question. Children are dying right\nnow.

People\nlove starting companies. You get to be your own boss, work on something\nyou love, do something new and exciting, and get lots of attention. As\nDaniel Brook points out in *The Trap*, 28% of Americans have considered\nstarting their own business. And yet only 7% actually do.\n\nWhat holds them back? The lack of a social safety net. A friend of mine,\na brilliant young technologist who\u2019s been featured everywhere from PBS\nto Salon, stayed in academia and the corporate world while all of her\nfriends were starting companies and getting rich. Why? Because she\ncouldn\u2019t afford to lose her health insurance. Between skyrocketing\nprices and preexisting condition exclusions, it\u2019s almost impossible for\nanyone who isn\u2019t in perfect health to quit their job. (I only managed\nbecause I was on a government plan.)\n\nAnyone with children is also straight out. Startup founders tend to be\nquite young, in no small part because no one can afford to support a\nfamily on a startup founder\u2019s salary. But if we had universal child\ncare, that would be much less of an issue. Parents would be free to\npursue their dreams, knowing that their children were taken care of. And\nuniversal higher education could let parents spend their savings on\ngetting a business started, instead of their children\u2019s tuition. Plus,\nit\u2019d give many more kids the training and confidence they needed to\nstart a company.\n\nAnd those large private wealth funds that result from growing\ninequality? A real problem for startup founders is that they\u2019re *too\nlarge*. It used to be that you could borrow a couple thousand dollars\nfrom friends and neighbors to get your business off the ground.\nNowadays, they\u2019re too busy trying to make ends meet to be able to afford\nanything like that. Meanwhile, those large wealth funds I mentioned are\nnow so big they can only afford to invest in multi-million dollar chunks\n\u2014 much more than the average founder needs, or can even justify. And the\nlarge investments come with large amounts of scrutiny, further narrowing\nthe recipient pool.\n\nBut imagine if the government provided a basic minimum income, like\nRichard Nixon once proposed. Instead of having to save up (increasingly\ndifficult in a world in which the only way to survive is on credit card\ndebt) or borrow money to stay afloat, you could live off the\ngovernment-provided income as you got things started. Suddenly having to\nquit your job would no longer be such a huge leap \u2014 there\u2019d be a real\nsocial safety net to catch you. (Not to mention if those labor laws some\npeople want to loosen required your old job to take you back if things\ndidn\u2019t work out.)\n\nOf course, there is some truth to the standard proposals. Some startup\nfounders are encouraged by dreams of financial security, and high taxes\ncan make that dream more elusive. And complex labor regulations can make\nit difficult to get new companies off the ground. But it\u2019s not an issue\nof whether we should have taxes or labor laws \u2014 it\u2019s an issue of how\nthey\u2019re targeted.\n\nEstate taxes on inherited fortunes would have basically no impact on\nstartup founders, but could go a long way to funding a social safety\nnet. And since most startups are acquired as stock, income taxes are\nbasically irrelevant \u2014 it\u2019s really capital gains tax that gets applied.\nThere\u2019s no reason the government couldn\u2019t apply a lower capital gains\ntax to startups that get acquired than they do to the shares of\npublicly-traded companies that large investors trade.\n\nThe same is true for labor laws: preventing large companies from firing\npeople at random can provide some much-needed stability to their lives,\nespecially if they\u2019re saving up money in the hopes of going into\nbusiness themselves. But there\u2019s no reason such laws also have to be\napplied to small startups, where the company is more likely to go out of\nbusiness than to fire you.\n\nLook at social democratic Europe, where these policy prescriptions have\nbeen tried. While there\u2019s much less of a culture of entrepreneurship and\nonly 15% of Europeans think about starting their own company, nearly all\n(14.7%) of them actually go ahead and do it.\n\nThe fact is, if governments really want to promote startups and the\neconomic innovation they bring, they shouldn\u2019t listen to the standard\nrefrain of cut taxes and deregulate. They need to start rebuilding the\nsocial safety net, so that their citizens know that if they go out on a\nlimb and try something risky, someone will be there to catch them if\nthings don\u2019t work out.\n\n*Thanks to Daniel Brook\u2019s book* [The Trap: Selling Out to Stay Afloat in\nWinner-Take-All America](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088016) *for\nsuggesting this line of argument and providing the statistics.*\n", "external_links": ["http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html", "http://www.paulgraham.com/america.html", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088016"], "time": 1212994800.0, "postid": "prostartup", "internal_links": []}, "predatorstate": {"post_title": "The Predator State: A Summary", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Predator State: A Summary\n=============================\n\nAugust 19, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/predatorstate)\n\n* * * * *\n\nJames K.

There is no longer\nany vision on the right; the left should leave its defensive crouch and\nstart proposing something new.\n\n**2:** Friedman and friends said that markets would lead to democracy \u2014\nthat \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d begets political freedom. But economic freedom\nisn\u2019t what it sounds like; it\u2019s not freedom from economic want but\ninstead, as Friedman put it, \u201cthe freedom to choose\u201d or, in other words,\n\u201cthe freedom to shop\u201d. But control over production is as unfree as in\nthe Soviet Union, with advertising for propaganda, R&D for planning, and\nWall Street analysts for government inspectors. \u201cLines form, under\ncapitalism, every day.\u201d\n\n**3:** Supply-siders argued that a) saving is a public good because it\nleads to investment, b) America does not save enough compared to other\ncountries, c) saving would be unleashed by lowering taxes on it, d) the\nresulting investment would spur an economic boom. Every piece of this is\nwrong: a) in an efficient market, all the benefits from investment are\ncaptured by the investor; thus investment cannot be a public good unless\nmarkets are inefficient, in which case the government should step in\n*more*, b) the correct amount of saving is a policy decision, there\u2019s no\nreason to believe other countries have it right (the Soviet Union had a\n40% level of saving right up to its collapse), c) rich people save most\nof their money anyway (it\u2019s impossible to consume that much) and changes\nin interest rates dwarf changes in tax rates; furthermore, real\ninvestment is encouraged by *high* personal taxes, since this forces\npeople to keep their money in corporations, d) personal saving is less\nthan 1% of GDP; almost all investment comes from corporations or\noverseas.\n\n**4:** Milton Friedman claimed that high inflation (it was 10% in the\n1970s) was just the result of printing too much money. Reagan\u2019s Fed\nadopted this belief, sending the US and many foreign countries into deep\nrecession. Eventually, the policy was completely abandoned and high\ninflation has not been seen since. Serious inflation isn\u2019t caused by\nprinting money, but by wage-price spirals \u2014 the price of oil shot up,\ncausing rising prices to cover oil costs, causing workers to demand\nhigher wages to pay those prices, causing prices to rise even higher,\nand so on. Today, most prices are set by overseas manufacturers and\nlabor unions are so weak that workers can\u2019t demand wage increases.\nInflation is dead.\n\n**5:** Democrats (and some Republicans) repeatedly insist that we need\nto balance the budget or face fiscal collapse. But the budget is ruled\nby a simple equation: the total amount the government owes + the total\namount the public owes = the total amount we owe to foreign countries.\nThis is simple logic: whatever is not owed within the country must be\nowed to another country. But the international economy depends on other\ncountries keeping large reserves of dollars (see 14), meaning our trade\ndeficit must be high. As long as this is so, we must either have the\ngovernment run large deficits or ask people to do so. The budget deficit\nwas closed in the late 1990s because citizens picked up the slack with\nhigh credit card spending and home equity loans, inevitably leading to a\nslump. Balancing the budget is for suckers; Democrats should spend the\nmoney on public goods instead, promoting economic growth and thus\nraising tax revenue.\n\n**6:** The argument for free trade comes from Ricardo\u2019s \u201ccomparative\nadvantage\u201d \u2014 a clever textbook exercise, but irrelevant to the real\nworld since it assumes constant costs. In reality, either you produce\nmanufactured goods, in which your costs go down as you make more, or you\nsell off commodities, in which case your costs go up as you make more.\nWith the former, it takes time for local industry to build up the\nadvantage (requiring protectionism). With the latter, you end up like\nMongolia, which opened up its animal husbandry market, swelling herd\nsizes, turning grass into permanent desert, and killing off the entire\nmarket. With no other exports, such a country is in big trouble. Ricardo\nwas wrong: diversification, not specialization, is the way to develop \u2014\nand how every successful country has. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve forced this\nbroken system on most of the world. (China has escaped, letting\nstate-supported banks fund money-losing new companies until they grow\nlarge enough to succeed as exporters. In the mean time, they dump their\nproducts on local Chinese, allowing them to have a very high standard of\nliving at very low wages.)\n\n**7:** There is no trade-off between equality and efficiency. Instead,\nequality leads to efficiency. Denmark is one of the most equal countries\nin Europe, and as a result one of the wealthiest. The rest are on a\ncontinuum down to unequal and inefficient. Full employment and high\nwages require companies to make the most of the employees they have,\nincreasing efficiency. Raising the minimum wage doesn\u2019t raise\nunemployment, it lowers it \u2014 unemployment and inequality have risen and\nfallen together since 1920. Higher wages lead to more jobtaking and less\nquitting. The remaining increase in inequality was caused by stock\nmarket giveaways to dot-commers and Bush giveaways to government\ncontractors \u2014 which is why it was limited to Silicon Valley and the\nPotomac, respectively.\n\n**8:** The US is not a free market. Of GDP, 17% is health care (where\nexperts, not consumers decide how to spend), 16% is housing (subsidized\nby quasi-public mortgage firms and tax deductions), 15% is federal\nwelfare, 14% is local welfare, 4.5% is military spending, 3% is higher\neducation (paid for mostly by government or conspicuous\nphilanthropy^[1](#fn:1)^ and consumed for status and not value).\nTogether, 70% of US GDP is planned; it\u2019s just that our facade of a free\nmarket makes us less efficient at planning than other countries\n(especially in health care).\n\n**9:** In the 1970s, American industry (particularly steel and cars) was\nbeing challenged and weakened by Japan. Reagan\u2019s assault on inflation\n(see 4) dealt them a death blow, sending their foreign and domestic\nmarkets into deep recession, driving up the value of the dollar (making\ntheir exports more expensive than their competitors\u2019), and raising\ninterest rates. In the 1980s the technical staff left for Silicon\nValley, and 1990s financial fraud killed off what remained. When new\nstartup founders paid themselves exorbitant salaries from VC money other\nCEOs rushed to keep up, making them all wealthy enough to become a\nseparate class. They used their new power to prey on the corporations\nthat they ran.^[2](#fn:2)^\n\n**10:** Previously, regulation kept the predators in check \u2014 unions,\nNGOs, and progressive businesses pushed government standards to kill\nregressive competitors. But newly-wealthy predator CEOs had the\nRepublicans take over and gut regulation. The result is the Predator\nState, where every new law is a corporate giveaway. Prescription drug\nbenefits for Big Pharma; NCLB to defund and deskill schools (building\nsupport for vouchers); and Social Security reform to give workers\u2019\npaychecks to Wall Street. (Democrats have so far prevented the latter,\nbut corporate-funded think tanks now aim to take them down from inside.)\nThe programs allow further predation; privatizing college loans has led\nloan companies to bribe student loan officers. It\u2019s not that Republican\ngovernment fails at tasks like stopping Katrina; it\u2019s that such tasks of\ngovernance are not its goal \u2014 opening up New Orleans for Halliburton\ncontracts is.\n\n**11:** The great liberal economic agenda is \u201cmaking markets work\u201d \u2014\nsmall fixes for market failures. The canonical example is job training\nto fight unemployment. But job training does not create new jobs,\neconomic growth does; the tech boom was the last time we saw a real\ndecrease in unemployment. Similarly, some Dems propose universal\npreschool since experiments find kids with free preschool grow up to get\nbetter-paying jobs. But those preschools did not create jobs, they just\ngave their students an advantage in getting them. Universal preschool\nwould give everyone that advantage, leaving no net impact. And creating\nmarkets in unmarketable goods (health care, energy, the climate) is\ndoomed to failure. In these industries markets will not work; planning\nis required.\n\n**12:** Planning is alleged to have been disproven by the Soviet Union\u2019s\nfall. But it is unavoidable. The market, even when it does work, fails\nto take into account the wishes of the poor and the needs of the future,\nsince neither can buy things today. New Orleans fell not because of a\nlack of foresight (it was predicted by the local paper) or technology\n(the Army knew how to build strong levees) but because we lacked a\n*plan* \u2014 nobody in power bothered to do anything about it. Similarly,\nclimate change will melt Antarctica and drown New York, Boston, South\nFlorida, Houston, the Bay Area, London, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and\nShanghai. Stopping it requires a *plan*; an enormous one ranging from\nelementary school classes to government-funded research centers to a\nWWII-level restructuring of the economy.\n\n**13:** Deregulation can have three effects: 1) increasing competition\nand lowering wages and prices, 2) speeding technological change and\nincreasing quality, 3) creating monopolies and raising prices. Trucking\nderegulation did 1, airline deregulation did 1 and 2, but telecom,\nbanking, and energy deregulation did 3. Charles Keating donated to the\ngovernment, leading VP George H. W. Bush\u2019s task force to deregulate his\nindustry and allow the Savings and Loan Scandal. Ken Lay was Bush\u2019s\nlargest contributor, leading VP Dick Cheney\u2019s task force to deregulate\nhis industry and allow the Enron energy scandal.\n\nThe solution is to lower CEO pay, raise the minimum wage, and set wage\nstandards in between. Some liberals claim trade is the problem and the\nsolution is to set environmental and labor standards on other countries.\nThese are unenforceable and will be ineffective (companies moving\noverseas already build clean factories since that\u2019s most efficient and\nno significant exports are made using child or prison labor). Instead,\nwe should set wage standards at home, like Scandinavia, forcing\ncompanies to increase productivity and pay fair wages. Wage standards\nshould also apply to undocumented workers; illegal immigration is caused\nby employers who send recruiters to Mexico for compliant and low-paid\nworkers. Applying wage standards to all will end these abusive\npractices.\n\n**14:** Any country that can pay for its imports entirely with exports\ncan organize its internal economy (its people and resources) however it\nlikes. Countries that do not balance their trade depend instead on\nglobal capital markets and must play by their rules. But the US is a\nspecial case: after World War II (1944) it set up the Bretton Woods\nsystem of international exchange, pegging all currencies to the dollar\nand backing the dollar with gold reserves. But during Vietnam\u2019s deficits\n(1971), Nixon broke the system, devaluing US currency and wreaking havoc\non the rest of the world. Reagan\u2019s tight money policies (1981) caused so\nmuch instability that other countries were forced to build up reserves\nof US Treasury Bonds in exchange for military, economic, and export\nsecurity. US bubbles and the Soviet Union\u2019s fall make this system less\nsecure than before, but as long as it remains the US can do whatever it\nlikes economically. And it might as well, since economic success will\nstrengthen the system and the policies proposed here will lead to\neconomic success.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/141656683X)\n-   [Read chapter\n    1](http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?pid=623524&tab=10&agid=2)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

This time, however, it\u2019s being led by geeks themselves instead of\nbusiness guys. At the center of this democratizing force is the new\nfunding firm Y Combinator, led by Internet entrepreneur and essayist\nPaul Graham.\n\nY Combinator burst onto the scene by offering small grants to promising\ngraduates (average age: 23) to pursue their ambitions in startup form\nover the summer. And this past weekend, the people behind Y Combinator,\nin association with the Harvard Computer Society, took their show to the\nmasses, inviting 500 of the most promising startup founders to Harvard\nUniversity for an intense one-day lecture series on all aspects of\nstarting a company.\n\nThe weekend was kicked off with a smaller reception at Y Combinator\u2019s\noffices the night before. The room pulsed with networking between the\nvarious would-be founders, as well as some interesting meeting with some\nof the guests of honor.\n\n\u201cLast night was the first time I met my lawyer,\u201d said Steve Huffman,\nLord Ruler and Supreme Leader[\\*](#err1) of Reddit, one of the companies\nY Combinator has funded. \u201cThe first thing I said was \u2018Am I getting\ncharged for this?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 she told me. \u2018There are rules preventing us\nfrom charging for parties.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, clusters of people formed around the night\u2019s VIPs, including\nblogger Joel Spolsky, scientist Stephen Wolfram, and, of course, the\nReddit developers themselves, who found themselves deluged by excited\nfans.\n\nThe startup school itself was a similarly star-studded event, with Apple\nComputer co-founder Steve Wozniak telling the story of how his company\ngot started. Michael Mandel, chief economist for *BusinessWeek* touted\nthe virtues of America\u2019s entrepreneurial culture to the assembled crowd.\n\u201cPeople starting companies and risking failure are what makes America so\ngreat. The people in this room are doing God\u2019s work,\u201d he said to\napplause.\n\nSenior officials from Google and Yahoo both espoused the virtues of\ntheir respective companies. Lawyers from top-tier law firms provided\nadvice on protecting a company\u2019s intellectual property and navigating\nsome of the complex legal waters of the modern business world. Founders\nLangley Steinert, Marc Hedlund, and Olin Shivers tried to share some of\ntheir assembled experience.\n\nBecause space was limited, people who wanted to attend simply needed to\nfill out a simple questionnaire about their background, but the event\nwas entirely free of charge. It might seem unusual for a company\ninterested in helping hackers start companies to try to give some of\nthat value away but Paul Graham had an explanation. \u201cThere\u2019s a concept\nin venture capital known as \u2018deal flow\u2019,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe\ndeal flow is all the interesting startups to fund flowing by. And\nventure capitalists just try to grab the best ones for themselves. Well,\nwe think the real solution to this is to increase the total deal flow\nfor everyone.\u201d\n\nPaul Graham himself gave a very well-received talk on how to come up\nwith ideas for startups. The thing that trips people up, he suggested,\nwas mistakenly thinking that a good startup idea needed to be a\nmillion-dollar idea. Instead, he proposed prospective founders simply\nlook around for things that are broken with the world and try to fix\nthem.\n\nVideo of the talks will be available on the startup school website\nshortly.\n\n*Jessica Livingston contributed to this report.

The traditional criterion is that your importance is\nmeasured by the effect of what you do. Thus the most important lawyers\nare the Supreme Court justices, since their decisions affect the entire\nnation. And the greatest mathematicians are those that make important\ndiscoveries, since their discoveries end up being used by many who\nfollow.\n\nThis seems quite reasonable. One\u2019s legacy depends on one\u2019s impact and\nwhat better way to measure impact than by the effect of what you\u2019ve\ndone. But this is measuring against the wrong baseline. The real\nquestion is not what effect your work had, but what things would be like\nhad you never done it.\n\nThe two are not at all the same. It is rather commonly accepted that\nthere are \u201cideas whose time has come\u201d and history tends to bear this\nout. When Newton invented the calculus, so did Leibniz. When Darwin\ndiscovered evolution through natural selection, so did Alfred Russel\nWallace. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, so did\nElisha Gray (before him, arguably).\n\nIn these cases the facts are plain: had Newton, Darwin, and Bell never\ndone their work, the result would have been largely the same \u2014 we\u2019d\nstill have calculus, evolution, and the telephone. And yet such people\nare hailed as major heroes, their legacies immortalized.\n\nPerhaps, if one only cares about such things, this is enough. (Although\nthis seems a rather dangerous game, since the future could wake up at\nany moment and realize its adulation is misplaced.) But if one genuinely\ncares about their impact, instead of simply how their impact is\nperceived, more careful thought is in order.\n\nI once spent time with a well-known academic, who had published several\nworks widely recognized as classics even outside his field, and he\noffered some career advice in the sciences. (Actually, come to think of\nit, there are two people of whom this is true, suggesting the phenomenon\nhas broader significance.) Such-and-such a field is very hot right now,\nhe said, you could really make a name for yourself by getting into it.\nThe idea being that major discoveries were sure to follow soon and that\nif I picked that field I could be the one to make them.\n\nBy my test, such a thing would leave a poor legacy. (For what it\u2019s\nworth, I don\u2019t think either person\u2019s works fall into this category; that\nis to say, their reputation is still deserved even by these standards.)\nEven worse, you\u2019d know it. Presumably Darwin and Newton didn\u2019t begin\ntheir investigations because they thought the field was \u201chot\u201d. They\nthought through doing it they would have a significant impact, even\nthough that turned out to be wrong. But someone who joined a field\nsimply because they thought a major discovery would come from it soon\ncould never enjoy such a delusion. Instead, they would know that their\nwork would make little difference, and would have to labor under such\nimpressions.\n\nThe same is true of other professions we misconceive of as being\nimportant. Take being a Supreme Court justice, for example.\nTraditionally, this is thought of as a majestic job in which one gets to\nmake decisions of great import. In fact, it seems to me that one has\nlittle impact at all. Most of your impact was made by the politics of\nthe President who appointed you. Had you not been around for the job, he\nwould have found someone else who would take similar positions. The only\nway one could have a real impact as Supreme Court justice would be to\nchange your politics once appointed to the bench and the only way you\ncould prepare for such a thing would be to spend the majority of your\ncareer doing things you thought were wrong in the hopes that one day you\nmight get picked for the Supreme Court. That seems a rather hard lot to\nswallow.\n\nSo what jobs do leave a real legacy? It\u2019s hard to think of most of them,\nsince by their very nature they require doing things that other people\n*aren\u2019t* trying to do, and thus include the things that people haven\u2019t\nthought of. But one good source of them is trying to do things that\nchange the system instead of following it. For example, the university\nsystem encourages people to become professors who do research in certain\nareas (and thus many people do this); it discourages people from trying\nto change the nature of the university itself.\n\nNaturally, doing things like changing the university are much harder\nthan simply becoming yet another professor. But for those who genuinely\ncare about their legacies, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much choice.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1149145200.0, "postid": "legacy", "internal_links": []}, "writefp": {"post_title": "False Outliers", "tags": ["projects", "personal"], "post_content": "False Outliers\n==============\n\nSeptember 5, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/writefp)\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo far [my Wikipedia\nscript](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia) has churned\nthrough about 200 articles, calculating who wrote what in each. This\nmorning I looked through them to see if there were any that didn\u2019t match\nmy theory. It printed out a couple and I decided to investigate.\n\nThe first it found was [Alkane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkane), a\nlong technical article about acyclic saturated hydrocarbons that it said\nwas largely written by\n[Physchim62](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Physchim62). Yesterday a\ngood friend was telling me that he thought long technical articles were\nlikely written by a single person, so I immediately thought that here\nwas the proof that he was right. But, just to check, I decided to look\nin the edit history to make sure my script hadn\u2019t made an error.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t, I found, but once again simply looking at the numbers missed\nthe larger point. Physchim62 had indeed contributed most of the article,\nbut according to the edit comments, it was by translating the German\nversion! I don\u2019t have the German data, but presumably it was written in\nthe same incremental way as most of the articles in my study.\n\nThe next serious case was [Characters in Atlas\nShrugged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged),\nwhich the script said was written by CatherineMunro. Again, it seemed\nplausible that one person could have written all those character bios.\nBut again, an investigation into the actual edit history found that\nMunro hadn\u2019t written them, instead she\u2019d copied them from a bunch of\nsubpages, merging them into one bigger page.\n\nThe final serious example was [Anchorage,\nAlaska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage%2C_Alaska), which\nappeared to have been written by\n[JeffreyAllen1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JeffreyAllen1975).\nHere the contributions seemed quite genuine; JeffreyAllen1975 made tons\nof edits each contributing a paragraph at a time. The work seemed to\ntake quite a toll on him; at his user page he noted \u201cI just got\nburned-out and tired of the online encyclopedia. My time is being taken\naway from me by being with Wikipedia.\u201d He lasted about four months.\n\nStill, something seemed fishy about JeffreyAllen1975, so I decided to\ninvestigate further. Currently, the Anchorage page has a tag noting that\n\u201cThe current version of the article or section reads like an\nadvertisement.\u201d A bit of Googling revealed why: JeffreyAllen1975\u2019s\ncontributions had been copied-and-pasted from other websites, like [the\nAnchorage Chamber of\nCommerce](http://www.anchoragechamber.org/info/relocation.htm)\n(\u201cAnchorage\u2019s public school system is ranked among the best in the\nnation. \u2026 The district\u2019s average SAT and ACT College entrance exam\nscores are consistently above the national average and Advanced\nPlacement courses are offered at each of the district\u2019s larger high\nschools.\u201d).\n\nI suspect JeffreyAllen1975 didn\u2019t know what he was doing; his writing\nstyle suggests he\u2019s just a kid: \u201cIn my free time, I am very proud of\nmy-self by how much I\u2019ve learned by making good edits on Wikipedia\narticles.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure he just thought he was helping the project:\n\u201cWikipedia is like the real encyclopedia books (A thru Z) that you see\nin the library, but better.\u201d But his plagiarism will still have to be\nremoved.\n\nWhen I started, just looking at the numbers these seemed to be several\ncases that strongly contradicted my theory. And had I just stuck to\nlooking at the numbers, I would have believed that to be the case as\nwell. But, once again, investigation shows the picture to be far more\ninteresting: translation, reorganization, and plagiarism.

We\u2019re somewhere over a dark patch in the middle of the\ncountry and I\u2019m in the window seat in the last row in the plane.

But that\u2019s not the problem.\n\nNo, the problem is that I am terribly, almost unbearably, thirsty. My\nmouth has been dry for hours, we\u2019re long past that. Now I\u2019m so thirsty\nthat the color has drained from my face, because there simply is no\nfluid left to keep it there. I am so thirsty that it\u2019s beginning to feel\nlike there\u2019s no water around to hydrate my brain so my neocortex is\ngetting and shrivelling up. It\u2019s an odd feeling, your brain shriveling\nup. It makes it hard to think. But I guess that\u2019s not really the problem\neither.\n\nThe problem, the real problem I suppose, is that I can\u2019t ask for\nanything to drink. I am perfectly justified \u2014 I was asleep during the\ndrink service, I am quite terribly thirsty, my flight is unusually\nuncomfortable to begin with \u2014 yet I cannot bring myself to do it. As the\nflight attendants walk briskly by, I fail to catch their eyes. And the a\nman sitting in the seat next to me on the aisle has headphones on, so I\ncan\u2019t exactly interrupt him. I could ring my flight attendant call\nbutton, but I\u2019ve never quite been able to bring myself to do that. I\u2019m\nso close to the flight attendants anyway.\n\nIf I rang the call button, I tell myself, I wouldn\u2019t ask for a Sprite.\nI\u2019d just ask for water. Asking for a Sprite, it\u2019d seem like I was\ninterrupting them just so I could get my soda fix. Like I was some sort\nof petulant child who had to have his soda and was going to throw a\ntemper tantrum if they didn\u2019t get it. Like a troublemaker, the kind of\nperson they look down on. But water? Water they\u2019d understand: it was a\ngenuine medical request, a normal, physical human need. Something\ntotally worth taking the extraordinary step of pressing the flight\nattendant call button.\n\nBut I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. It seems like such an imposition.\n\nThis, I suppose, is the actual problem: I feel my existence is an\nimposition on the planet. Not a huge one, perhaps, not a huge one at\nall, but an imposition nonetheless. When I go to a library and I see the\nlibrarian at her desk reading, I\u2019m afraid to interrupt her, even though\nshe sits there specifically so that she may be interrupted, even though\nbeing interrupted by for reasons like this by people like me is her very\njob. At the fast food restaurant, I feel embarrassed taking time to pick\nthrough my pocket for appropriate change, so I always give them whole\nbills, then feel embarrassed when they have to take the time to count\n*me* out change. When someone asks me what high school I\u2019m going to, I\nfeel awkward explaining to them that I\u2019ve gone to high school and to\ncollege and then started a company and sold it, so I just stutter a bit\nand then tell them that my high school is outside of Chicago.\n\nI realize this is neurotic. Maybe not the high school thing, maybe\nthat\u2019s just politeness, but certainly the thing right now, the brain\nshriveling with the knees digging and yet still the fear of asking for\nsome water. \u201cThis is neurotic, Aaron,\u201d I say to myself. \u201cYou are being\nneurotic. It is not normal to be this shy. And geez, certainly you of\nall people have little justification for being so undemanding.\u201d\n\nI am a good person, I mean. I work hard, I happily pay my taxes, I think\nof ways to make the world a better place, I always look the woman behind\nthe counter in the eye and say \u201cthank you, thank you,\u201d as if I really\nmean it, as if I really do appreciate the effort it took for her punch\nmy order into her cash register and withdraw the right amount of change.\nAnd I do! So I deserve this, I deserve my glass of water, my can of\nsoda. I am not like one of those people who goes around robbing banks\nand mugging old ladies and then stands in front of me in the supermarket\nline, throwing a tantrum about how dare the clerk not accept my credit\ncard. No, *I* am perfectly justified in asking for a glass of water. I\nknow all this, and yet, somehow, I still feel like an imposition.\n\nNormally, it\u2019s not so bad feeling this way. Normally, I just sit in my\nquiet little room and do the small things that bring me pleasures. I\nread my books, I answer email, I write a little bit. I\u2019m not such a\nnuisance to the world, and the kick I get out of living can, I suppose,\njustify the impositions I make on it. But when life isn\u2019t so fun, well,\nthen I start to wonder. What\u2019s the point of going on if it\u2019s just\ntrouble for us both?\n\nMy friends will miss me, I am told. And I guess it\u2019s somewhat better\naround friends. For some reason asking them for things doesn\u2019t seem\nquite so bad. Perhaps we\u2019ve established some rapport, perhaps I feel\nI\u2019ve given *them* enough to justify my small requests, perhaps I feel\nlike my friends are special people who think along the same lines I do\nand thus understand my needs. (Inner critic: \u201cYeah, only a fellow genius\nwould understand your special need for *water*. Jesus, what a dweeb.\u201d)\nBut even so, I feel reticent. Even among my closest friends, I still\nfeel like something of an imposition, and the slightest shock, the\nslightest hint that I\u2019m correct, sends me scurrying back into my hole.\n\nI know, I know, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong to feel this way. My friends love\nme. They remark, spontaneously, about how nice it is to have me around.\nThey invite me over to their houses to hang out. Indeed, at this very\nmoment, two of my very favorite people to hang out with are actually\nfighting \u2014 fighting! \u2014 over the supposed privilege of having me live\nwith them. \u201cI just want to point out,\u201d one says, \u201cthat I have never\ntickled you.\u201d \u201cI just want to point out,\u201d replies the other, \u201cthat I\nhave never gotten you to attach clothespins to your face.\u201d\n\nClearly, rationally, I am in the wrong. These people like me. (Inner\ncynic: \u201cIf only to have someone around to tickle and pinch.\u201d) No, no,\nthey genuinely like me. But the idea that people might actually *want*\nto be around me takes an amazing amount of getting used to. Last night,\nfor the first time, I invited some people over to my apartment. I\u2019ve\nnever done this before. But, to my amazement, they all came. They even\nbrought their friends. I ran out of chairs. The idea that a group of\npeople would want to come over to see me was kind of stunning. Someone\neven brought wine.\n\nOK, so perhaps there is a small group of people who, whether through\nquirks of genetics or some childhood trauma, appear, as best as I can\ntell, to actively enjoy my company. (Inner elitist: \u201cOr just need\nexcuses to drink wine?\u201d) But this does not excuse my impositions on the\nstore clerk, the librarian, the man inquiring after my high school who I\ndownright lied to \u2014 *lied* to! \u2014 just to avoid pointing out the error of\nhis preconceptions, the bus driver who I had to distract with my\ninability to use the new stored-value payment machines, or the waiter at\nthat restaurant I went to the other day who, I later realized to my\nendless mortification, I forgot to properly tip. (Waiter, if you\u2019re out\nthere, please send me your address so I can mail you your tip! I\u2019m so\nsorry!) These people did not request the dubious pleasure of my company.\nI have no justification for bothering them with my requests.\n\nOh, but you know, I really want some water\u2026\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1170835200.0, "postid": "imposition", "internal_links": []}, "sweatsmall": {"post_title": "Sweating the Small Stuff", "tags": [], "post_content": "Sweating the Small Stuff\n========================\n\nSeptember 16, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/sweatsmall)\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo [Jottit](http://jottit.com/) has launched, only five months after I\nsuggested to my friend Simon that we create a website that was just a\nbig text box people could type stuff into. And there are two ways I look\nat it. One is: It took us five months to do *that*? And the other is: We\ndid that in only five months?\n\nWhen you look at what the site does, it seems pretty simple. It has few\nfeatures, no complex algorithms, little gee-whiz gadgetry. It just takes\nyour text and puts it on the Web. And considering how often I do that\nevery day, it seems a bit odd that it took so long to create yet another\nway. And then I check the todo list.\n\n[As I\u2019ve said](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/perfectionism), this is a\nsite I wanted to get every little detail right on. And when you start\nsweating the small stuff, it\u2019s frankly incredible just how much of it\nthere is. Even our trivial site is made up of over two dozen different\nscreens. Each one of those screens has to be designed to look and work\njust right on a wide variety of browsers, with a wide variety of text in\nthem.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just making things look good \u2014 making them work right is much\nharder. Each screen does, on average, five or six different things. And\neach of those things can be done under three or four different modes.\nNow we\u2019re up to over 500 different things to do, each of which can have\nbugs in lots of unthought-of ways. And then, many of these pieces are\nexposed to users, who can do whatever they want with them \u2014 and do. If\nyou\u2019re building a site that accepts text from users, you need to think\nabout something that lets some people just paste stuff from emails,\nothers write HTML, others play YouTube videos, while others try to\ninsert malicious text to break things for people.\n\nThere are lots of features we want to add to Jottit, but before we do\nany of that we want to make what we have work perfectly. And, at the\nmoment, that means tasks as varied as reporting a bug in a piece of\nsoftware we use to its developer, configuring the web server to display\na nicer error message under certain odd conditions, having another\ncomputer monitor the first computer to see if it goes down, figuring out\nhow to tweak the UI to make certain unclear things clearer to people,\nrewriting some of the text on the site to be nicer, creating a new site\nto inform our users of updates, making some stuff from our project open\nsource, fixing stuff in other open source projects, testing the site on\nphones and weird browsers, examining an algorithm we use to see if it\nneeds improvement, and fixing a bug that was just reported by a user.\nAnd those are just the things on *my* todo list!\n\nWhen you look at it that way, it\u2019s amazing anyone ever builds a website.\n", "external_links": ["http://jottit.com/"], "time": 1189926000.0, "postid": "sweatsmall", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/perfectionism"]}, "basicnutrition": {"post_title": "Nutrition Basics", "tags": [], "post_content": "Nutrition Basics\n================\n\nJuly 28, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/basicnutrition)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs part of changing my eating habits, I\u2019ve become quite interested on\nthe subject of nutrition. I can\u2019t seem to find a good guide to the\nsubject online, so in the spirit of flailing in public until someone\ncomes to my aid, I thought I\u2019d write up what I think I know. Feel free\nto correct me or point me to better sources in the comments.\n\n**Calories** are the basis of eating; they\u2019re a measure of the amount of\nenergy a food provides. Your body gets calories from the food you eat\nand spends them to keep you moving. If you get more calories than you\nspend, your body stores the excess as fat. If you spend more than you\nget, your body burns some of the fat it\u2019s stored up (for just such an\noccasion).\n\nThus the standard advice for losing weight: eat less, exercise more.\nEating less brings fewer calories in, while exercising more uses up more\nof them. Unfortunately, both of these things are quite hard to achieve,\nbecause the body seems to regulate them through [the use of \u201cset\npoints\u201d](http://www.slate.com/id/2663/): your body keeps track of how\nmuch fat you have through a chemical called leptin and makes you hungry\nif you\u2019re starting to lose weight. Thus, if you skip a meal in the\nmorning, it\u2019ll be sure to make you extra hungry in the evening, so that\nyour overall weight doesn\u2019t change.\n\nA similar setpoint seems to operate for exercise. In one experiment,\ndoctors measured how much children moved around with pedometers. Then\nthey tried forcing the children to exercise by giving them a PE class.\nThey found that when kids were forced to exercise at school, they\nexercised less at home, and ended up doing the same amount of exercise\noverall. So just as your body seems to make you hungry when you\u2019re\nlosing weight and full when you\u2019re gaining it, it seems to make you\ntired when you\u2019ve burned too many calories and antsy when you haven\u2019t\nburned enough.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re not total slaves to such motivations \u2014 we can force\nourselves when to eat when full or not to eat when hungry, to exercise\nwhen tired or to stay still when antsy \u2014 but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind\nwhat we\u2019re up against.\n\n**Fats** have gotten a bad rap, most likely because they share a name\nwith body fat but also, [some\nargue](http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/lowfatcapitalism.html),\nbecause they seem lower-class. In truth, however, they\u2019re largely just\none way to get calories, and a calorie is a calorie no matter where it\ncomes from.\n\nFats also have effects on **cholesterol**, a key building block for your\nbody\u2019s cells. There are two types of cholesterol \u2014 known informally as\ngood and bad cholesterol. Good cholesterol consists of tightly-packed\nproteins of cholesterol in your blood stream, allowing cholesterol to be\nefficiently transported where it needs to go. Bad cholesterol is less\ndensely packed and its cholesterol ends up sticking in the walls of\narteries, clogging them and leading to heart disease. Fats have varying\neffects on cholesterol. Saturated fats should be avoided: they increase\nlevels of bad cholesterol (although they also increase good\ncholesterol). Unsaturated fats, however, whether monounsaturated or\npolyunsaturated, are good: they lower bad cholesterol and raising good\ncholesterol. *Trans* fats are just the reverse: they increase bad\ncholesterol levels *and* decrease good ones; it\u2019s recommended they be\navoided as much as possible.\n\nOften nutrition labels only break out unsaturated fats and trans fats;\nyou have to calculate the amount of saturated fat by subtracting these\nfrom the amount of total fat. The goal, remember, is to avoid trans fats\nwhenever possible, avoid saturated fats, and go for unsaturated fats.\n\n**Carbohydrates** are another source of calories, the kind found in\nwhite wheat products, like bread and pasta. **Sugars** are a form of\ncarbohydrate and, in fact, the body breaks down other carbohydrates into\nsimple sugars. The problem with sugars is that they go directly into the\nbloodstream, spiking your blood sugar level. This in itself is\nunhealthy, but it\u2019s even worse when the level inevitably crashes and you\nbegin to feel hungry again and eat even more.\n\nThe exception is with fiber, which the body can\u2019t break down. Foods made\nfrom whole wheat are high in fiber, so your body takes longer to digest\nthem and the sugar intake is spread out over a longer period of time.\nThus while carbohydrates might generally be avoided, whole wheat\nproducts (along with fruits and vegetables), include additional\nnutrients as well as having a safe impact on blood sugar, and are the\nfoundation of a healthy diet.\n\n**Protein** is a similar essential nutrient, allowing the body to make\nessential components of muscle and hair and so on. If you don\u2019t get\nenough (about 9 grams of protein for every 20 pounds), the body begins\nbreaking down its tissues. (Eating far too much protein, however, as\npeople in low-carb diets do, can be unhealthy as it absorbs calcium from\nyour bones.) While protein can be found in animal products, whole wheat\nbread is a also an excellent source \u2014 a single slice contains five grams\nof protein. Unfortunately, the proteins found in grains and vegetables\nare incomplete, so you either need to get some (complete) animal protein\nor eat a variety of them.\n\n**Calcium** is necessary for building bones and teeth, maintaining the\nheart\u2019s rhythmym, and more. Deficiency can lead to weakened bones and\nfractures. While dairy products contain significant amounts of calcium,\nthey also contain a lot of saturated fat and has been linked to some\ncancers. Many other foods are fortified with calcium and some vegetables\n(kale and collard greens, dried beans, and legumes) are also a good\nsource.\n\n**Vitamins** do all sorts of good things, as well as warding off\ndiseases like scurvy and rickets. They\u2019re often added to juices and\ncereals and can be taken by themselves in a daily multivitamin as well.\n\nFor additional information, check out:\n\n-   [Nutrition Source](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/),\n    Harvard School of Public Health\n\n", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/id/2663/", "http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/lowfatcapitalism.html", "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/"], "time": 1154070000.0, "postid": "basicnutrition", "internal_links": []}, "founderssyndrome": {"post_title": "Founder\u2019s Syndrome", "tags": [], "post_content": "Founder\u2019s Syndrome\n==================\n\nOctober 27, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/founderssyndrome)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe simplest way to do something, of course, is to do it yourself. But\nthere\u2019s lots of stuff to be done and not enough you to do it. You can\nget around this a little bit by finding friends who are interested in\ndoing some of it themselves, but at some point you\u2019re going to have to\nstart \u201cdelegating\u201d, or getting somebody else to do it.\n\nNow you\u2019re moving up in the world. If you\u2019re a decent manager, instead\nof running one project, you can run five or ten. Instead of simply\ndirecting your own labor, you can direct whole groups of people. Of\ncourse, it\u2019ll still be people doing what you wanted, but \u2014 funny thing \u2014\npeople are smart enough that they\u2019ll begin to get the gist of things on\ntheir own and, if you do it right, your delegation will become an\norganization. You can disappear for a week and things will keep on\nmarching.\n\nBut make no mistake, even those organizations are still following the\nwill of their erstwhile founder. Even as they get big, they betray\nfacets of the founder\u2019s personality. The most obvious is in who is\nrespected. My friend Emmett Shear has a theory that in each company only\none class of people can be in charge and it\u2019s going to be the class of\npeople the founders are in. At Apple, for example, the UI designers are\nin charge, because Jobs obsesses over UI design. At Google, it\u2019s the\nprogrammers, because Larry and Sergey used to code. Even though the\nfounders aren\u2019t directly involved in every project, their surrogates\nstill win the day.\n\nNow the problem comes when the organization wants to grow beyond its\nfounder. This is most common on non-profits, where they even have a name\nfor it: founder\u2019s syndrome. See, once you have all these people carrying\nout your bidding, it\u2019s pretty difficult to want to give that up. Maybe\nyou can have them do more projects, maybe you can give them more\nflexibility in what they choose, but I can\u2019t think of a single story\nwhere the guy in charge voluntarily gave up his power. And that has a\nsevere cost (which I\u2019ve come to calling the \u201cpower premium\u201d) because\ngiving up your power is often the right thing to do.\n\nIn non-profits, for example, your organization is probably made up of a\nbunch of independent-minded young people with a strong belief in\ndemocracy. These people aren\u2019t too happy being told what to do all the\ntime, especially when the instructions are pretty obviously not the best\nthing for the non-profit\u2019s mission. So they rebel against the founder,\nand the founder tries to hold on to power, and things get very messy. (I\ndon\u2019t know how things usually turn out in this situation. Maybe you\nfight until the founder dies?)\n\nLess well noticed is that the same mistake is made by for-profit\ncorporations as well, it\u2019s just less obvious because the founder is the\nfellow holding all the cash, so you fight about it at your peril. But\ncompanies regularly do stupid things, even when if you asked all the\npeople in the company about it they would have told you they were\nstupid. But in a capitalist economy, the founder has to maintain\ncontrol.\n\nBut the power premium has a even more serious cost. While many people\nseem to be able to make the leap from doing something themselves to\nbuilding an organization to do it, nobody seems to have been very good\nat taking the next step: going from an organization to a\nmeta-organization, an organization that hires other organizations to do\nits work, rather than hiring people directly.\n\nWhy? Partly because few people get to be in charge of something the size\nof Google, where they need to take that next step to grow, and perhaps\nthe trait of thinking that big is rare. But I think part of it is simply\nbecause the people at the top can\u2019t give up their power. Engaging\norganizations means you\u2019re no longer in charge of what people do or how\nthey do it; the organizations have to be in charge of that. And that\nmeans you\u2019re no longer a delegator, but more of a moderator. It\u2019s\nfounder\u2019s syndrome at the largest scale.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1161932400.0, "postid": "founderssyndrome", "internal_links": []}, "2taste": {"post_title": "Two Conceptions of Taste", "tags": [], "post_content": "Two Conceptions of Taste\n========================\n\nDecember 1, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2taste)\n\n* * * * *\n\nTaste is difficult to define and even harder to justify, so let us just\ntake it for granted for a moment. (Alright, for those who don\u2019t get the\npicture, here\u2019s a quick attempt: taste is the ability to create\nelegance. The people who made the iPod clearly have taste; the people\nwho made Windows do not.) Unfortunately for me, it seems like a lot of\npeople in the US don\u2019t have much taste. (Try watching the infographics\non the network evening news, for example.) But even among people who\nhave taste, I\u2019ve noticed there are two kinds: positive and negative.\n\nNegative taste is the ability to tell when something is bad. Positive\ntaste is the ability to make something that is good. Indeed, one might\neven say that there is only one kind of taste and positive taste is\nsimply negative taste plus skills. But since taste is generally inferred\nfrom creations, it\u2019s probably simpler to treat them as two different\nthings.\n\nPeople with negative taste can make things that look really nice, but\nthey also look very plain. I think the founders of Google have negative\ntaste. John Gruber, as far as I can tell, mostly does. Same with Paul\nGraham. (As do I, for that matter.) People with negative taste make\nthings by trying something very simple and then stripping away pieces\nuntil it looks good. They can detect goodness, but not create it, so\nthey\u2019re limited to designs with very few variables, because then they\ncan go thru all the options and pick out the ones that look OK.\n\nPeople with positive taste, on the other hand, can make things that\ngenuinely look good. This gives them a lot more freedom in their designs\n(they can use colors other than white!). Truly good designers have\npositive taste. Unfortunately for people like us, Apple seems to have\nhired most of them and put them to work building fairly bland web sites.\n\nOf course, taste applies to far more fields than design. One could apply\nthe same idea to writing. Positive taste writers can write beautiful\nflowing prose that looks you in. Negative taste writers can only write\nbeautiful things by staying simple.\n\nPeople with negative taste can recognize people with positive taste and\nhire them. People with no taste, on the other hand, fail to see the\ndifference, resulting in disasters like the graphic design department of\nAmerican Airlines.\n\nPeople with negative taste can also be critics, which brings us to Joe\nClark\u2019s [famous\ncomment](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2004JulSep/0237.html)\n\u201cActually, no, it is not the responsibility of the critic to solve the\nproblem. Pauline Kael was not expected to rewrite and redirect the films\nshe disliked.\u201d\n\nPeople with negative taste can pick out the bad movies. They just can\u2019t\nmake great ones.\n\n*Followups:* John Siracusa,\n[Hypercritical](http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars)\n(2009)\n", "external_links": ["http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2004JulSep/0237.html", "http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars"], "time": 1164960000.0, "postid": "2taste", "internal_links": []}, "theinfo": {"post_title": "Introducing theinfo.org", "tags": [], "post_content": "Introducing theinfo.org\n=======================\n\nJanuary 15, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theinfo)\n\n* * * * *\n\nA lot of the work I\u2019ve been doing on Open Library for the past few\nmonths has to do with handling large quantities of data.

Let us eschew humility for the sake of argument and suppose that\nI am a great programmer. By Hardy\u2019s suggestion, the responsible thing\nfor me to do would be to cultivate and use my talents in that field, to\nspend my life being a great programmer. And that, I have to say, is a\nprospect I look upon with no small amount of dread.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was not always quite this way. For quite a while programming was\nbasically my life. And then, somehow, I drifted away. At first it was\nsmall steps \u2014 discussing programming instead of doing it, then\ndiscussing things *for* programmers, and then discussing other topics\naltogether. By the time I reached the end of my first year in college,\nwhen people were asking me to program for them over the summer, I hadn\u2019t\nprogrammed in so long that I wasn\u2019t even sure I really could. I\ncertainly did not think of myself as a particularly good programmer.\n\nIronic, considering Hardy writes that\n\n> Good work is not done by \u2018humble\u2019 men. It is one of the first duties\n> of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little\n> both the importance of his subject and his own importance in it. A man\n> who is always asking \u2018Is what I do worthwhile?\u2019 and \u2018Am I the right\n> person to do it?\u2019 will always be ineffective himself and a\n> discouragement to others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a\n> little more of his subject and himself than they deserve. This is not\n> too difficult: it is harder not to make his subject and himself\n> ridiculous by shutting his eyes too tightly.\n\nPerhaps, after spending so much time not programming, the blinders had\nworn off. Or perhaps it was the reverse: that I had to convince myself\nthat I was good at what I was doing now, and, since that thing was not\nprogramming, by extension, that I was not very good at programming.\n\nWhatever the reason, I looked upon the task of actually having to\nprogram for three months with uncertainty and trepidation. For days, if\nI recall correctly, I dithered. Thinking myself incapable of serious\nprogramming, I thought to wait until my partner arrived and instead\nspend my time assisting him. But days passed and I realized it would be\nweeks before he would appear, and I finally decided to try to program\nsomething in the meantime.\n\nTo my shock, it went amazingly well and I have since become convinced\nthat I\u2019m a pretty good programmer, if lacking in most other areas. But\nnow I find myself faced with this dilemma: it is those other areas I\nwould much prefer to work in.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe summer before college [I learned\nsomething](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany) that struck me as\nincredibly important and yet known by very few. It seemed clear to me\nthat the only responsible way to live my life would be to do something\nthat would only be done by someone who knew this thing \u2014 after all,\nthere were few who did and many who didn\u2019t, so it seemed logical to\nleave most other tasks to the majority.\n\nI concluded that the best thing to do would be to attempt to explain\nthis thing I\u2019d learned to others. Any specific task I could do with the\nknowledge would be far outweighed by the tasks done by those I\u2019d\nexplained the knowledge to.^[1](#fn:1)^ It was only after I\u2019d decided on\nthis course of action (and perhaps this is the blinders once again) that\nit struck me that explaining complicated ideas was actually something\nI\u2019d always loved doing and was really pretty good at.\n\nThat aside, having spent the morning reading David Foster\nWallace^[2](#fn:2)^, it is plain that I am no great writer. And so,\nreading Hardy, I am left wondering whether my decision is somehow\nirresponsible.\n\nI am saved, I think, because it appears that Hardy\u2019s logic to some\nextent parallels mine. Why is it important for the man who \u201ccan bat\nunusually well\u201d to become \u201ca professional cricketer\u201d? It is, presumably,\nbecause those who can bat unusually well are in short supply and so the\nfew who are gifted with that talent should do us all the favor of making\nuse of it. If those whose \u201cjudgment of the markets is quick and sound\u201d\nbecome cricketers, while the good batters become stockbrokers, we will\nend up with mediocre cricketers and mediocre stockbrokers. Better for\nall of us if the reverse is the case.\n\nBut this, of course, is awfully similar to the logic I myself employed.\nIt is important for me to spend my life explaining what I\u2019d learned\nbecause people who had learned it are in short supply \u2014 much shorter\nsupply, in fact (or so it appears), than people who can bat well.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHowever, there is also an assumption hidden in that statement. It only\nmakes sense to decide what to become based on what you can presently do\nif you believe that abilities are somehow granted innately and can\nmerely be cultivated, not created in themselves. This is a fairly common\nview, although rarely consciously articulated (as indeed Hardy takes it\nfor granted), but not one that I subscribe to.\n\nInstead, it seems plausible that talent is made through practice, that\nthose who are good batters are that way after spending enormous\nquantities of time batting as a kid.^[3](#fn:3)^ Mozart, for example,\nwas the son of \u201cone of Europe\u2019s leading musical teachers\u201d^[4](#fn:4)^\nand said teacher began music instruction at age three. While I am\nplainly no Mozart, several similarities do seem apparent. My father had\na computer programming company and he began showing me how to use the\ncomputer as far back as I can remember.\n\nThe extreme conclusion from the theory that there is no innate talent is\nthat there is no difference between people and thus, as much as\npossible, we should get people to do the most important tasks (writing,\nas opposed to cricket, let\u2019s say). But in fact this does not follow.\n\nLearning is like compound interest. A little bit of knowledge makes it\neasier to pick up more. Knowing what addition is and how to do it, you\ncan then read a wide variety of things that use addition, thus knowing\neven more and being able to use that knowledge in a similar\nmanner.^[5](#fn:5)^ And so, the growth in knowledge\naccelerates.^[6](#fn:6)^ This is why children who get started on\nsomething at a young age, as Mozart did, grow up to have such an\nadvantage.\n\nAnd even if (highly implausibly) we were able to control the\ncircumstances in which all children grew up so as to maximize their\nability to perform the most important tasks, that still would not be\nenough, since in addition to aptitude there is also interest.\n\nImagine the three sons of a famous football player. All three are raised\nsimilarly, with athletic activity from their earliest days, and thus\nhave an equal aptitude for playing football. Two of them pick up this\ntask excitedly, while one, despite being good at it, is\nuninterested^[7](#fn:7)^ and prefers to read books.^[8](#fn:8)^ It would\nnot only be unfair to force him to use his aptitude and play football,\nit would also be unwise. Someone whose heart isn\u2019t in it is unlikely to\nspend the time necessary to excel.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAnd this, in short^[9](#fn:9)^, is the position I find myself in. I\ndon\u2019t *want* to be a programmer. When I look at programming books, I am\nmore tempted to mock them than to read them. When I go to programmer\nconferences, I\u2019d rather skip out and talk politics than programming. And\nwriting code, although it can be enjoyable, is hardly something I want\nto spend my life doing.\n\nPerhaps, I fear, this decision deprives society of one great programmer\nin favor of one mediocre writer. And let\u2019s not hide behind the cloak of\nuncertainty, let\u2019s say we know that it does. Even so, I would make it.\nThe writing is too important, the programming too unenjoyable.\n\nAnd for that, I apologize.\n\n### Notes\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Explaining what that knowledge is, naturally, a larger project and\n    must wait for another time.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:1)\n\n2.  You can probably see DFW\u2019s influence on this piece, not least of\n    which in these footnotes.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:2)\n\n3.  Indeed, this apparently parallels the views of the psychologists who\n    have studied the question. Anders Ericsson, a psychology professor\n    who studies \u201cexpert performance\u201d, told the *New York Times Magazine*\n    that \u201cthe most general claim\u201d in his work \u201cis that a lot of people\n    believe there are some inherent limits they were born with. But\n    there is surprisingly little hard evidence \u2026 .\u201d The conclusion that\n    follows, the *NYTM* notes, is that \u201cwhen it comes to choosing a life\n    path, you should do what you love \u2014 because if you don\u2019t love it,\n    you are unlikely to work hard enough to get very good. Most people\n    naturally don\u2019t like to do things they aren\u2019t \u2018good\u2019 at. So they\n    often give up, telling themselves they simply don\u2019t possess the\n    talent for math or skiing or the violin. But what they really lack\n    is the desire to be good and to undertake the deliberate practice\n    that would make them\n    better.\u201d[\u2020](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.html?ex=1148875200&en=611751da74b96d1b&ei=5070)\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:3)\n\n4.  The quote is [from\n    Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart)\n    where, indeed, the other facts are drawn from as well, the idea\n    having been suggested by Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s essay \u201cMozart and\n    Modularity\u201d, collected in his book *Eight Little\n    Piggies*.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:4)\n\n5.  I\u2019ve always thought that this was the reason kids (or maybe just me)\n    especially disliked history. Every other field \u2014 biology, math, art\n    \u2014 had at least some connection to the present and thus kids had some\n    foundational knowledge to build on. But history? We simply weren\u2019t\n    there and thus know absolutely nothing of it.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:5)\n\n6.  It was tempting to write that \u201cthe rate of growth\u201d accelerates, but\n    that would mean something rather different.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:6)\n\n7.  Many people, of course, are uninterested in such things precisely\n    because they aren\u2019t very good at them. There\u2019s nothing like repeated\n    failures to turn you way from an activity. Perhaps this is another\n    reason to start young \u2014 young children might be less stung by\n    failure, as little is expected from them.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:7)\n\n8.

Felten and his team broke it and was about to publish a\npaper explaining how, when the recording industry threatened to sue him\nif he did.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s offered expert opinions on everything from Microsoft to\nvoting machines and started the Center for Information Technology Policy\nat Princeton, which he directs, where he\u2019s pushed for more government\ntransparency. He has the incredibly rare combination of being an\nabsolutely first-rate technologist while also being able to clearly\nexplain all of the relevant policy implications.

My friends praise\nhis attacks on television and rethinking of education. But it\u2019s hard for\nme to take him seriously after reading his *The Disappearance of\nChildhood*, in which he argues (p. 87) that television is bad because it\nteaches children homosexuality is normal and praises the Moral Majority\nas being the only group to realize this important truth. And true, he\nadmits it\u2019s an exaggeration to say \u201csuch a situation necessarily and\ncategorically signifies cultural degeneration\u201d, he does insist it\nclearly \u201cposes dangers\u201d.\n\nPostman\u2019s argument is that childhood is the creation of the printing\npress, which led to a culture in which learning to read was necessary to\nbecome an adult, and thus children became a separate group. In the same\nway, he argues, the emergence of television, which requires no special\ntraining to view, is destroying the distinction between children and\nadults and bringing us back to that pre-literate age.\n\nNot once does Postman ever explain why this should be considered a bad\nthing. Instead, his book simply assumes it\u2019s obvious that we need to\npretend to keep kids from naughty words (even though they know them\nanyway), that we need to make it hard for kids to learn about sex, that\nwe need to pretend for them that political leaders are infallible, etc.\n\nOne is almost tempted to believe the book is tounge-in-cheek, an\nimpression assisted by the preface to the second edition \u2014 the only\nplace where actual children are ever considered \u2014 which quotes letters\nPostman has received from students who have read portions of the book\nand disagree completely with his argument that childhood is\ndisappearing. They don\u2019t, however, criticize childhood itself, so\nPostman assumes they are in favor of it and praises them as \u201ca force in\npreserving childhood\u201d, a sort of \u201cmoral majority\u201d.\n\nAnd this, in miniature, is the problem with the whole book. Postman\ninvestigates the history of childhood and modern thought, finding it a\ncreation of the printing press, and thus a social and not a biological\nentity. But instead of investigating whether the result was good or bad,\nhe simply ignores his own work and proceeds directly to assuming it must\nbe good. What we are witnessing here is not the disappearance of\nchildhood, but the disappearance of thought.\n\n[image1_postmankid]: image1_postmankid.jpg", "external_links": ["http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0679751661.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"], "time": 1138435200.0, "postid": "postmankid", "internal_links": []}, "judgmentday": {"post_title": "Judgment Day", "tags": [], "post_content": "Judgment Day\n============\n\nDecember 10, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/judgmentday)\n\n* * * * *\n\nPeople don\u2019t like being told that they\u2019re bad.

[Doctors Without Borders\nreports](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/i2006/index.cfm)\nthat they treated 10 million people last year, treating 26,000 people\nfrom cholera, for example, and treating 63,000 children for\nmalnutrition. Even the most vocal critics of aid, like William Easterly,\nwho has written many books and op-eds attacking government aid programs\nas unhelpful, has to concede that private projects like Oxfam and UNICEF\nare successful and positive. Nobody, of course, provides any real\nargument against these things. They just say it\u2019s \u201ctoo unclear\u201d.\n\nIf that\u2019s the real issue, then [donate to an organization like Poverty\nAction Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/) at MIT.

Of course, this is an irrelevance. Nobody is trying to put\nhim on trial \u2014 just arguing he should do more to help.\n\nBut Barry goes one step further: he says that he should not help because\ngiving his money to starving people would lead to \u201clack of incentive to\ncompete, lack of investment base for risky & experimental ventures, and\ncongealing layers of bureaucracy feeding on income redistribution.\u201d\nTaking this at face value for a moment, it is not clear to me why why\nsaving people from starvation would cause the first two \u2014 wouldn\u2019t there\nbe a huge incentive to compete for saving lives and trying new\nexperimental techniques in doing so? Perhaps Barry means that the\nfirst-world might have less competition in a field like, say, luxury\nwatches. I don\u2019t see this as a tragedy. It amazes me that someone would\nadmit that they prefer to have millions of people starve to death than\nto have a complicated bureaucracy.\n\nIn response, [Barry\nexplains](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall#c7) that \u201cthere\nneeds to be a cost-benefit analysis\u201d. He does not explain what he wants\nto analyze. Should we make a little chart with the benefits of\ncompetition in the luxury watch market on one side and the benefits of\nsaving people from starvation on the other?\n\nHe also argues that we should do nothing about starvation because many\npeople die in car accidents. I am not sure how this is relevant, but I\ndeplore the deaths of people in car accidents and personally do not\ndrive because of it.\n\n[Sohail provides](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall#c11) the\namazing argument that one shouldn\u2019t donate to UNICEF because \u201cThey have\na business model that revolves around needy people. To keep the model\ngoing, you need needy people.\u201d It is not clear how this principle is\nsupposed to work. Are the people at UNICEF supposed to be quietly\nsabotaging their efforts in order to preserve their jobs?

[As Wikipedia\nsummarizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?oldid=211296230):\n\n> In his work, Wegener presented a large amount of circumstantial\n> evidence in support of continental drift, but he was unable to come up\n> with a convincing mechanism. Thus, while his ideas attracted a few\n> early supporters \u2026 the hypothesis was generally met with skepticism.\n> The one American edition of Wegener\u2019s work \u2026 was received so poorly\n> that the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organized a\n> symposium specifically in opposition\u2026. \u2026 By the 1930s, Wegener\u2019s\n> geological work was almost universally dismissed by the scientific\n> community and remained obscure for some thirty years.\n\nToday, of course, every schoolchild knows about Pangea. But for a long\ntime the theory was dismissed, not because it lacked evidence or\npredictive power \u2014 it explained why the shapes of the continents fit\ntogether, why mountain ranges and coal fields lined up, why similar\nfossil were found in places separated by oceans, and so on \u2014 but because\nWegener had no plausible mechanism.\n\nA similar problem happens in the social sciences. [Paul Krugman recently\nnoted](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/bartels-alfred-wegener/)\nthat while Larry Bartels (in his new book [*Unequal\nDemocracy*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637)) provides solid,\nconvincing evidence that Republican presidents systematically preside\nover slower growth and increasing inequality, most social scientists\ndon\u2019t believe him because we haven\u2019t yet identified the mechanisms.\nKrugman:\n\n> Now, I\u2019m a big Bartels fan; I\u2019ve known about this result for quite a\n> while. But I\u2019ve never written it up. Why? Because I can\u2019t figure out a\n> plausible mechanism. Even though I believe that politics has a big\n> effect on income distribution, this is just too strong \u2014 and too\n> immediate \u2014 for me to see how it can be done. Sure, Republicans want\n> an oligarchic society \u2014 but how can they do that?\n\nBartels, for his part, [argues\nthat](http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m8664.html) providing the\nmechanisms isn\u2019t his job \u2014 his goal is to highlight the phenomena and\nencourage many others to research the mechanisms:\n\n> *How do presidents produce these substantial effects?*\n>\n> One of my aims in writing *Unequal Democracy* was to prod economists\n> and policy analysts to devote more attention to precisely that\n> question. Douglas Hibbs did important work along these lines \u2026 He\n> found that Democrats favored expansionary policies \u2026 while Republicans\n> endured and sometimes prolonged recessions in order to keep inflation\n> in check. (Not coincidentally, unemployment mostly affects income\n> growth among relatively poor people, while inflation mostly affects\n> income growth among relatively affluent people.) In recent decades\n> taxes and transfers have probably been more important. Social\n> spending. Business regulation or lack thereof. And don\u2019t forget the\n> minimum wage. Over the past 60 years, the real value of the minimum\n> wage has increased by 16 cents per year under Democratic presidents\n> and declined by 6 cents per year under Republican presidents; that\u2019s a\n> 3% difference in average income growth for minimum wage workers, with\n> ramifications for many more workers higher up the wage scale. So,\n> while I don\u2019t pretend to understand all the ways in which presidents\u2019\n> policy choices shape the income distribution, I see little reason to\n> doubt that the effects are real and substantial.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing such arguments more generally, the most\nfamous commentator is Jon Elster. In his classic article \u201c[Marxism,\nFunctionalism, and Game\nTheory](http://www.geocities.com/hmelberg/elster/AR82MFGT.HTM)\u201d, he\ninsists:\n\n> Without a firm knowledge about the mechanisms that operate at the\n> individual level, the grand Marxist claims about macrostructures and\n> long-term change are condemned to remain at the level of speculation.\n\n(To be fair, Elster doesn\u2019t make this as a general argument, but his\nvehemence has led some of his followers to suggest that it is.)\n\nTo be clear, I think discovering mechanisms is important work. All I\u2019m\narguing is that it shouldn\u2019t be a necessity for believing in a theory.\nInstead, I believe it\u2019s an irrational side-effect of an emotional\ndistaste for gaps in knowledge.\n\nAs evidence, let me note that such demands for mechanisms never go more\nthan one level deep. Nobody has ever said, \u201cWell, your theory that\npeople are motivated by greed is all very nice, but I just can\u2019t believe\nit until you can explain how greed is manifested in the brain.\u201d\nNeuroscience is obviously the microfoundation of psychology, but\npsychological theories are regularly accepted without neuroscientific\nmicrofoundations.\n\nIn general, it seems like such commentators support a double-standard.\nTheories with mechanisms should be judged by their fit with the evidence\nand predictive power. Theories without mechanisms should be judged by\nthe evidence and predictive power and whether you can think of any\nplausible mechanisms. I don\u2019t see how this can be justified. There\u2019s no\nreason mechanism should be privileged in the assessment of knowledge;\nthings are true or false, even if we don\u2019t know *why* they are true or\nfalse.\n\nIndeed, it we typically only investigate the causes of phenomena once\nwe\u2019re convinced that they exist. (Elster admits as much in *Explaining\nSocial Behavior*, noting that establishing a phenomena\u2019s existence is\nthe first step towards explaining it.) So let\u2019s stop making the mistake\nof not believing things are true because we don\u2019t know how they happen.\n", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?oldid=211296230", "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/bartels-alfred-wegener/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637", "http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m8664.html", "http://www.geocities.com/hmelberg/elster/AR82MFGT.HTM"], "time": 1210748400.0, "postid": "microfoundations", "internal_links": []}, "smalltalkq": {"post_title": "The Smalltalk Question", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Smalltalk Question\n======================\n\nAugust 16, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the minor puzzles of American life is what question to ask people\nat parties and suchly to get to know them.\n\n\u201cHow ya doin\u2019?\u201d is of course mere formality, only the most troubled\nwould answer honestly for anything but the positive.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d is somewhat offensive.

He\u2019d made\nmillions starting a string of companies, including [an air cargo\ncarrier](http://www.astaraircargo.us/), [a D.C.\nrestaurant](http://www.leparadou.net/), [a D.C. art\ngallery](http://www.zenithgallery.com/), and [a real estate information\ndatabase](http://www.costargroup.com/). But then Klein\u2019s son, aghast at\nthe horrors of his government under Bush II, fled the country. Or, as\nKlein put it in [an interview with the Harvard Law School Alumni\nBulletin](http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/closing.php),\n\u201cMy two sons led me to realize that a significant part of their\ngeneration thinks democracy isn\u2019t worth engagement or even respect. For\nan old 1960s activist like myself, that was the tipping point.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s natural for a father to want to fix things for his sons (and\nperhaps for a wealthy D.C. lawyer to feel a bit guilty about it as\nwell), so Klein, leaning a bit more on his corporate millions than his\nsixties activism, started a foundation. Taking its name from Justice\nBrandeis\u2019s famed comment that \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of\ndisinfectants\u201d, the [Sunlight\nFoundation](http://www.opensecrets.org/pressreleases/2003/SpeakingFreely.asp)\nwas formed to promote transparency and accountability in American\ngovernment.\n\nMost such organizations would do this by running investigations and\npublishing reports, but the Sunlight Foundation decided to take a\ndifferent tack. Instead, [as Klein put\nit](http://www.mikeklein.com/text.html), Sunlight would \u201cbe utilizing\n21st Century information technology, and Web 2.0 energy\u201d.\n\nThe Foundation was formed in January 2006 and, thanks to Klein, was\nquickly swimming in cash. Their first major project was\n[Congresspedia](http://www.congresspedia.org/), a Wikipedia-like site to\nkeep track of information on members of Congress. Unlike most Web 2.0\nsites, they bought large ads on the major political weblogs to promote\nthe new site. (Despite this blanket promotion \u2014 and the hiring of a\nfull-time editor \u2014 the site seems to have about the same level of\nactivity as the [They Might Be Giants wiki](http://www.tmbw.net/).)\n\nSome of their other projects are about what you\u2019d expect: [a federal\nfunding-Google Maps mashup](http://sunlightlabs.com/earmarks/), [a\nCongressional tag\ncloud](http://sunlightlabs.com/widgets/doc/widget_sunlightfoundationtagcloud.php),\n[a video contest](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/1219) mocking\nof members of Congress who don\u2019t release their schedules. (They\u2019ve also\ndonated money to already-existing related projects, many of which are\ndoing valuable work.)\n\nTheir most recent project was an invite-only conference in San Francisco\nto bring together the leaders in this nascent field. (Disclosure: I\nattended and just about everyone there from the Sunlight Foundation\ninvited me to take their money.) Funder Klein hailed the Foundation as\nthe most important and fastest-growing project he\u2019d ever started, while\nexecutive director Ellen Miller noted that this year they\u2019d launched\nseveral projects, all of which had been successes. (Afterwards I asked\nher what her metric for success was. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing stuff up on the\nwall and seeing what sticks,\u201d she explained. And success, I confirmed,\nmeans \u201cit hasn\u2019t completely fallen apart yet\u201d.)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs a Web 2.0 developer, it\u2019s hard for me to see how even the best Web\n2.0 site can have much of a positive impact on government. Genuinely\npromoting transparency requires the hard work of doing investigative\nresearch, publishing reports, and promoting them to the media. Bubble\n2.0 hype aside, the fanciest pop-up windows and and Google Maps mashups\nwon\u2019t change that.\n\nThe attendees seemed to begin to recognize this. In a breakout session\non reaching users, a guru from Web 2.0 consultancy [Adaptive\nPath](http://adaptivepath.com/) tried to walk us through their user\nexperience process. \u201cRemember,\u201d she told us, \u201cthese sites aren\u2019t about\nwhat *you* want to do; they\u2019re about improving the lives of your users\nby connecting with their *real needs*.\u201d We gave our example user a name\n(Jane) and backstory (too busy driving her kids to care about politics,\nbut upset at the high gas prices she has to pay). And that\u2019s where we\ngot stuck. Is Jane really going to muddle through graphs generated from\nFEC reporting data?\n\nWe decided our saviors would be the \u201cPaul Reveres\u201d \u2014 the people who care\nenough about politics to slog through the data and then mass email their\nfriends when they find something good (we concluded that going after\nnewspaper reporters was too Web 1.0). They would save us from having to\nwrite reports or take positions; all we had to do was make the data\navailable and let them do the rest.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are a handful of people who actually do this, but it\nseems like we\u2019re spending an awful lot to build a site just for them.\nAnd even then, what impact will they have? Even if our Paul Revere finds\nthe smokingest of smoking guns and posts it on their extremely popular\nblog, without a larger political platform it will only fuel the cynicism\nthat Klein claims he\u2019s trying to combat. (\u201cThere they go again,\u201d the\nreader thinks, and hits the back button.)\n\nEven if Klein is for some reason averse to taking an actual political\nstand (maybe he doesn\u2019t vote the same way as his sons?), there\u2019s still\nmuch to be done. Several people in the session were from the group that\nruns [the opensecrets.org website](http://opensecrets.org/), which\ndetails who contributes to which campaign. It\u2019s useful stuff, but even a\nhundred of their reports can\u2019t compare to their old-fashioned,\ndead-trees book [*Speaking\nFreely*](http://www.opensecrets.org/pressreleases/2003/SpeakingFreely.asp),\nwhich brilliantly details the big picture of how money politics actually\nworks. The author of the book, Larry Makinson, was in the room, but\ninstead of figuring out how to tell more stories like that, he was busy\nworrying about how to make specific numbers come alive.\n\nBut what makes *Speaking Freely* so brilliant is that it shows specifics\naren\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s not that donors bribe politicians into changing\ntheir vote \u2014 they rarely do \u2014 it\u2019s that the entire campaign finance\nsystem forces all our public officials to bend and scrape before\nbig-money donors, instead of actually listening to the voters.\n\nSuch clear analysis makes the solution clear as well: we need to get rid\nof privately-financed elections altogether. And, in fact, there is an\norganization doing just that. It\u2019s called [Public\nCampaign](http://www.publicampaign.org/) and, considering the enormous\nodds it\u2019s up against, it\u2019s having incredible success. (Arizona,\nConnecticut, and Maine have all adopted clean elections and smaller\nprojects have been started in six more states.) But the Sunlight\nFoundation isn\u2019t giving money to Public Campaign. To the contrary, many\nof its top people used to work there.\n\nPublic Campaign is just one example; the larger point is that just as\nWeb 2.0 pixie dust doesn\u2019t automatically make your web site into a\nsuccess, just making important data available won\u2019t cause political\nchange. Justice Brandeis\u2019s clever aphorism to the contrary, sunlight is\nnot in fact the best disinfectant; actual disinfectant is. Sunlight just\nmakes it easier for people to look at the pus.\n\n* * * * *\n\n**The Sunlight Foundation responds:** Many people from the Sunlight\nFoundation have thoughtfully written to me. Aside from our general\ndisagreement about the value of the projects Sunlight engages in, they\nmake several specific points. Since they haven\u2019t provided any letters\nfor publication, I\u2019ll try to summarize them as fairly as I can:\n\n-   **It\u2019s not \u201ca zero-sum game\u201d.** The open data work that Sunlight\n    funds helps projects like Public Campaign by giving them ammunition.\n    Center for Responsive Politics data makes it into corruption stories\n    in newspapers which, in turn, has made the issue of clean elections\n    a more serious part of the public debate.\n\n-   **Sunlight has many other projects.** They\u2019ve provided serious\n    grants to a number of organizations \u2014 including the [Center for\n    Responsive Politics](http://www.opensecrets.org/) \u2014 and have a\n    number of projects, including [hiring some\n    bloggers](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/blog/), doing\n    distributed journalism on [Congress\u2019s Family\n    Business](http://www.sunlightlabs.com/research/familybusiness/),\n    getting 90 candidates to sign [their Punch Clock\n    Agreeement](http://www.sunlightnetwork.com/punchclock), and even\n    writing [an old-fashioned\n    report](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/daysinsession).\n\n-   **Sunlight has a good relation with Public Campaign.** Mike Klein\n    has made donations to Public Campaign on his own; Ellen Miller\n    started Public Campaign but left long before she joined Sunlight;\n    Micah Sifry was already lowering the amount of time he spent working\n    for Public Campaign before he joined Sunlight.\n\nI don\u2019t dispute any of these points, but I think the brunt of my\ncritique still stands. Changes to the culture of Washington must be\nstructural ones. These projects, while fun, fundamentally misunderstand\nhow institutions operate.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.mikeklein.com/", "http://www.wilmerhale.com/michael_klein/", "http://www.astaraircargo.us/", "http://www.leparadou.net/", "http://www.zenithgallery.com/", "http://www.costargroup.com/", "http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/closing.php", "http://www.opensecrets.org/pressreleases/2003/SpeakingFreely.asp", "http://www.mikeklein.com/text.html", "http://www.congresspedia.org/", "http://www.tmbw.net/", "http://sunlightlabs.com/earmarks/", "http://sunlightlabs.com/widgets/doc/widget_sunlightfoundationtagcloud.php", "http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/1219", "http://adaptivepath.com/", "http://opensecrets.org/", "http://www.opensecrets.org/pressreleases/2003/SpeakingFreely.asp", "http://www.publicampaign.org/", "http://www.opensecrets.org/", "http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/blog/", "http://www.sunlightlabs.com/research/familybusiness/", "http://www.sunlightnetwork.com/punchclock", "http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/daysinsession"], "time": 1164009600.0, "postid": "dissunlight", "internal_links": []}, "individualscience": {"post_title": "Individuals in a World of Science", "tags": ["science", "education"], "post_content": "Individuals in a World of Science\n=================================\n\nApril 6, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/individualscience)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWe are all the same, we are all different\u2014this is the great modern\ndilemma. At the same time science and technology lets us see our\npatterns (guess what books we\u2019ll like without ever meeting us, predict\nthe probability with which a certain drug will have a certain side\neffect) our social independence encourages us to believe we cannot be so\neasily controlled (thus millions of people watching the same TV ad\ninsisting they \u201cthink different\u201d).\n\nThe tension can be felt most acutely in medicine, where a long and\nstoried tradition of individualism (each patient is unique, with their\nown symptoms and history and makeup) confronts the most expensive\nproducts of modern megascience (every pill of a drug is the same, its\nworkings validated through a test on thousands of people). And then you\nhave doctors, caught in the middle: what are they to be\u2014brilliant\nindividuals, cunningly solving problems on their own (or, more\nrealistically, with a small team) or dutiful cogs, administering the\ntreatments shown most effective by large experiments?\n\nFor every individual person, you can come up with a story about why the\nlarger results may not apply (most of the people in that study were\nyoung and healthy, but you are old and frail). But that just replaces\nhard science with educated suspicion. On the whole what was proven true\non the whole must work better, right?\n\nThis is the position of evidence-based medicine, which says that doctors\ncan\u2019t be trusted to make these decisions by themselves. Unduly swayed by\nwhim and bias, bribed in endless ways by the manufacturers of expensive\ndrugs and tools, incentivized to give themselves more business, EBM\nproponents say we must take these choices out of their hands and give\nthem to a panel of experts, who can review with time and distance what\nsolid scientific studies say actually works and does not.\n\nI\u2019ve made it sound like I\u2019m on the side of the scientific mass, but I\u2019m\nreally not. Is there any evidence that evidence-based medicine really\nworks? Everything I\u2019ve seen is shockingly inconclusive.\n\nThere have been big benefits from smaller interventions\u2014giving doctors\ntools to encourage them to do the right things. Atul Gawande has been\nthe greatest chronicler of such programs, from forceful [reminders to\nwash your hands](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312427654) to careful\n[checklists before surgery](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312430000). But\nfor the most part such programs aid doctors, not overrule them. This is\ngood politics, but it\u2019s also good science: everyone rebels against\ndirect instruction.\n\nI think we have a choice to make. Doctors can be simply told what to\ndo\u2014in which case, why require all those years of med school? why not\nwrite down all the rules and instructions and let any random nurse\nfollow them?\u2014or they can be taught the lessons of the science but\nallowed to practice it on their own. They can be show their own human\nfrailties and biases, the huge value that comes from following the\nproven rules, trained in the common fallacies of probability\nandstatistics, but in the end, allowed to make the final judgment for\nthemselves. We can screen out those who fail to learn these lessons, but\nif we can\u2019t, at the end of the process, trust them to make their own\ndecisions, why even bother to have doctors at all?\n\n* * * * *\n\nMedicine is the field where this is clearest, but the same tension has\ncome to teaching as well\u2014every student is the same, every student is\ndifferent. We once allowed each teacher to direct their classroom in\ntheir own way, but high-stakes tests and \u201cvalue-added\u201d measurements now\nforce all of them into the same mold.\n\nIsn\u2019t this a good thing, demands Matt Yglesias? We have science that\nshows good teaching can make a huge difference in people\u2019s lives\u2014doesn\u2019t\neveryone deserve the benefits that come from having a good teacher? He\ndismisses the stories of the individual horrors that result from this\nprocess as mere anecdote\u2014inevitably in imposing a one-size-fits-all\nsolution there will be some negative side effects for a few, but the\nbenefits for the many outweigh the costs. Again, I have tried to put\nthis position in its most favorable light (I hope Matt will correct me\nif I\u2019ve failed) but I\u2019m flabbergasted by its callous naivet\u00e9. The\nproblem with allowing hard incentive systems to squeeze out individual\njudgment is inevitably that people begin trying to game the system\u2014they\ncheat on the tests, they coach students on the answers, they cut recess\nand art for more drill-and-skill. To dismiss [the on-the-ground\nevidence](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024) of how badly these\ntests hurt kids, in favor of some Olympian view of the benefits of\nrising test scores, is ludicrous when the on-the-ground view is telling\nyou *the test scores are actually bogus*.\n\nFine, Matt says, that just means we need to crack down on cheating.\n(This is always the first response of the incentive designer\u2014we just\nneed to improve the incentive system!) The fact that a couple teachers\ncheat on their students\u2019 tests is no reason to give up on all the\nbenefits better teachers can being. And that\u2019s true, but blatant\ncheating is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn medicine, we can at least measure whether people get healthy. A\ndoctor with some radical new treatment can prove she\u2019s right by testing\nit against the previous best answer and showing it works better. And we\nwant brilliant teachers to do the same: to come up with innovative new\nways of teaching students and prove they work better than the old stale\nsystem. But the ultimate goal of school is much less clear and more\ndisputed\u2014is it to create orderly little capitalist worker bees or\ncurious independent thinkers?\n\nMatt says *please, we don\u2019t need to enter into this debate. I\u2019m only\ntalking about the fundamentals\u2014basic literacy and arithmetic.* But I\ndon\u2019t think that really helps. What good is learning to read if, by the\nend, you hate doing it?\n\nOne solution is to measure students by real results, rather than\nartificial tests. Can a child read and understand? Ask them to tell you\nabout the books they\u2019ve read lately. (This was how my library\u2019s summer\nreading program tested whether you actually read the books you claimed.\nApparently I didn\u2019t understand most of *Snow Crash* as a kid, but I\nloved reading it anyway.) Or, better yet, ask them a question that\ninvolves doing some research and see if they can look up and read the\nanswer.\n\nFor math, ask them to build something that involves a little\ncalculation, or make change, or any of the real-world activities these\nisolated skills are supposed to be actually useful for. What you learn\nfrom that will be much more revealing than which bubbles kids fill in on\na sheet.\n\nThe other alternative is to put your trust in teachers, to assume they\ncan tell the difference between a class that\u2019s learning and a class that\nisn\u2019t, and then give them a chance to do better. Take them to some of\nthe best-run classes in the world and let them absorb the lessons for\nthemselves. Have them meet regularly with their fellow teachers and\ndiscuss how they can make their teaching better. This is the humane\nresponse to those who want to reduce teaching to a rote question of\nmerely reading off a script (no joke\u2014this is literally what happens in\nthe most test-driven schools\u2026because, after all, science shows the\nscript is best for test scores).\n\nIn both cases, I sympathize with the humane aims: I don\u2019t want doctors\nto become shills for pharmaceutical companies, I don\u2019t want poor kids to\ngrow up unable to read. But I blanch at the inhumane means proposed to\ncarry them out. As *[Seeing Like a\nState](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0300078153)* describes, the history\nof high modernist utopian projects has not been a pretty one.

If\nthe girl across the street peers through your window to watch you\nundress, we might say that was bad and wrong and awful, but I don\u2019t\nthink anyone would try to claim it was evil. Evil is a really strong\nterm!\n\nNow part of the joke is that Google seems to be using it rather loosely.\nIf you look at [their\nexamples](http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/tenthings.html)\nof evil deeds, they seem rather mundane compared to cackling\nsupervillains and mass murderers. They specifically name three: showing\nirrelevant ads, using pop-ups or other annoying gimmicks, and selling\noff actual search results.\n\nHardly the stuff of comic books. But what do these three have in common?\n**They\u2019re all instances of refusing to make things worse for your users\nin order to make more money.** Perhaps that still seems like a mundane\nconception of evil, but I think it gets at something important. Evil\nisn\u2019t just about doing terrible things \u2014 it\u2019s about doing terrible\nthings for bad reasons. The evil villain cackles and brags about how\nthey\u2019re on the side of evil \u2014 they explicitly oppose doing good. And\nthis definition of evil is all about that: if you\u2019re working against\nyour own users, you must have crossed the line and joined the other\nside.\n\nWhen you stop to think about it, it\u2019s wild how many companies have done\njust that: Printer manufacturers who put chips on their ink cartridges,\nso you can\u2019t refill or recycle them but instead have to buy a new\nfull-price cartridge. Apple preventing the Kindle app from having any\nsort of ebook buying functionality. Web publishers who break articles up\ninto 20 pages so that you have to load 20 different ads just to read one\narticle. These are pretty banal evils, but it\u2019s striking that I can\u2019t\nthink of any example where Google has done anything like that. (Perhaps\nsomeone will name one I\u2019ve missed in the comments.)\n\nThere are lots of things I disagree with Google about \u2014 the most recent\nbeing their refusal to [let my friends with chosen\nnames](http://my.nameis.me/) use Google+ \u2014 but those things aren\u2019t evil\nby this definition. For example, Google\n[defends](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/08/nym-wars/) their real names\npolicy by saying it\u2019ll lead to better conversations. They still claim to\nbe fighting for the user.\n\nSo if you want to argue with Google, that\u2019s the way to do it: don\u2019t say\nthat they\u2019re hurting someone out there in the world or violating some\nrule or principle, say that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t serving their\nusers.

The top-selling paper in the\ncountry, *USA Today*, distributes only 2 million copies a day (half, no\ndoubt, placed outside hotel room doors). Around the same number, with an\naverage age of 71, watch *The O\u2019Reilly Factor* nightly, with the number\ndecreasing as the audience dies off. Everyone quietly concedes the news\nindustry is dying. It\u2019s the Internet\u2019s fault, they all assure us.\n\nBut what if it wasn\u2019t? The other day I heard a news program that was so\ngood that I wanted to listen to it again. And I\u2019m not alone \u2014 all my\nfriends have been talking about it as well. And while I don\u2019t have exact\nnumbers, it seems as popular as any one of those other news outlets.\nThat show? The *This American Life* episode on [The Global Pool of\nMoney](http://thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355) \u2014 a\ncomprehensive explanation of the housing mess.\n\nThere were three things about the show that made it stand out from the\nrest of the news pack:\n\n1.  **It believed in the intelligence of its audience.** It didn\u2019t try\n    to pander with sex or disasters or quick cuts. It took a serious\n    news story and investigated it thoroughly for a full hour, with only\n    one break. And it didn\u2019t try and dumb any of it down \u2014 it explained\n    the whole thing, from top to bottom.\n\n2.  **It didn\u2019t assume you already knew the subject.** Most news stories\n    on important topics are incomprehensible to the average person who\n    doesn\u2019t know much about their topic. Here\u2019s a quote from a random\n    news story about the housing crisis: \u201cThey said financial\n    institutions have been unwilling to expose themselves to the\n    mortgage market, and lenders are hesitant to lend to risky borrowers\n    in a declining house price market after the subprime meltdown.\u201d\n    Unless you\u2019ve been following the story (like the reporter,\n    presumably) do you really know what that means? *TAL* instead\n    assumed you knew nothing and explained every component and term so\n    that you actually had a picture of what was going on.\n\n3.  **It was done in an entertaining and conversational tone.** It\n    didn\u2019t treat the news as some important series of facts that had to\n    be seriously conveyed to you. It treated it as something interesting\n    they wanted to tell you about, a story that involved real people\u2019s\n    lives (who you got to hear from at length) and was full of genuinely\n    interesting pieces. Look at that news quote above one more time. Can\n    you really imagine someone sitting down and saying that with a\n    straight face?\n\nAt first these things may seem contradictory \u2014 how can you believe in\nthe intelligence of your audience while assuming they don\u2019t know\nanything? how can you be entertaining and yet still explain a subject? \u2014\nbut the more you think about them you see how well they fit together.\nBeing intelligent doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re knowledgeable; it means you\u2019re\ncurious. Which means you want to hear the whole story from beginning to\nend and which means you might actually find it entertaining. And being\nconversational prevents you from assuming the mask that lets you talk\ndown to your audience while pretending they only need to hear the\nhandful of new facts that you\u2019re providing.\n\nIn every other field, that kind of formality has been dropped. Even\nbanks run advertisements these days about how their associates will be\nyour friend. And yet the news chugs along with its arrogant formality,\nwatching its audience get older and older, and wondering why its\ncirculation is declining.\n\nTogether, these three points seem like the recipe for a genuine news\nshow: intelligent, comprehensive, and entertaining. And yet, I can\u2019t\nthink of a single thing that follows them. Surely in an era of\ndesperation and experimentation, the wacky idea of actually respecting\nyour audience has to be worth a try by *someone*.

Now when I meet people they don\u2019t\nrecognize me \u2014 they wait until I introduce myself or sort of stare at me\nblankly before they realize who I am \u2014 that never used to happen before.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m here to check out the iCommons summit.

The reason why it\u2019s a bad idea should\nbe obvious: truth is independent of our beliefs, no less than any other\npartisans, centrists ignore evidence in favor of their predetermined\nideology.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction? First, it requires little thought: arguing for\na specific position requires collecting evidence and arguing for it.\nCentrism, simply requires repeating some of what A is saying and some of\nwhat B is saying and mixing them together. Centrists often don\u2019t even\nseem to care if the bits they take contradict each other.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s somewhat inoffensive. Taking a strong stand on A or B will\nunavoidably alienate some. But being a centrist, one can still maintain\nfriends on both sides, since they will find at least some things that\nyou espouse to be agreeable with their own philosophies.\n\nThird, it makes it easier to suck up to those in charge, because the\nconcept of the \u201ccenter\u201d can easily move along with shifts in power. A\nstaunch conservative will have to undergo a major change of political\nphilosophy to get a place in liberal administration. A centrist can\nsimply espouse a few more positions from the conservatives and a few\nless from the liberals and fit in just fine. This criteria explains why\ncentrists are so prevalent in the pundit class (neither administration\nis tempted to really force them out) and why so many \u201ccentrist\u201d pundits\nespouse mostly conservative ideas these days (the conservatives are in\npower).\n\nFourth, despite actually being a servant of those in power, centrism\ngives one the illusion of actually being a serious, independent thinker.\n\u201cPeople on the right and on the left already know what they\u2019re going to\nsay on every issue,\u201d they might claim, \u201cbut we centrists make decisions\nbased on the situation.\u201d (This excuse was recently used in a fundraising\nletter by *The New Republic*.) Of course, the \u201csituation\u201d that\u2019s used to\nmake these decisions is simply who\u2019s currently in power, as discussed\nabove, but that part is carefully omitted.\n\nFifth, it appeals to the public. There\u2019s tremendous dissatisfaction\namong the public with the government and our system of politics. Despite\nbeing precisely in the middle of this corrupt system, centrists can\nclaim that they\u2019re actually \u201cindependents\u201d and \u201cdisagree with both the\nleft and the right\u201d. They can denounce \u201cextremism\u201d (which isn\u2019t very\npopular) and play the \u201cmoderate\u201d, even when their positions are\nextremely far from what the public believes or what the facts say.\n\nTogether, these reasons combine to make centrism an especially\nattractive place to be in American politics. But the disease is far from\nlimited to politics. Journalists frequently suggest the truth lies\nbetween the two opposing sources they\u2019ve quoted. Academics try to\ndistance themselves from policy positions proposed by either party. And,\nperhaps worst of all, scientists try to split the difference between two\ncompeting theories.\n\nUnfortunately for them, neither the truth nor the public necessarily\nlies somewhere in the middle. Fortunately for them, more valuable\nrewards do.\n\nExercise for the reader: What\u2019s the attraction of \u201ccontrarianism\u201d, the\nideology subscribed to by online magazines like *Slate*?\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1152687600.0, "postid": "whycentrism", "internal_links": []}, "whowritescomments": {"post_title": "Who Writes Wikipedia? \u2014 Responses", "tags": [], "post_content": "Who Writes Wikipedia? \u2014 Responses\n=================================\n\nSeptember 5, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowritescomments)\n\n* * * * *\n\n([back to Who writes\nWikipedia?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia))\n\nFirst, on a personal note, let me simply say thanks. I probably put more\nwork yesterday\u2019s post than anything else I\u2019ve ever written. In addition\nto the research I describe, I\u2019ve spent my free time the past few weeks\ngoing over the text of the article again and again, agonizing about the\nproper phrasing, getting everything just right. It was definitely worth\nit. My sincere thanks to everyone who made it possible.\n\nFurther research is needed\n--------------------------\n\nGetting down to business, many are interested in pursuing this line of\nquantitative research. The work I did was intended for an article, not a\nformal paper, and while I\u2019m fairly confident the basic principles are\ncorrect there\u2019s plenty more work to be done.\n\nI was heartened to discover research by Seth Anthony which,\nindependently and more formally, came to largely the same conclusions.\n[As he explained on Reddit](http://reddit.com/info/g9si/comments/cgc62):\n\u201cOnly about 10% of all edits on Wikipedia actually add substantive\ncontent. Roughly a third of those edits are made by someone without an\naccount, half of someone without a userpage (a minimal threshhold for\nconsidering whether someone is part of the \u201ccommunity\u201d). The average\ncontent-adder has less than 200 edits: much less, in many cases.\u201d\n\nOne of the more interesting things Anthony did was look at the work of\nadmins in detail. In his sample, he noticed that none of the genuinely\nsubstantive edits were done by official site admins. He found that when\nadmins originally joined the site, they contributed a lot less\nfrequently and consistently but created a lot more substantive content.\nAfter they became admins, however, they turned into what Anthony calls\n\u201cjanitors\u201d.\n\nOne of the wonderful things about Wikipedia is that literally all of the\ndata \u2014 every single edit and practically every discussion made on or\nabout the site \u2014 is easily available. So there\u2019s an enormous amount more\nto learn about how it gets written. (In addition to nailing down what we\nknow so far a little better.)

My time is too valuable to\nargue with these people\u2026\u2019\n\n[Bill Coderre\ntold](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c29) of how he\nwrote entire articles from scratch, only to see them ruined \u2018by some\nsuper-editors, who removed content, and turned what I thought was\ngosh-darn good writing into crap. \u2026 These people, by and large, \u201cedited\u201d\nthousands of articles. In most cases, these edits were to remove\nmaterial that they found unsuitable. Indeed, some of the people-history\npages contained little \u201cawards\u201d that people gave each other \u2014 for\nremoving content from Wikipedia.\u2019\n\nAnd it seems like half of all the people I meet have a story about being\nlisted for deletion and the nasty insults that ensued. Seriously, there\nhave been numerous times I\u2019ve said something about Wikipedia to a\nrelatively well-known person and they responded back with a story about\nhow someone insulted and deleted them. \u2018[T]here are culture vultures\noverlooking Wkidpedia waiting to kill anything that doesn\u2019t fit the\nnorm\u2019, [wrote\nMediangler](http://www.mediangler.com/2006/09/04/who-writes-wikipedia-but-where-do-you-go-for-this-data-european-web-20-again-chuquet/).\n\nWhy does this matter? Why should we listen to the angry complaints of\nrandom people on the Internet? If occasional contributors are the\nlifeblood of Wikipedia, as the evidence suggests, then alienating such\npeople just can\u2019t be healthy for the project. As Ian wrote, \u2018if we are\nto invest our valuable time contributing some expert knowledge on some\nsubject, we want to know that our work will remain there for others, and\nnot just keep getting reverted out in seconds by some control freak that\nknows nothing about the actual subject. \u2026 your article proves the\nexist[e]nce of this \u201cinner gang\u201d that I feel are actually holding\nWikipedia back. To allow Wikipedia to grow and really pick the brains of\nthe experts around the world, you need to do something to break up this\ninner gang and the mini empires they are building for themselves.\u2019\n\nPerhaps we can improve things with new rules (not only should you [not\nbite the newcomers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BITE), you shouldn\u2019t\neven bark at them) and new software (making it easier to discuss changes\nand defend contributions), but most importantly, it\u2019s going to require a\ncultural shift. Larry Sanger famously suggested that [Wikipedia must\njettison its\nanti-elitism](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25) so\nthat experts could feel more comfortable contributing. I think the real\nsolution is the opposite: Wikipedians must jettison their *elitism* and\nwelcome the newbie masses as genuine contributors to the project, as\npeople to respect, not filter out.\n", "external_links": ["http://reddit.com/info/g9si/comments/cgc62", "mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://reddit.com/info/g9si/comments/cga0i", "http://www.mediangler.com/2006/09/04/who-writes-wikipedia-but-where-do-you-go-for-this-data-european-web-20-again-chuquet/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BITE", "http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25"], "time": 1157439600.0, "postid": "whowritescomments", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c3", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c29", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c17", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c17", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c19", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia#c29"]}, "handwritingwall": {"post_title": "The Handwriting on the Wall", "tags": ["morality"], "post_content": "The Handwriting on the Wall\n===========================\n\nDecember 6, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*I recently attended a talk at Stanford by Walter Bradford Ellis, a\ntoo-little-known activist and writer on the issue of global poverty and\nworld hunger. It\u2019s transcribed from a recording I made. The sound\nquality was lousy, so apologies if I\u2019ve mangled some of the specifics.*\n\nGood evening. This is the first time I\u2019ve spoken before a college\naudience, and therefore I would like to take advantage of your presence\nto ask you a few questions before I begin on my prepared speech.\nBasically I want to know how morally committed the students at a typical\n\u2018good\u2019 school are, and while I know an audience of several hundred from\none school is neither large enough nor diverse enough to give an\nespecially accurate picture, still the results should provide a rough\nindication of where the real truth lies. That\u2019s sort of an interesting\njuxtaposition of words. \u2018Truth lies\u2019 I mean.\n\nAnyway, as I said, I\u2019m interested in knowing how morally committed you\nare. I must say at the outset, I am pessimistic. At any rate, primarily\nwhat I want to find out tonight is how important it is to you for you to\nact according to your own definition of right and wrong. In other words\nI\u2019m not interested in knowing what sort of behavior you think is right\nor wrong but merely how committed you are to living up to whatever\nstandards of right and wrong you possess.\n\nI was trying to think a few minutes ago what questions I could ask you\nto find out this information, and it is very difficult to come up with\nanything satisfactory simply because individual standards of right and\nwrong vary so markedly. I had to pick a situation which seems perhaps a\nlittle silly because it is so improbable, but that is because I wanted\nas pure a case as possible\u2014one which is in no way connected with any\nexisting world situation\u2014so that your prejudices and preconceived\nnotions about a particular situation will play no part in your answers.\n\nMy hypothetical circumstances are concerned with a person who murders\ninnocent people, and I suspect that nearly every one of you will agree\nthat that is wrong. So please now imagine yourself to be in an ancient\ncountry which is ruled over by an evil king who has absolute power of\nlife or death over all his subjects\u2014including yourself. Now this king is\nvery bored, and so for his amusement he picks 10 of his subjects, men,\nwomen, and children, at random as well as an eleventh man who is\nseparate from the rest. Now the king gives the eleventh man a choice: he\nwill either hang the 10 people picked at random and let the eleventh go\nfree, or he will hang the eleventh man and let the other 10 go free. And\nthe eleventh man must decide which it is to be.\n\nNow if death is bad, then on average 10 deaths must be 10 times as bad\nas one. So hopefully nearly all of you will agree that the eleventh man\nshould give up his life in order that the other 10 might live. But that\nis not the question I am asking you. I\u2019m asking whether you would in\nfact make that sacrifice if you were the eleventh man\u2014if you really did\nhave to decide whether you or they would die. And you knew the king\nmeant business because he did this every year and sometimes killed the\n10 people and other times the eleventh depending wholly upon what the\neleventh had decided.\n\nNow I am about to ask you for a show of hands, but of course I realize\nthat few of you know yourselves so well that you can be certain of the\ncorrectness of your answer\u2014especially if your answer is yes. So I will\nsimply ask you to hold up your hand and answer yes if you are any more\nthan 50% certain that you would make that sacrifice. Understand?\n\nAll right, all yes answers, please raise your hands. Let me see, that\nmust be about a third of you. That\u2019s more than I would have guessed.\n\nNow let me ask only those who are reasonably certain\u2014say 95%\ncertain\u2014that they would make the sacrifice to please raise their hands.\n\nYes. That\u2019s more like what I expected. That\u2019s at most a tenth of you. I\nhave a feeling that most of that tenth of you are kidding yourselves,\nbut perhaps human beings aren\u2019t as selfish as I have always thought.\n\nNow just two more quick questions. Same situation except that the king\nsays he will let his 10 hostages go free if you will go to prison for 20\nyears, otherwise he kills them. That\u2019s an easier question to be sure of\nyour answer about than the previous one, so this time answer yes only if\nyou are quite certain\u201495% or better. All right everybody hold up his\nhand if he is at least 95% sure he would go to prison for 20 years in\norder to save 10 people\u2019s lives.\n\nWell that looks like about three-quarters of you. Again I think you have\noverly high opinions of yourselves, or maybe some of you are too\nembarrassed to tell the truth, but I sincerely hope you are correct in\nyour self-assessments.\n\nJust one question more now. The king says he will let his people go if\nyou will agree to give him all the money you have and all the money you\nwill make in the future, except of course enough for you to feed and\nhouse yourself and take care of all the absolute necessities. In other\nwords he\u2019s asking you to be poor, but not so poor that it impairs your\nhealth in any way. Again I\u2019m asking for at least 95% certainty. All in\nthat category please hold up your hands.\n\nWell that\u2019s nearly every one of you! I\u2019m very pleased; I hope you mean\nit. Perhaps in fact you do this time. After all, since you have the\npower to decide whether 10 people die or whether you give up your money,\nif you made the other decision you would be killing 10 people in order\nto make money for yourself, and surely that is murder.\n\nI see some head-shaking\u2014it looks as though a few of you disagree. The\nking has said, kill these 10 people or I\u2019ll take your money. If you kill\nthem, that is murder.\n\nLook at it another way. If you are poor and kill 10 people in order to\nsteal their money, that is surely murder. But morally speaking, that\nsituation is exactly the same as this one. In both situations if the\npeople die, you will be rich; if they live, you will be poor, and it is\nwithin your power to decide which it is to be. In either situation if\nyou decide that they should die in order that you can be rich, you have\nput your happiness, or not actually even that, you have put material\nriches for yourself above 10 people\u2019s lives. That is the moral error you\nhave made and it is exactly the same for both cases. One is as bad as\nthe other and if one is murder so is the other.\n\nAnyway, those are all the questions I wanted to ask you. I didn\u2019t mean\nto spend as much time on them as I did, but at least from my point of\nview it was well worth the time. Thanks for your indulgence, and also\nfor your soul-searching\u2014I guess those weren\u2019t easy questions to answer\nif you answered them honestly. Just be happy it was a make-believe\nsituation and none of you is likely ever to really be forced to make any\nof those rather unpleasant decisions.\n\nAnd now I\u2019ll get on to what is supposed to be my topic: world hunger.\n\nIn 1650 the population of the world was 500 million (500M). Within the\nnext 50 years an absolute minimum of 500M people will starve to death.\nThe UN reports that around 10M people starve to death every year and the\nproblem is only going to get worse as the population increases.\n\nPerhaps that figure of 500M is too large for you to grasp in abstract\nterms. Let me translate it into something more concrete: if those 500M\npeople were all to join hands, then figuring at about 1,000 people per\nmile, they would form a line long enough to stretch to the moon and\nback\u2014with enough left over to reach across the United States 6 times. Or\nif you prefer keeping things more down to earth, they would reach 20\ntimes around the world.\n\nThe US Army\u2019s M-16 machine-gun fires 700 rounds per minute, or about 12\nrounds per second. If you drove a car past the line of people at a\nlittle over 40 miles per hour, you would pass 700 people every minute.\nIf you used poisoned bullets or some such deadly concoction, you might\nbe able to kill 1 person with every shot as you drove past. If you kept\nyour finger on the trigger for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, killing 1\nperson with every shot, it would take you 3 years and 4 months to kill\nthem all.\n\nIt is a rather gruesome picture, and yet all these people\u2014and probably\nmany more\u2014are absolutely doomed to die in the next 25 to 50 years. And\nit won\u2019t be the quick, easy death of a bullet, but the slow, pitiful,\nwasting death of starvation.\n\nThere is one bright spot in all this, however\u2014the legions of the doomed\nwill not really reach quite 20 times around the world. Perhaps they\u2019ll\nreally only reach 12 or 15 times around, for most of them are children\nand their arms are short.\n\nOpposed to these ravaged peoples of the world are the gluttons of\nAmerica. You yourselves are good examples. As future graduates of a good\ncollege, it is surely within the grasp of most of you to be making a\nsalary, after taxes, of \\$50,000 or more within a few years. How much\nmoney is that? Well, you could easily take care of all the true\nnecessities of life for \\$20,000, thus leaving you \\$30,000 for the\nluxuries. In America, anyone can stay healthy spending five dollars a\nday for food. It is not even hard to do. If one really skimps, he can\nstay alive and well for a dollar\u2014for I have done it. If it can be done\nin America for a dollar a day, it can surely be done for that in the\ncountries where people are starving. Thus your \\$30,000 of luxury money\ncould be providing 82 people with a dollar worth of food a day\u2014people\nwho otherwise might starve. Since presumably if your \\$30,000 were\ndonated to UNICEF, they would take care to pick out poorer than average\npeople, I think it not unreasonable to state that \\$30,000 per year over\na period of 40 years is enough to keep healthy 10 people who would\notherwise starve to death\u2014plus a good many more who would otherwise be\nmalnourished.\n\nSo you see, I lied to you a little while ago when I said none of you\nwould ever have to make any of those three unpleasant decisions. You\nwill never have to make the first or the second\u2014the two hardest\nchoices\u2014but you are this moment confronted with the third: for the 10\nwho would otherwise starve are the 10 hostages, you are the eleventh\nman, and hunger is the king. Thus if you decide to go on with the life\nyou were probably planning to lead, you will be letting 10 people die\nrather than give up your flat-screen television and your cocktail\nparties. And that is more than gluttony, it is murder.\n\nGood evening.\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Aaron again. I\u2019d like to make a few remarks about the speech, but\nbefore I do I should admit something. The speech was not given by Walter\nBradford Ellis. Instead, it was written by a too-little-known\nphilosopher named Louis Pascal. He published it in the 1980s under the\nsame subterfuge in the journal* Inquiry *and it was reprinted in Peter\nSinger\u2019s collection* Applied Ethics. *(I have modified it to bring the\nnumbers up to date and shortened it a little to make it more\nblog-sized.) He justifies the subterfuge as necessary to get readers to\nmore seriously engage in the thought experiment. I do think it would be\nwonderful to have this talk given in person, however.

I was the\ndecider, tasked with making the best selection from the options life\npresented. I could play with this friend or that one, go to this college\nor that one, take this job offer or the other one.\n\nEven my problems I dealt with this way. If someone was annoying me, I\u2019d\nchoose to avoid them. If something was bugging me, I\u2019d choose to stop\nthinking about it. I mostly kept my eyes on what was in front of me.\n\nBut recently I\u2019ve started appreciating the virtues of stepping back and\ntrying to see the bigger picture. Instead of just picking the best\noption, I try to invent new ones. Instead of just avoiding the stuff\nthat bugs me, should I start making plans to fix them.\n\nIt\u2019s given me a weird feeling. I feel more in control of my life, more\nable to cope with my problems. I feel like I\u2019m charting my own destiny,\ninstead of following some track. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s a\nfeeling like I\u2019m getting stronger \u2014 not physically, but psychologically.\nIt\u2019s a good feeling. I feel like I\u2019m growing as a person.\n\nSo I started wondering: *Is there more where that came from?* I realized\nI\u2019ve never stopped to ask whether I could get better at life. After all,\nin my day job, I\u2019m constantly looking for ways to learn and grow \u2014\nreading the latest books and articles about the field, talking to other\npeople with similar jobs and hearing what\u2019s worked for them. Why aren\u2019t\nI doing the same thing for life?\n\nIt turns out to be surprisingly hard. Life comes with no instruction\nmanual and the advice parents give is all over the place. TV and the\nnewspapers don\u2019t offer much more than narrow Quick Tips and I never saw\na course in this stuff at school. There are self-help books and\nself-improvement courses, of course, but they seem overly practical:\nthey\u2019re usually less about working through tough problems and more about\nenergizing you to Get Up And Go! And there\u2019s philosophy about The Good\nLife, but it seems to go too far in the other direction: there\u2019s very\nlittle in there for someone to practically apply.\n\nThe blogs are a weird mix. There are the blogs on \u201clife hacks,\u201d which\nare full of gadgets and gizmos that seem to cause more problems than\nthey solve. There are the anti-procrastination blogs, where the author\nhas a constant stream of epiphanies that all seem to amount to \u201cjust put\naway the distractions and get stuff done.\u201d And there are the charlatans,\nwho tell you that all your wildest dreams can come true if you just\nfollow their patented advice.\n\nSo instead of an obvious place to go, I\u2019ve just been finding little bits\nand pieces in all sorts of strange places: psychology experiments,\nbusiness books, philosophy, self-help, math, and my friends. But since\nthere\u2019s no community around it, it\u2019s hard to discuss it with anyone\n(trying to persuade other people to be interested in what you\u2019re\ninterested in is a fool\u2019s game).\n\nSo I figure I\u2019ll just start writing about it here and see if anyone\ncares. Maybe it\u2019ll grow into something, but even if it doesn\u2019t at least\nI\u2019ll clarify my thoughts and hopefully get a few good suggestions for\nfurther reading.\n\nI don\u2019t have a name for what I\u2019m talking about or even a good sense of\nwhat it is. I\u2019m hopeful that will become clearer with practice. But in\nthe meantime, what\u2019s helped you get better at life?\u2013at thinking,\ndeciding, working, thinking. Whether it\u2019s a gadget or technique or book\nor person, I\u2019d love it if you [posted what you\u2019ve found most helpful in\nthe comments](http://talk.aaronsw.com/take-a-step-back).\n\n**Next in this series:** [Believe you can\nchange](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)\n", "external_links": ["http://talk.aaronsw.com/take-a-step-back"], "time": 1345273200.0, "postid": "stepback", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck"]}, "bookwriting1": {"post_title": "Writing a Book: Part One (Ambition)", "tags": [], "post_content": "Writing a Book: Part One (Ambition)\n===================================\n\nJuly 27, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bookwriting1)\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo I\u2019m writing a book. In some sense, this is nothing new. I\u2019ve wanted\nto write a book since I was probably five and since then I must have\nstarted seriously writing drafts of half a dozen, before abandoning\nthem. But this one feels different somehow. I really think I\u2019m going to\nfinish it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say what it\u2019s about publicly yet (hint: it has to do\nwith politics), but it\u2019s ambitious \u2014 perhaps ridiculously so; when I\ntell people at parties about it they look at me as if trying to\ndetermine whether I\u2019ve gone mad. My goals for it are ambitious too: I\nwant it to be popular (how hard is it to be a \u2018national bestseller\u2019?), I\nwant it to be great writing (accurate, nuanced, and hard-to-put-down),\nand I want it to make a difference (get people organized, change\ngovernment policy). Oh, come on. Now *you\u2019re* giving me that look.\n\nI suppose most authors want these things, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they\ntry particularly hard. And in a way that\u2019s understandable: writing 300\ncoherent pages is hard enough \u2014 why add all these additional\nrequirements? But I have high standards for books. (I\u2019m almost always\ndisappointed.) I figure the least I can do is try my best to live up to\nthem myself.\n\nJust as I\u2019ve always wanted to write a book, I\u2019ve always wondered how you\nwrite one. The problem is that the kind of people who would write books\non how they write books are usually pretty dreadful writers and I can\u2019t\nstand their poor writing, let alone their sense of superiority. (This is\nwhy I kept throwing *On Writing Well* against the wall.) But I\u2019ve never\nwritten a book before, so I don\u2019t feel superior, and I\u2019m at least trying\nto be a great writer. So for people in the same boat, I thought I\u2019d\nwrite about what it\u2019s like.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt started with an email. I\u2019d written a blog post on management that had\ngotten some attention, including a link from the famed Jason Kottke.\nApparently the New York literati all read Jason\u2019s blog, because an\neditor at a publishing house followed the link and read my piece and\nthought it might make a decent book. He worked for the business book\nimprint of a major-name publisher and invited me to give him a call and\ndiscuss the idea further.\n\nNormally when I come up with book ideas, I don\u2019t tell more than a couple\npeople about them. I\u2019ve certainly never talked to anyone at a major-name\npublisher before. So getting this email was thrilling. I\u2019d always\nimagined I\u2019d have to pitch my book to publishers someday, but now\npublishers were coming to *me*, and asking for a book! It gave the whole\nthing a seriousness those other book projects lacked.\n\nI told him I was heading to New York soon and he invited me to lunch at\nthe Knickerbocker. It was the kind of place you imagine New York\nbusinesspeople meet for lunch: guys in suits, wood-paneled walls, I\nthink I might have even spotted a cigar.\n\nThe editor was very excited and encouraging, but as we talked I grew\nincreasingly discouraged. I began to remember how much I hate business\nbooks with a passion, how ridiculously dumb and faddish they are. For\nhis part, the editor complained about how the rest of the world didn\u2019t\ntake business books seriously. They sold ten times better than normal\nbooks, he said, but the *New York Times* refuses to list any of them on\ntheir prestigious nonfiction bestseller list (there\u2019s a special section\njust for business bestsellers that\u2019s only published monthly and buried\naway).\n\nFurthermore, the books are apparently sold in the most degrading ways \u2014\nmotivational talks at the Learning Annex were mentioned. I\u2019d always\nimagined myself as more of a *Charlie Rose* guy. I wanted to write a\nbestseller, it was true, but mostly for the respect, not the money. For\nthe people I hang out with, I suspect writing a bestselling business\nbook would bring me only ridicule.\n\nAfterward I met with a prominent book agent that my friend introduced me\nto \u2014 apparently one of the town\u2019s top ten. She was brilliant and\nenthusiastic and full of energy. Spending an hour batting around ideas\nwith her was lots of fun. Her shelves were lined with the famous books\nher authors had published and I began to dream about a future among\nthose names.\n\nBut that was just the intro, for the details she handed me off to an\nassociate, who explained the next step was to turn my idea into a rough\noutline. So I went back to where I was staying and tried to do just\nthat. But I just couldn\u2019t. I went for walks, I pounded my head against\nthe desk, I tried moving words around on the screen, but I couldn\u2019t seem\nto find a way to make the business book idea make sense. The fundamental\nproblem was simple: who would take business advice from a teenager?\n\nAs I was working on it, another idea (we\u2019ll call it the politics book)\nbegan nagging at the back of my head. I tried not to think of it, but it\nwouldn\u2019t go away. The more I told it to bug off, the louder it nagged.\nFinally, I decided I would get the business book out of the way quickly\nand then do the politics one. But as my idea for the business book fell\napart in my hands, the plan for the politics book grew clearer and\nclearer. I began talking about it, getting excited about it, even doing\na whole outline for it. It seemed so perfect, so *right*. Finally, my\ngirlfriend asked why I didn\u2019t just do that book instead.\n\nThe associate agent was tepid (I guess politics books don\u2019t sell as\nwell), but intrigued enough to suggest I pursue it. He said the next\nstep was to work on expanding my description of the introduction. And\nsomehow I got it in my head that the best way to do this would be to\njust try and write it.\n\nWhich meant I needed to figure out how to write.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1248678000.0, "postid": "bookwriting1", "internal_links": []}, "dweck": {"post_title": "Believe you can change", "tags": [], "post_content": "Believe you can change\n======================\n\nAugust 18, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*This post is part two of the series [Raw\nNerve](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).*\n\nCarol Dweck was obsessed with failure. You know how some people just\nseem to succeed at everything they do, while others seem helpless,\ndoomed to a life of constant failure? Dweck noticed that too \u2014 and she\nwas determined to figure out why. So she began watching kids, trying to\nsee if she could spot the difference between the two groups.\n\nIn a 1978 study with Carol Diener, she gave kids various puzzles and\nrecorded what they said as they tried to solve them. Very quickly, the\nhelpless kids started blaming themselves: \u201cI\u2019m getting confused,\u201d one\nsaid; \u201cI never did have a good rememory,\u201d another explained.\n\nBut the puzzles kept coming \u2014 and they kept getting harder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\nfun anymore,\u201d the kids cried. But still, there were more puzzles.\n\nThe kids couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cI give up,\u201d they insisted. They\nstarted talking about other things, trying to take their mind off the\nonslaught of tricky puzzles. \u201cThere is a talent show this weekend, and I\nam going to be Shirley Temple,\u201d one girl said. Dweck just gave them even\nharder puzzles.\n\nNow the kids started getting silly, almost as if they could hide their\nfailure by making it clear they weren\u2019t trying in the first place.\nDespite repeatedly being told it was incorrect, one boy just kept\nchoosing brown as his answer, saying \u201cChocolate cake, chocolate\ncake.\u201d^[1](#fn:dweck78)^\n\nMaybe these results aren\u2019t surprising. If you\u2019ve ever tried to play a\nboard game with kids, you\u2019ve probably seen them say all these things and\nmore (Dweck appears to be missing the part where they pick up the game\nboard and throw all the pieces on the floor, then run away screaming).\n\nBut what shocked her \u2014 and changed the course of her career \u2014 was the\nbehavior of the successful kids. \u201cEveryone has a role model, someone who\npointed the way at a critical moment in their lives,\u201d she later wrote.\n\u201cThese children were my role models. They obviously knew something I\ndidn\u2019t and I was determined to figure it out.\u201d^[2](#fn:mindset1)^\n\nDweck, like many adults, had learned to hide her frustration and anger,\nto politely say \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to play this anymore\u201d instead of\nknocking over the board. She figured the successful kids would be the\nsame \u2014 they\u2019d have tactics for coping with failure instead of getting\nbeaten down by it.\n\nBut what she found was radically different. The successful kids didn\u2019t\njust live with failure, they *loved* it! When the going got tough, they\ndidn\u2019t start blaming themselves; they licked their lips and said \u201cI love\na challenge.\u201d They\u2019d say stuff like \u201cThe harder it gets the harder I\nneed to try.\u201d\n\nInstead of complaining it wasn\u2019t fun when the puzzles got harder, they\u2019d\npsych themselves up, saying \u201cI\u2019ve almost got it now\u201d or \u201cI did it\nbefore, I can do it again.\u201d One kid, upon being a given a really hard\npuzzle, one that was supposed to be obviously impossible to solve, just\nlooked up at the experimenter with a smile and said, \u201cYou know, I was\n*hoping* this would be informative.\u201d^[3](#fn:dweckleggett)^\n\n*What was wrong with them?*\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe difference, Dweck discovered, was one of mindset. Dweck had always\nthought \u201chuman qualities were carved in stone. You were smart or you\nweren\u2019t, and failure meant you weren\u2019t.\u201d That was why the helpless kids\ncouldn\u2019t take it when they started failing. It just reminded them they\nsucked (they easily got confused, they had \u201ca bad rememory\u201d). Of course\nit wasn\u2019t fun anymore \u2014 why would it be fun to get constantly reminded\nyou\u2019re a failure? No wonder they tried to change the subject. Dweck\ncalled this the \u201cfixed mindset\u201d \u2014 the belief that your abilities are\nfixed and that the world is just a series of tests that show you how\ngood you are.\n\nThe successful kids believed precisely the opposite: that everything\ncame through effort and that the world was full of interesting\nchallenges that could help you learn and grow. (Dweck called this the\n\u201cgrowth mindset.\u201d) That\u2019s why they were so thrilled by the harder\npuzzles \u2014 the easier ones weren\u2019t any sort of challenge, there was\nnothing you could learn from them. But the really tough ones? Those were\nfascinating \u2014 a new skill to develop, a new problem to conquer. In later\nexperiments, kids even asked to take puzzles home so they could work on\nthem some more.^[4](#fn:muellerdweck)^\n\nIt took a seventh-grader to explain it to her: \u201cI think intelligence is\nsomething you have to work for\u2026it isn\u2019t just given to you\u2026 Most kids, if\nthey\u2019re not sure of an answer, will not raise their hand\u2026 But what I\nusually do is raise my hand, because if I\u2019m wrong, then my mistake will\nbe corrected. Or I will raise my hand and say\u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t get this. Can\nyou help me?\u2019 Just by doing that I\u2019m increasing my\nintelligence.\u201d^[5](#fn:m2)^\n\nIn the fixed mindset, success comes from proving how great you are.\nEffort is a bad thing \u2014 if you have to try hard and ask questions, you\nobviously can\u2019t be very good. When you find something you *can* do well,\nyou want to do it over and over, to show how good you are at it.\n\nIn the growth mindset, success comes from growing. Effort is what it\u2019s\nall about \u2014 it\u2019s what makes you grow. When you get good at something,\nyou put it aside and look for something harder so that you can keep\ngrowing.\n\nFixed-mindset people feel smart when they don\u2019t make mistakes,\ngrowth-mindset people feel smart when they struggle with something for a\nlong time and then finally figure it out. Fixies try to blame the world\nwhen things go bad, growthers look to see what they can change about\nthemselves. Fixies are afraid to try hard \u2014 because if they fail, it\nmeans they\u2019re a failure. Growthers are afraid of not trying.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs Dweck continued her research, she kept finding this difference in all\nsorts of places. In relationships, growth-mindset people looked for\npartners who would push them to be better, fixies just wanted someone\nwho would put them on a pedestal (and got into terrible fights when they\nhit problems). Growther CEOs keep looking for new products and ways to\nimprove, fixies cut research and tried to squeeze profits from old\nsuccesses. Even in sports, growther athletes got better and better\nthrough constant practice, while fixies blamed their atrophying skills\non everyone around them.\n\nBut Dweck applied a growth mindset to the question of mindset \u2014 and\ndiscovered that your mindset could itself be changed. Even small\ninterventions \u2014 like telling students they were doing well because they\ntried hard, rather than because they were smart \u2014 had huge effects. With\nmore work, she could change totally fixed-mindset people into fervent\ngrowth-mindset ones.\n\nShe herself changed, converting from a fervent fixed-mindsetter, always\nlooking for excuses to prove how smart she was, to a growther, looking\nfor new challenges. It was hard: \u201csince I was taking more risks, I might\nlook back over the day and see all the mistakes and setbacks. And feel\nmiserable. [You feel like a zero]\u2026 you want to rush right out and rack\nup some high numbers.\u201d But she resisted the urge \u2014 and became a leading\npsychologist instead.^[6](#fn:m3)^\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe first step to getting better is believing you *can* get better. In\nher book, *[Mindset](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0345472322)*, Dweck\nexplains how to start talking back to your fixed mindset. The fixed\nmindset says, \u201cWhat if you fail? You\u2019ll be a failure.\u201d The growth\nmindset replies, \u201cMost successful people had failures along the\nway.\u201d^[7](#fn:site)^\n\nNow when I first heard about this work, I just thought: that\u2019s nice, but\nI already do all this. I believe fervently that intelligence can change\nand that talents can be learned. Indeed, I\u2019d say I\u2019m almost\npathologically growth mindset. But even I began to notice there are some\nthings I have a fixed mindset about.\n\nFor example, I used to think I was introverted. Everyone had always told\nme that you were either an extroverted person or an introverted person.\nFrom a young age, I was quite shy and bookish, so it seemed obvious: I\nwas an introvert.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve grown, I\u2019ve found that\u2019s hardly the end of the story. I\u2019ve\nstarted to get good at leading a conversation or cracking people up with\na joke. I *like* telling stories at a party a story or buzzing about a\nroom saying \u2018hi\u2019 to people. I get a rush from it! Sure, I\u2019m still not\nthe most party-oriented person I know, but I no longer think we fit into\nany neat introversion/extroversion buckets.\n\nGrowth mindset has become a kind of safe word for my partner and I.\nWhenever we feel the other person getting defensive or refusing to try\nsomething because \u201cI\u2019m not any good at it\u201d, we say \u201cGrowth mindset!\u201d and\ntry to approach the problem as a chance to grow, rather than a test of\nour abilities. It\u2019s no longer scary, it\u2019s just another project to work\non.\n\nJust like life itself.\n\n**Next in this series:** [Look at yourself\nobjectively](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Ever since the atom bomb and the space race, it\u2019s just been\ntaken for granted that civilization advances through the progress of\nscience. Science\u2014we are told\u2014grows our food, cures our diseases, creates\nour new technologies, and just generally propels the human race forward.\n\nIf science is the engine of progress, then those who have not been\ncaptured under its spell must be dusty relics of prejudice and caprice.\nFields under the sway of hidebound tradition must be bulldozed and\nrenovated in the image of science. Thus doctors, instead of making\ndecisions by random whim, must be forced to practice \u201cevidence-based\nmedicine\u201d where all their prescriptions are backed by randomized\ncontrolled trials. Policymakers, instead of just being bleeding-heart\ndo-gooders, must temper their enthusiasm for regulation by doing\ncost-benefit analyses to see if their proposals make sense. Managers,\ninstead of following their intuition, must subject their strategies to\nrigorous experiment\u2014through A/B tests in the market.\n\nBut what\u2019s weird about this mania for science is how unscientific it all\nis. As far as I know, no studies have shown that evidence-based medicine\nleads to better patient outcomes or that companies which practice\ncomprehensive A/B testing are more profitable than those which follow\ntheir intuition. And the evidence that science is responsible for stuff\nlike increased life expectancy is [surprisingly\nweak](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060975199).\n\nBut there\u2019s such a mania for science that even asking these questions\nseems absurd. How could there possibly be evidence against\nevidence-based medicine? The whole idea seems like a contradiction in\nterms. But it is not.\n\nRecent decades have seen science encroach on the kitchen, with\nscientific approaches to cooking and cuisine. Where other chefs might\nsimply follow instructions they found on a yellowing scrap of paper, the\nnew modernists seek to understand the physics behind their actions. This\napproach has led to some interesting new techniques, but it\u2019s also led\nus to understand that some of those silly traditions aren\u2019t so silly\nafter all.\n\nEggs, for example, were often beaten in copper bowls. Why copper bowls?\nChefs might have been able to give you some kind of reason, but it would\nhave sounded silly to scientific ears. But the modernists discovered\nthat the ions in the copper ended up forming complex bonds with the\nconalbumin in the eggs.\n\nThis was not something that chefs had ever established as scientific\nknowledge\u2014no aproned Isaac Newton ever discovered this was the right way\nto cook the eggs\u2014but it was knowledge chefs had nonetheless. It was, in\nPolyani\u2019s phrase, tacit knowledge, part of the things society genuinely\nknew but was never able to write down or clearly prove.\n\nScientism systematically destroys tacit knowledge. If chefs were forced\nto follow \u201cevidence-based cooking\u201d, not using anything special like a\ncopper bowl until their was a peer-reviewed double-blind randomized\ncontrolled trial proving its effectiveness, the result surely would be\nworse food. So why is it crazy to believe the same attitude leads to\nworse medicine?\n\nIn business, too, scientism could be quite destructive. Can Steve Jobs\nprovide a proof for the rightness of every iPhone feature? Can Doug\nBowman do a scientific experiment to [justify his every shade of\nblue](http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html)?\nForcing them to could well make their work far worse instead of better.\n\nScientism even fails just within our own heads. If you\u2019re struggling\nwith a decision, we\u2019re taught to approach it more \u201cscientifically\u201d, by\nsystematically enumerating pros and cons and trying to weight and\nbalance them. That\u2019s what Richard Feynman would do, right? Well, studies\nhave shown that this sort of explicit approach repeatable leads to\n*worse* decisions than just going with your gut. Why? Presumably for the\nsame reason: your gut is full of tacit knowledge that it\u2019s tough to\narticulate and write down. Just focusing on the stuff you can make\nexplicit means throwing away everything else you know\u2014destroying your\ntacit knowledge.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no guarantee that just trusting your gut will work\neither. Intuition and tradition are often just as wrong as scientific\ncluelessness. And in the cases where they genuinely have little to\ncontribute, throwing them away (or quarantining it until it\u2019s proven by\nscientific test) might not be such a bad idea. But I\u2019ve always just\nassumed that this was *always* true\u2014that tradition and intuition had\nnothing to contribute, unless carefully coached by scientific practice.\nThat science was the only way to get knowledge, rather than just another\nway of codifying it. Now, instead of throwing it all away, I\u2019m now\nthinking I ought to spend more time finding ways to harness all that\ntacit knowledge.\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060975199", "http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html"], "time": 1344582000.0, "postid": "sciencefaith", "internal_links": []}, "squarezooko": {"post_title": "Squaring the Triangle: Secure, Decentralized, Human-Readable Names", "tags": ["identity"], "post_content": "Squaring the Triangle: Secure, Decentralized, Human-Readable Names\n==================================================================\n\nJanuary 6, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen using computers, we like to refer to things with names. For\nexample, this website is known as \u201cwww.aaronsw.com\u201d. You can type that\ninto your browser and read these words. There are three big properties\nwe might want from such names:\n\n-   **secure:** that when you type the name in you actually get my\n    website and not the website of an imposter\n-   **decentralized:** that no central authority controls all the names\n-   **human-readable:** that the name is something you can actually\n    remember instead of some long string of randomness\n\nIn a classic paper, my friend Zooko argued that you can get at most two\nof these properties at any one time.\n\nRecently, DNS legend Dan Kaminsky used this to argue that since\nelectronic cash was pretty much the same as naming, Zooko\u2019s triangle\napplied to it as well. He used this to argue that\n[BitCoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/), the secure, decentralized,\nhuman-meaningful electronic cash system was impossible. I have my\nproblems with BitCoin, but it\u2019s manifestly not impossible, so I just\nassumed Kaminsky had gone wrong somewhere.\n\nBut tonight I realized that you can indeed use BitCoin to square Zooko\u2019s\ntriangle. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nLet there be a document called the scroll. The scroll consists of a\nseries of lines and each line consists of a tuple (name, key, nonce)\nsuch that the first N bits of the hash of the scroll from the beginning\nto the end of a line are all zero. As a result, to add a line to the\nscroll, you need to do enough computation to discover an appropriate\nnonce that causes the bits of the hash to be zero.\n\nTo look up a name, you ask everyone you know for the scroll, trust\nwhichever scroll is the longest, and then start from the beginning and\ntake the key for the first line with the name you\u2019re looking up. To\npublish a name, you find an appropriate nonce and then send the new line\nto everyone you know.\n\nOK, let\u2019s pause there for a second. How do you steal names in such a\nsystem? First, you need to need to calculate a new nonce for the line\nyou want to steal and every subsequent line. Second, you need to get\nyour replacement scroll to the user. The first is difficult, but perhaps\nnot impossible, depending on how many lines ago the name you want to\nsteal is. It requires having some large multiple of the rest of the\nnetwork\u2019s combined CPU power. This seems like a fairly strong constraint\nto me, but apparently not to Dan. Luckily, we\u2019re saved by the second\nquestion.\n\nLet there be a group of machines called the network. Each remembers the\nlast scroll it trusted. When a new valid line is created it\u2019s sent to\neveryone in the network and they add it to their scroll.^[1](#fn:fn1)^\nNow stealing an old name is impossible, since machines in the network\nonly add new names, they don\u2019t accept replacements for old ones.\n\nThat\u2019s fine for machines already in the network, but how do you join?\nWell, as a physical law, to join a network you need the identity of at\nleast one machine already in the network. Now when you join, that\nmachine can give you a fabricated scroll where they\u2019ve stolen all the\nnames. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to avoid this \u2014 if you don\u2019t know\nanyone willing to tell you the correct answer, you can\u2019t will the\ncorrect answer out of thin air. Even a centralized system depends on\nknowing at least one honest root.\n\nYou can ameliorate this problem by knowing several nodes when you\nconnect and asking each of them for their scroll. It seems like the best\ntheoretically-possible case would be requiring only one node to be\nhonest. That would correspond to trusting whichever node had the longest\nscroll. But this would leave you vulnerable to an attacker who a) has\nenough CPU power to fabricate the longest scroll, and b) can co-opt at\nleast one of your initial nodes. The alternative is to trust only\nscrolls you receive from a majority of your list of nodes. This leaves\nyou vulnerable to an attacker who can co-opt a majority of your initial\nnodes. Which tradeoff you pick presumably depends on how much you trust\nyour initial nodes.\n\nPublishing a false scroll is equivalent to fragmenting the namespace and\nstarting a separate network. (We can enforce this by requiring nodes to\nsign each latest scroll and publish their signature to be considered\nmembers-in-good-standing of the network. Any node that attempts to sign\ntwo contradictory scroll is obviously duplicitous and can be\ndiscounted.) So another way of describing scenario (b) is to say that to\njoin a network, you need a list of nodes where at least a majority are\nactually nodes in the network. This doesn\u2019t seem like an overly\nstrenuous requirement.\n\nAnd we\u2019re actually slightly safer than that, since the majority needs a\nfair amount of CPU to stay plausible. If we assume that you hear new\nnames from some out-of-band source, for them to work on the attacker\u2019s\nnetwork, the attacker must have enough CPU to generate lines for each\nname you might use.

That this is a controversial\nstatement shows just how rare genuine child advocates are (compared to,\nsay, environmentalists) in policy debates.\n\nNCLB requires every school administer standardized tests to their\nstudents. If the scores are bad, they get punished. (This makes as much\nsense as beating kids who lose races.) And it only gets worse from\nthere. Making high test scores the ultimate goal of education distorts\neverything along the way, sending schools spiraling own into a\nKafkaesque nightmare of bureaucratic child torture.\n\n[![Book\ncover](image1_kindergartenkafka)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024)\n\nThe story is told in up-close detail in Linda Perlstein\u2019s *Tested*, a\nprofile of Tyler Heights elementary in Maryland. It\u2019s a tale of such\nthoroughgoing rot that it\u2019s hard to even know where to begin. But let\u2019s\nstart with the tests. They\u2019re invasive and traumatic. They take time and\nteachers away from class and scare students (especially since the kids\nare led to believe they won\u2019t graduate if they fail). They test narrow,\nspecific knowledge in dumb ways (\u201cWhat text features made the directions\n[in this cookie recipe] easy for third graders to follow?\u201d). And they\nmake kids feel like failures in situations where teachers are prohibited\nfrom helping.\n\nThe tests are just plain bad. Their questions are invariably annoying\nand sometimes just plain bizarre (\u201cWhich word is made up of two\nwords?\u201d). Of the handful of examples in the book (which are for 3rd\ngraders), even I get some of them wrong. They assume weird background\nknowledge (which two presses are the same? \u201cdon\u2019t press me\u201d, \u201cfull-court\npress\u201d, \u201ctailor press\u201d, \u201cpress agent\u201d, \u201cpressing for an answer\u201d) and\nstrange vocab (crabapples and cattails) and are just terribly written,\nfull of stilted jargon.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning. Since the tests are so all-important,\neverything gets pushed around for them. Art and gym are cancelled\n(although, for contractual reasons, not in the school Perlstein studied)\nsince they\u2019re not tested, as is recess (this despite evidence recess\nimproves test scores!). But even more absurdly, science and social\nstudies are canceled too, since the test questions don\u2019t address them.\n\nThe remaining time is spent teaching to the test. Test language\ninfiltrates everything. The only writing students ever do is sample\nshort-answer sections (\u201cWhat text feature could have been added to help\na reader better understand the information?\u201d, as opposed to writing your\nown story). Even the stories kids read are analyzed only in terms of\npotential test questions.\n\nMuch of class is filled with pure test-prep: no actual education, just\ntest-taking tricks. Some of it is common stuff \u2014 take deep breaths, work\nuntil the time is called, eliminate obviously wrong answers \u2014 but most\nof it is specific to the state\u2019s bizarre test (special rules about how\nto phrase written answers and which words to use for extra points). The\nwalls are filled with the school\u2019s four-point plans for successful\nresponses, e.g. BATS, which stands for \u201cborrow from the question, answer\nthe question, use text supports, stretch formula\u201d.\n\nIt only gets worse from there. Apparently even non-stop test prep\ndoesn\u2019t raise scores enough, so schools are forced to use\n\u201cevidence-based curricula\u201d like \u201cSaxon Math\u201d and \u201cOpen Court Reading\u201d.\nThese are special packages of textbooks and workbooks and scripts for\nthe teachers which prescribe specifically which stories and \u201ctext\nfeatures\u201d should be taught in which order and in which way. (Teachers\ncan\u2019t deviate from the script, of course, because that\u2019s not\n\u201cevidence-based\u201d.) The whole system must be purchased for a small\nfortune from a major textbook company and supervisors occasionally drop\nin to make sure the books are being used appropriately.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the books don\u2019t teach any actual understanding; they\u2019re just\nteaching kids to memorize the answers to various test prep questions.\nWhen asked a question, the students just cycle through random\ncombinations of test buzzwords until they hit upon the right answer.\nSince they never get to read for fun, or even read for anything other\nthan dissecting text features, they presumably learn to hate reading\ntoo.\n\nBut the stilted curricula is just the beginning of the scammers. In\ntheir desperation to raise scores up, schools are open to predation by a\nwhole suite of consultants and teams who promise to have the winning\nsecret to raising test scores. (One of the book\u2019s most poignant scenes\ncomes at an educational conference, when one such scam artist takes\ncredit for the profiled school\u2019s test score rise.) And so the teachers\nare forced to do absurd things like write the state educational\nguidelines they plan to fulfill that day on the board, assign practice\ntests weekly, have their teaching evaluated by non-educators who observe\nthem for fifteen minutes, and hold school assemblies on test prep\nfeaturing men in furry blue muppet costumes.\n\nTogether, it\u2019s a frightening picture: no recess, no science, no social\nstudies, no leaving your chair or working in groups, just sitting in\nyour seat, listening to scripts and test-prep advice, before worrying\nyou\u2019re about fail school because you have no idea what they\u2019re saying.\nThis is what they mean when they say \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEvery year, a couple months before school ends, a kind of controlled\nexperiment happens in NCLB schools: The principal remains the same, the\nteachers remain the same, the students remain the same. The only thing\nthat changes is that the test is over, forgotten until next year starts.\nAnd suddenly everything changes: test prep boards come off the wall,\nstudents start writing poetry, they go on field trips and do science\nexperiments, they work in groups and do real reading.\n\nI challenge anyone to watch both schools and insist that the first is\nbetter for our kids. I don\u2019t think you could do it. So, of course,\nnobody watches. Decisions on these laws are made far away, in DC, by\nfolks whose only experience of public school comes from staged photo\nops.\n\nEveryone loves to critique No Child Left Behind. Democrats say it isn\u2019t\nfully funded, Republicans say it interferes too much with local control\nof schools. But this is just tinkering around the edges \u2014 nobody\ndisagrees with the fundamental premise. After all, what politician can\nbe against accountability?\n\nThe only question left is: who will hold them accountable?\n\n[image1_kindergartenkafka]: image1_kindergartenkafka.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024"], "time": 1226822400.0, "postid": "kindergartenkafka", "internal_links": []}, "howappleworks": {"post_title": "How Apple Works", "tags": ["technology"], "post_content": "How Apple Works\n===============\n\nJuly 22, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/howappleworks)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWho takes over for Steve Jobs?^[1](#fn:f1)^[John Gruber recently\nposted](http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/succeeding_steve_jobs) his\nargument for thinking it will be COO Tim Cook. The biggest point in\nCook\u2019s favor is simple: \u201cHe\u2019s already run the company while Jobs has\nbeen on leave.\u201d That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s less meaningful than it sounds.\nBut to understand why, you need to understand how Apple works.\n\nIn the same way that Google is a company driven by engineering or Amazon\nis driven by operations, Apple is driven by taste. Here\u2019s how Apple\nproducts are created: a team of designers decide exactly what a product\nshould do and how it should look and feel, their work is ruthlessly\nedited by Steve until he approves, and then the entire rest of the\ncompany is given the task of moving mountains to make that dream real.\n\nTim Cook is in charge of that third step. And he\u2019s done a masterful job\nof it, accomplishing endless miracles never been seen by the public.\nApple engineers have invented entirely new chips to fit the specified\nprocessing power into the tiny cases required by the spec; they build\nentirely new factories with entirely new production processes just to\nperfectly match the shade of pink in the original design; they\u2019ve\ncreated a revolution in logistics to ensure these amazing products get\ninto customers\u2019 hands on launch day. Cook runs this process, and there\u2019s\nno doubt he\u2019s brilliant at it.\n\nBut it\u2019s about fulfilling Jobs\u2019 dreams, not forging new ones. He can\ncontinue to run the company while Jobs is away because he\u2019s continuing\nto ensure the execution of designs that Jobs has already approved. But\nApple can\u2019t run indefinitely on old plans. The only reason it works for\nCook to be in charge while Steve is away is because Steve is still\naround, doing ruthless critiques of yet-to-be-invented products from his\nsickbed.\n\nThe only person with the credibility to helm Apple in the long run is a\nperson who can do those critiques. And for all Cook\u2019s brilliance, I\u2019ve\nseen no evidence he\u2019s a master of great taste. His creativity is at\nachieving a predetermined goal, not about deciding what goal to achieve.\n\nAs Gruber says, whoever takes Steve\u2019s place will be someone already at\nApple. Not just because all the other options are absurd, but because\nSteve has spent the past decade or so carefully training his top\nlieutenants about how to do every aspect of his job. It makes no sense\nto hire from outside that elite group. But within that group, there\u2019s\nonly one person who makes any sense as tastemaker-in-chief: Jony Ive.\n\nThis becomes obvious if you just watch the keynotes. Steve Jobs is well\nknown for raising the product keynote to an art form. But the others who\nhave taken over the speaking job in recent years \u2014 Scott Forstall, Phil\nSchiller, Tim Cook \u2014 seem like clumsy kids trying to fill the shoes of\nthe master. There\u2019s only one person at Apple who gives talks with the\nelegance and style of Steve: Jony Ive.\n\nNow the big criticism of Ive is that while he is clearly one of the most\nbrilliant industrial designers in the world, he\u2019s shown no aptitude for\nsoftware design. It\u2019s hard to know whether this is true. The [Mobile\nDesign Awards credited\nIve](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/07/jonathan-ive-takes-home-mda-award-for-iconic-iphone-design.ars)\nwith the iPhone\u2019s user interface, but [the\npatent](http://www.google.com/patents/about/7479949_Touch_screen_device_method_and_g.html?id=dCKzAAAAEBAJ)\ncredits Jobs and Forstall and a dozen others, but not Ive.\n\nBut even if Ive never designed a piece of software in his life, it\u2019d be\nbeside the point. I can\u2019t imagine Jobs has either. What\u2019s needed atop\nApple is not creative brilliance \u2014 they have a design department full of\nthat \u2014 but editorial taste. Like [the director of a\nfilm](http://kottke.org/11/07/a-day-in-the-life-of-john-lasseter),\nApple\u2019s CEO needs to go through the thousands of creative ideas\ndeveloped within Apple and decide which ones should be approved for\nproduction and which ones need to sent back for more work.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to imagine Apple functioning without this role. (Would\nApple splinter and start developing all sorts of random unapproved\nproducts like Google under Eric Schmidt?) It\u2019s impossible to imagine Tim\nCook filling this role. (How can he be tastemaker for the whole company\nif he can\u2019t even pull off a decent keynote?) And it\u2019s impossible to\nimagine this role being anywhere but at the top of the org chart. (It\u2019d\nbe like crediting a film to the producer instead of the director.)\n\nNo, if Apple is to continue, it will be with a tastemaker at the top.\nAnd there are no serious candidates besides Ive.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  This piece was written before Steve stepped down as CEO, but I think\n    it still stands. I mean when Steve really leaves: it seems obvious\n    that even as \u201cChairman of the Board\u201d rather than CEO, he\u2019s still\n    tastemaker-in-chief at Apple.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:f1)\n\n\n", "external_links": ["#fn:f1", "http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/succeeding_steve_jobs", "http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/07/jonathan-ive-takes-home-mda-award-for-iconic-iphone-design.ars", "http://www.google.com/patents/about/7479949_Touch_screen_device_method_and_g.html?id=dCKzAAAAEBAJ", "http://kottke.org/11/07/a-day-in-the-life-of-john-lasseter", "#fnref:f1"], "time": 1311318000.0, "postid": "howappleworks", "internal_links": []}, "godismydm": {"post_title": "God Is My Dungeonmaster", "tags": [], "post_content": "God Is My Dungeonmaster\n====================\n\nFebruary 16, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/godismydm)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[broken image](http://www.cafepress.com/godismydm)\n", "external_links": ["http://www.cafepress.com/godismydm"], "time": 1171612800.0, "postid": "godismydm", "internal_links": []}, "movingon": {"post_title": "Moving On", "tags": [], "post_content": "Moving On\n=========\n\nJune 16, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/movingon)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn November 2006, I moved to San Francisco because I had to: my company\ngot acquired and us moving out was a condition of the agreement. It was\nthe first time I\u2019d ever actually lived in San Francisco, as opposed to\njust visiting, and I quickly realized that although it was a fun place\nto visit, I couldn\u2019t stand living here.\n\nEven after all this time, I can\u2019t really put my finger on what it is I\ndon\u2019t like \u2014 in fact, I suspect it\u2019s probably harder for me now to\nexplain it than it was when I first came here. The first thing that\ncomes to mind is how *loud* the city is. I want a place where I can live\nquietly and focus on my work; but San Francisco is filled with\ndistractions. There are always crews tearing up the street, trains that\nare delayed, buses that have broken down, homeless people begging,\nfriends having parties, and so on. It\u2019s impossible to concentrate and\nwithout my concentration, I feel less like me.\n\nThe other big problem is that San Francisco is fairly shallow. When I go\nto coffee shops or restaurants I can\u2019t avoid people talking about load\nbalancers or databases. The conversations are boring and obsessed with\ntechnical trivia, or worse, business antics. I don\u2019t see people reading\nbooks \u2014 even at the library, all the people are in line for the computer\nterminals or the DVD rack \u2014 and people at parties seem uninterested in\nintellectual conversation.\n\nAnd so I\u2019m moving back to Cambridge, Massachusetts \u2014 Harvard Square in\nparticular, the one place I\u2019ve ever been to that brings a special\ndelight to my eyes, that warms my heart just to see. Surrounded by\nHarvard and MIT and Tufts and BC and BU and on and on it\u2019s a city of\nthinking and of books, of quiet contemplation and peaceful\nconcentration. And it has actual weather, with real snow and seasons and\neverything, not this time-stands-still sun that San Francisco insists\nupon.\n\nI miss Boston; I\u2019m excited to go back.\n\nBut I\u2019m also sad to leave my responsibilities in San Francisco. One of\nwhich I\u2019d particularly like your help with. I\u2019ve been honored and\noverjoyed to help Lawrence Lessig get his [Change\nCongress](http://change-congress.org/) project off the ground. If you\nhaven\u2019t heard, he\u2019s trying to build a national movement to get the\ncorruption out of Congress; to pass public financing of public\nelections, earmark reform, and other pressing concerns.\n\nBut they need a full-time day-to-day tech organizer. Someone who knows\nhow to blog and who the bloggers are and can keep them in touch with the\ncommunity. Someone who knows enough about technology to know the tools\nthat can be built and should be. And someone with enough drive and\ntalent to make sure those things get built. It\u2019s a dreamy job and I hope\nthere\u2019s someone out there who will take it from me.

Geez, you\ndon\u2019t even need to hang around little kids. When you\u2019re out chatting\nwith a bunch of people and you say something that shows you didn\u2019t know\nsomething, you look embarrassed. When you\u2019re playing a video game and\nnot doing well, you try to come up with an excuse. People hate failing,\nso much so that they\u2019re afraid to try.\n\nWhich is a problem, because failing is most of what we do, most of the\ntime. The only way to stretch your abilities is to try to do things a\nlittle bit beyond them, which means you\u2019re going to fail some of the\ntime. Even weirder are the competitive situations. If I\u2019m playing a game\nthat relies solely on practice against someone who\u2019s practiced more than\nme, I\u2019m probably going to lose, no matter how good a person I am. Yet I\nstill feel degraded when I do.\n\nAnyone who wants to build a decent educational environment is going to\nneed to solve this problem. And there seem to be two ways of doing it:\ntry and fix the people so that they don\u2019t feel embarrassed at failing or\ntry to fix the environment so that people don\u2019t fail. Which option to\npick sometimes gets people into philopolitical debates (trying to\nimprove kids self-esteem means they won\u2019t be able to handle the real\nworld! preventing kids from experiencing failure is just childish\ncoddling!), but for now let\u2019s just be concerned with what works.\n\nGetting people to be OK with being wrong seems tough, if only because\neverybody I know has this problem to a greater or lesser degree. There\nare occasional exceptions \u2014 mavericks like Richard Feynman (why do *you*\ncare what other people think?) often seem fearless, although it\u2019s hard\nto gauge how much of that was staged \u2014 but these just seem random, with\nno patterns suggesting *why*.\n\nIt seems quite likely that a lot of the fear is induced by a\ngoal-oriented educational system, obsessed with grades for work (A, B,\nC) and grades for students (1st, 2nd, 3rd). And perhaps the fear of\nbeing wrong you see in older people stems from having been through such\nexperiences in childhood. If this is the case, then simply building a\ndecent non-coercive environment for children will solve the problem, but\nthat seems like too much to hope for.\n\nPerhaps the solution is in, as some suggest, building self-esteem, so\nthat when kids are wrong on one thing, they have other things to fall\nback on. I certainly see this process operating in my own mind: \u201cpff,\nsure they can beat me in *Guitar Hero*, but at least I can go back to\nwriting blog entries\u201d. But self-esteem is like a cushion: it prevents\nthe fall from being too damaging, but it doesn\u2019t prevent the fall.\n\nThe real piece, it would seem, is finding some way to detach a student\u2019s\nactions from their worth. The reason failing hurts is because we think\nit reflects badly on us. I failed, therefore I\u2019m a failure. But if\nthat\u2019s not the case, then there\u2019s nothing to feel hurt about.\n\nDetaching a self from your actions might seem like a silly thing, but\nlots of different pieces of psychology point to it. Richard Layard, in\nhis survey *[Happiness: Lessons from a New\nScience](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0143037013)*, notes that studies\nconsistently find that people who are detached from their surroundings \u2014\nwhether through Buddhist meditation, Christian belief in God, or\ncognitive therapy \u2014 are happier people. \u201cAll feelings of joy and even\nphysical pain are observed to fluctuate, and we see ourselves as like a\nwave of the sea\u2014where the sea is eternal and the wave is just its\npresent form.\u201d (p. 191)\n\nSimilarly Alfie Kohn, who [looks more specifically at the studies about\nchildren](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743487486), finds that it\u2019s\nessential for a child\u2019s mental health that parents communicate that they\nlove their child for who they are, no matter what it is they *do*. This\nconcept can lead to some nasty philosophical debates \u2014 what are people,\nif not collections of things done? \u2014 but the practical implications are\nclear. Children, indeed all people, need unconditional love and support\nto be able to survive in this world. [Attachment parenting\nstudies](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015) find that even infants\nare afraid to explore a room unless their mother is close by to support\nthem, and [the same findings have been found in\nmonkeys](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738202789).\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe flip side is: how do we build educational institutions that\ndiscourage these ways of thinking. Obviously we\u2019ll want to [get rid of\ncompetition](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0395631254) as well as\n[grades](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618001816), but even so, [as we\nsaw with Mission Hill](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/missionhill), kids\nare scared of failure.\n\nWhile I\u2019m loathe to introduce *more* individualism into American\nschools, it seems clear that one solution is to have people do work on\ntheir own. Kids are embarrassed in front of the class, [shy people get\nbullied in small groups](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226503550), so all\nthat really leaves is to do it on your own.\n\nAnd this does seem effective. People seem more likely to ask \u201cstupid\u201d\nquestions if they get to write them down on anonymous cards. When people\n[fail in a video game](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/easywayout), it\nonly makes them want to try again right away so they can finally beat\nit. Apparently when nobody knows you\u2019re getting it wrong, it\u2019s a lot\neasier to handle it. Maybe because you know it can\u2019t affect the way\npeople see you.\n\nSchools can also work to discourage this kind of conditional seeing by\nmaking it completely unimportant. Even Mission Hill, which ensured every\nclassroom was mixed-age, still had a notion of age and clear\nrequirements for graduating. What if school, instead of a bunch of\nactivities you had to march through, was a bunch of activities students\ncould pick and choose from. When people are no longer marching, it\u2019s\nhard to be worried about your place in line.\n\nBut can we take the next step? Can schools not just see their students\nunconditionally, but actually encourage them to see themselves that way?\nClearly we could teach everybody Buddhist meditation or something\n(which, [studies apparently\nshow](http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/65/4/564),\nis effective), but even better would be if there was something in the\nstructure of the school that encouraged this way of thinking.\n\nRemoving deadlines and requirements should help students live more fully\nin the moment.

Actually, \u201cdisapproved of\u201d isn\u2019t really the right word \u2014 it was\nimmoral, illegal, disgusting. People who did it lived in secrecy, under\nthe constant threat of blackmail for their actions.\n\nIn the tumult of the 1960s, various out-groups \u2014 blacks, Chicanos,\nNative Americans \u2014 begun organizing themselves and demanding to be\nrespected and given their due. And men-who-had-sex-with-men decided that\nthey were an out-group \u2014 they were gay \u2014 and they deserved rights too.\n\nIn doing so, they transformed an action (having relationships with\nsomeone of the same gender) into an identity (\u201cbeing gay\u201d). And, using\nthe normal human mechanisms for distinguishing between people in your\nclub and those not in it, they closed ranks. Gay men didn\u2019t have sex\nwith women. Those who did weren\u2019t gay, they were \u201cbi\u201d (which became a\nwhole new identity in itself) \u2014 or probably just lying to themselves.\nAnd straight men had to be on constant guard against being attracted to\nother men \u2014 if they were, it meant that deep down, they were actually\ngay.\n\nThis new gay identity was projected back through history \u2014 famous\nhistorical figures were \u201couted\u201d as gay, because they\u2019d once taken lovers\nof their own gender. They truly were gay underneath, it was said \u2014 it\nwas just a homophobic society that forced them to appear to like the\nopposite sex.\n\nAlong with the identity went an attempt at justification. Being gay\nwasn\u2019t \u201ca choice,\u201d they argued \u2014 it was innate. Some people were just\nborn gay and others weren\u2019t. To a culture that tried to \u201ccorrect\u201d gay\npeople into being straight, they insisted that correction was impossible\n\u2014 they just weren\u2019t wired this way. (They even provided a ridiculous\ngenetic explanation for how a species with a small percentage gay people\nmight evolve.)\n\nThis might have been a good thing to say \u2014 maybe even necessary in such\na homophobic culture \u2014 but in the end it has to be seen as simply wrong.\nHaving sex with other people of your gender isn\u2019t an identity, it\u2019s an\nact. And, like sex in general among consenting adults, people should be\nable to do it if they want to. Having sex with someone shouldn\u2019t require\nan identity crisis. (Nobody sees having-sex-with-white-people as part of\ntheir identity, even if that\u2019s primarily who they\u2019re attracted to.)\n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t be forced to categorize themselves as \u201cgay,\u201d\n\u201cstraight,\u201d or \u201cbi.\u201d People are just people. Maybe you\u2019re mostly\nattracted to men. Maybe you\u2019re mostly attracted to women. Maybe you\u2019re\nattracted to everyone. These are historical claims \u2014 not future\npredictions. If we truly want to expand the scope of human freedom, we\nshould encourage people to date who they want; not just provide more\ncategorical boxes for them to slot themselves into. A man who has mostly\ndated men should be just as welcome to date women as a woman who\u2019s\nmostly dated men.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m not gay. I hook up with people. I enjoy it. Sometimes\nthey\u2019re men, sometimes they\u2019re women.

Last time I mentioned this, a couple people asked how I could\nread so many books. Do I read unusually quickly? Do I spend an unusual\namount of time reading? I did a simple calculation: The average person\nspends 1704 hours a year watching TV. If the average reading rate is 250\nwords per minute and the average book is 180,000 words, then that\u2019s 142\nbooks a year. To my surprise, I wasn\u2019t reading nearly enough books. So\nI\u2019ve taken some steps to read more:\n\n1.  **Block your favorite blogs.** I definitely have the mental habit\n    [noted in this xkcd cartoon](http://xkcd.com/477/): at the first\n    sign of mental difficulty, I tab to a different window and begin\n    typing the URL of a favorite blog. This habit is purely automatic, I\n    do it without even thinking about it. As a result, I spend many,\n    many hours a day reading blogs and following their links.\n\n    To overcome this habit, I added all my favorite blogs to an\n    `/etc/hosts` file that redirects them to a bogus IP. Now when I type\n    their URLs, I get an error message. I did the same with Hulu and\n    other sites I use to watch TV shows; if you have a real television,\n    be sure to get rid of it too. Now I usually try visiting a couple\n    different blogs before my conscious self realizes what\u2019s happening,\n    but this happens soon enough and, over the past couple weeks, I\u2019ve\n    managed to pretty much train myself out of this bad habit.\n\n    Now I either focus on the problem at hand or think enough about it\n    to take a break and go for a walk, eat something, drink some water,\n    read a book, or take a nap.\n\n2.  **Order lots of books at the library.** Most people think the way\n    you read more books is by spending more time reading. But I\u2019ve found\n    that, [like exercise](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/loseweight),\n    this is an effect and not a cause. I spend time reading when I have\n    a great book to read. When I don\u2019t, I feel no urge to read and when\n    I do start reading something, I put it down quickly. But if I\u2019m\n    reading a great book, I spontaneously come up with times and places\n    to read it.\n\n    But figuring out which books are great in advance is hard. People\u2019s\n    experiences about which books they find compelling depend somewhat\n    on their interests and finding accurate critics is problematic. So\n    the best way I\u2019ve found to see whether a book is good is to just\n    start reading it.\n\n    My local library system ([Minuteman](http://www.mln.lib.ma.us/))\n    allows you to request up to 20 books online and then delivers them\n    to the branch library nearest you. So whenever someone makes a book\n    recommendation or I hear about a book that seems interesting, I\n    request it online. Then I go and pick up a stack of books at the\n    library every week or so.\n\n    I begin reading them and finish the ones that are exciting enough to\n    finish and return the ones that are unpromising enough to give up\n    on. Then I return them all and get some more.\n\n    I also find that the due dates and the growing pile of books\n    provides additional impetus to read them. And the habit doesn\u2019t cost\n    me any money this way, so I don\u2019t feel guilty about it. (I\u2019m sure\n    you can come up with reasons I should feel guilty, but the fact\n    remains that I don\u2019t.)\n\n3.  **Alienate everyone close to you.** The biggest consumer of time is\n    undoubtedly other people, in large measure because talking to other\n    people is so fun that you don\u2019t notice time going by. By keeping\n    yourself away from other people (living alone is a good start), you\n    free up an enormous amount of time for reading. I find this is\n    particularly useful in reading books, since books can usually\n    substitute for human company: you can take them with you on the\n    train and to meals and curl up with them at night and so on.\n\n    Getting rid of other hobbies no doubt also helps. (And, unlike\n    people, books don\u2019t encourage you to have other hobbies.) I didn\u2019t\n    have any other hobbies, so this was less of a problem for me, but\n    you may want to think about the things you do instead of reading\n    books and stop doing them.\n\n4.  **Keep the temperature low.** A common problem is falling asleep\n    while reading. But I find it\u2019s difficult to fall asleep when I\u2019m\n    cold (whereas it\u2019s very easy to sleep when I\u2019m warm), so I keep the\n    temperature quite low in my apartment during the day. Even when I\u2019m\n    snuggled up in bed, I\u2019m usually cold enough that I can\u2019t fall\n    asleep.\n\nI suspect few people will take all of this advice, but hopefully some of\nit is useful to you.\n", "external_links": ["http://xkcd.com/477/", "http://www.mln.lib.ma.us/"], "time": 1267516800.0, "postid": "morebooks", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/loseweight"]}, "bubblecity7": {"post_title": "Bubble City: Chapter 7", "tags": [], "post_content": "Bubble City: Chapter 7\n======================\n\nNovember 15, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity7)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOn his way into the office, Trent saw a pretty young girl and decided to\nuse it as an opportunity to improve his marketing skills. \u201cHello there,\u201d\nhe shouted at a small and slender woman wearing a huge black coat.

Source-country control \u2014 military programs to destroy drug\nproduction in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia \u2014 are not just\ndevastating to poor third-world citizens; they\u2019re also the least\neffective, costing \\$783 million for a 1% reduction. Interdiction \u2014\nseizing the drugs at the border \u2014 is a much better deal, costing only\n\\$366 million. Domestic law enforcement \u2014 arresting drug dealers and\nsuch \u2014 is even better, at \\$246 million. But all of those are blown\ncompletely out of the water by the final option: funding treatment\nprograms for drug addicts would reduce drug use by 1% at a cost of only\n\\$34 million.\n\nIn other words, for every dollar spent on trying to stop drugs through\nsource-country control, we could get the equivalent of twenty dollars\nbenefit by spending the same money on treatment.

(If there\u2019s one thing pundits love to do, it\u2019s\nhand-wringing.) Without major papers giving everyone an objective view\nof the facts, they insist, the very foundation of the republic is in\nperil.\n\nYou can criticize this view for just being silly or wrong, and many\nhave, but there\u2019s another problem with it: it\u2019s completely ahistorical.\nAs Robert McChesney describes in *The Problem of the Media*, objectivity\nis a fairly recent invention \u2014 the republic was actually founded on\npartisan squabblers.\n\nWhen our country was founded, newspapers were not neutral, non-partisan\noutlets, but the products of particular political parties. The Whigs had\ntheir paper, the Tories theirs, and both of which attacked their\npolitical opponents with slurs that would make even the most\nfoul-mouthed bloggers blush. This behavior wasn\u2019t just permitted \u2014 it\nwas encouraged.\n\nYou often hear the media quote Jefferson\u2019s comment that \u201cwere it left to\nme to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or\nnewspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer\nthe latter.\u201d However, they hesitate to print the following sentence:\n\u201cBut I should mean that every man should receive those papers, and be\ncapable of reading them.\u201d In particular, Jefferson was referring to the\npost office subsidy the government provided to the partisan press.\n\nIn 1794, newspapers made up 70% of post office traffic and the big\ndebate in Congress was not over whether the government should pay for\ntheir delivery, but how much of it to pay for. James Madison attacked\nthe idea that newspaper publishers should have to pay even a token fee\nto get the government to deliver their publications, calling it \u201can\ninsidious forerunner of something worse.\u201d By 1832, newspaper traffic had\nrisen to make up 90% of all mail.\n\nIndeed, objectivity wasn\u2019t even invented until the 1900s. Before that,\nMcChesney comments, \u201csuch notions for the press would have been\nnonsensical, even unthinkable.\u201d Everyone assumed that the best system of\nnews was one where everyone could say their piece at very little cost.\n(The analogy to blogging isn\u2019t much of a stretch, now is it? See, James\nMadison loved blogs!)\n\nBut as wealth began to concentrate in the Gilded Age and the commercial\npresses began to lobby government for more favorable policies, the size\nand power of the smaller presses began to dwindle. The commercial\npresses were eager to be the only game in town, but they realized that\nif they were, their blatant partisanship would have to go. (Nobody would\nstand for a one-newspaper town if the one paper was blatantly biased.)\nSo they decided to insist that journalism was a profession like any\nother, that reporting was an apolitical job, based solely on objective\nstandards.\n\nThey set up schools of journalism to train reporters in the new notion.\nIn 1900, there were no J-schools; by 1920, the major ones were going\nstrong. The \u201cchurch and state\u201d separation of advertising and reporting\nbecame official doctrine and the American Society of Newspaper Editors\n(ASNE) was set up to enforce it.\n\nThe entire foundation of press criticism was rebuilt. Now, instead of\ncriticizing papers for the bias of their owners, press critics had to\nfocus on the professional obligations of their writers. Bias wasn\u2019t\nabout the slant of a paper\u2019s focus, but about any slanting put in by a\nreporter.\n\nSo that was the line of attack the house press critics took when the\nworld of weblogs brought back the vibrant political debates of our\ncountry\u2019s founding. \u201cThese guys are biased! Irresponsible! They get\ntheir facts wrong! They\u2019re unprofessional!\u201d they squeal.

It\nseems likely you would have killed native Americans. After all, your\nparents killed them, your siblings killed them, your friends killed\nthem, the leaders of the community killed them, the President killed\nthem. Chances are, you would have killed them too, and you probably\nwouldn\u2019t have seen anything wrong with this.\n\nIndeed, it probably wouldn\u2019t even have occurred to you to think about\nthe morality of this. If you did, it would probably seem just. They were\ntrying to kill *you*! And your family! Going after them was just\nself-defense! (It wasn\u2019t, of course; you invaded *their* land.)\n\nOr if you see nothing wrong with killing native Americans, take the\nexample of slavery. Again, everyone had slaves and probably didn\u2019t think\ntoo much about the morality of it. That was just the way the world was.\nIf you were asked about the big moral questions you faced, you\u2019d\nprobably think of things like the proper time to pay back a loan, or\nlying to your wife, or maybe a child\u2019s duty of obedience to their\nfather.\n\nToday, looking back on people who murder native American and keep\nslaves, those seem like comparatively small potatoes. Sure, we justify\nit by saying that they were just people of their time, but still\u2026 It\u2019s\nhard to get over the fact that George Washington ordered his general to\n\u201clay waste all the settlements around\u2026that the country may not be merely\noverrun, but destroyed.\u201d (He also ordered that they not \u201clisten to any\noverture of peace before the total ruin of their settlements is\neffected. Our future security will be in\u2026the terror with which the\nseverity of the chastisement they receive will inspire them.\u201d) It\nsomehow colors everything he says. Whatever he may have thought about\nloan repayment or lying, slavery was the big moral question of his time,\nand (in practice, at least) he got it wrong.\n\nWe don\u2019t kill native Americans much these days and we don\u2019t keep slaves,\nbut it\u2019s hard to believe that our era must be morally perfect. Surely if\npeople back then could make such huge moral blunders, we could be making\nsimilar ones right now. And ethical philosophy is useless if it can\u2019t\nhelp us avoid such huge mistakes.\n\nSome people suggest that the way to do ethical philosophy is to listen\nto our intuitions. \u201cI do not think our intuitions about cases are less\nreliable than those about principles,\u201d Frances Kamm argues.\n\nBut *of course* our intuitions about cases are less reliable! If we\ncould simply trust our intuitions, we wouldn\u2019t need ethical philosophy\nat all. If something was wrong, we would just know it was wrong. There\nwould be nothing philosophy could tell us.\n\nObviously this is absurd. Lots of people do things that seem clearly\nunethical while thinking they\u2019re in the right. Perhaps Kamm thinks these\nmistakes are merely the result of temporary passions and that from her\ndesk at Harvard she can consider such question with a more objective\neye.\n\nBut, as I have shown, people\u2019s intuitions about cases are\n*systematically* distorted. Sitting at a desk wasn\u2019t enough to persuade\nGeorge Washington to stop killing native Americans. His mistake wasn\u2019t\nthe result of some momentary passion, but of an entire culture that had\nnormalized mass murder and a society that depended on it. To think that\nhe would just suddenly sit down and go \u201cHmm, murdering Indians feels\nwrong to me\u201d is ridiculous. The only way he would possibly conclude that\nis by taking seriously his *principles*.\n\nI grew up eating animals. I saw nothing wrong with this. My parents ate\nthem, my siblings ate them, my friends ate them, people on TV ate them,\nthe President ate them. I doubt I stopped to think about the morality of\neating animals any more than I stopped to think about the morality of\nbrushing my teeth. If you asked me for my intuition, I would have said\neating animals was just fine. It was only when I stopped eating animals\nthat my intuitions began to change.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1262160000.0, "postid": "ethicsfor", "internal_links": []}, "everythinggood": {"post_title": "Everything Good is Bad For You", "tags": [], "post_content": "Everything Good is Bad For You\n==============================\n\nMarch 29, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/everythinggood)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile we were developing Reddit, we always used to run into people who\u2019d\nrecognize us and come up to say hi. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d they\u2019d say to us. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t tell you how much your site has killed my productivity.

But after a while, I begun to find them increasingly disturbing.\nWe\u2019d set out to make something people want \u2014 but what if they didn\u2019t\nwant to want it?\n\nFor too long, simple popularity has been the only metric of a startup\u2019s\nsuccess. Another startup, known as Twitter, has recently broken into the\nmainstream. And I constantly hear people saying things like \u201cYeah, well,\nI know it seems like a pointless waste of time. But it\u2019s so *popular*!\u201d\nAs if anything so popular had to be worthwhile.\n\nCory Doctorow recently [made a similar\nargument](http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/03/cory-doctorow-you-do-like-reading-off.html).\nWhen he publishes his books online, he notes, people are always telling\nhim they don\u2019t like reading off a screen. And yet, these very same\npeople spend every free hour of the day reading email and weblogs and\nnews articles off a screen. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching someone shovel Mars Bars\ninto his gob while telling you how much he hates chocolate,\u201d Doctorow\ncomplains. Doctorow\u2019s conclusion? Blogs are just better.\n\nBut I think Mars Bars are just the right analogy. Everyone in America\nknows that it\u2019s easy to accidentally find yourself stuffing your face\nwith junk food when you\u2019re not paying attention. But no one would\nseriously maintain that junk food is better than fine cuisine. It\u2019s just\n*easier*.\n\nSimilarly, if you printed out all the blog posts and news articles and\nemails the average timewaster reads in a month and placed the resulting\nhulking volume down next to a copy of, say, *War and Peace* (which it\nwould no doubt dwarf), it\u2019s hard to imagine the average person saying\nthey\u2019d actually prefer to sit down and read the first. (If *War and\nPeace* doesn\u2019t strike your fancy, substitute a similarly large tome.)\nBut reading bite-sized blog posts is by far *easier*.\n\nThe same goes for reading stories on Reddit or your friends\u2019 pointless\ntwits about their life. Looking at photos of sunsets or reading\none-liners takes no cognitive effort. It\u2019s the mental equivalent of\nsnack food. You start eating one and before you know it you\u2019ve gone\nthrough two cans of Pringles and become a world expert on Evan Williams\u2019\ntravel habits.\n\nWe need to stop pretending that this is automatically a good thing.\nPerhaps Procter & Gamble doesn\u2019t care of their making us into a nation\nof fat slobs, but there\u2019s no reason why programmers and the rest of the\nstartup world need to be so amoral. And no doubt, as pictures of cats\nwith poor spelling on them become all the rage, people are beginning to\nwonder about where all this idiocy is leaving us. Which is where\napologists like Doctorow and Steven Johnson step in, assuring us that\nEverything Bad is Good For You.\n\nIt isn\u2019t. YouTube isn\u2019t going to save us from an *Idiocracy*-style\nfuture in which everyone sits at home and watches shows like \u201cOw! My\nBalls!\u201d (in which a man is repeatedly hit in the balls) \u2014 YouTube\u2019s\ndamn-near creating that future. As I write this, YouTube\u2019s \\#1 featured\nvideo is titled \u201cFarting in Public\u201d.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way, of course. Nobody prefers farting to\nthought. It\u2019s just that, as David Foster Wallace noted about television,\n\u201cpeople tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and\ndumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and\nnoble interests.\u201d Similarly, no one (Doctorow included, I suspect),\nactually prefers blog posts to novels, it\u2019s just that people tend to\nhave more short chunks of time to read blog posts than they do long\nchunks of time to read novels.\n\nTechnology was supposed to let us solve these problems. But technology\nnever solves things by itself. At bottom, it requires people to sit down\nand build tools that solve them.

Their first task was to see whether experts really were expert \u2014\nwhether they were particularly good at their jobs.\n\nWhat they found was that some were and some weren\u2019t. Champion chess\nplayers, obviously, are much better at playing chess than you and I. But\npolitical pundits, it turns out, aren\u2019t that much better at making\npredictions than a random guy off the street.\n\nWhat distinguishes people who are great at what they do from those who\nare just mediocre? The answer, it seems, is feedback. If you lose a\nchess game, it\u2019s pretty obvious you lost. You know right away, you feel\nbad, and you start thinking about what you did wrong and how you can\nimprove.\n\nMaking a bad prediction isn\u2019t like that. First, it\u2019s months or years\nbefore your prediction is [proven wrong](http://wrongtomorrow.com/). And\nthen, you make yourself feel better by coming up with some explanation\nfor why you were wrong: *well, nobody expected that to happen; it threw\neverything else off!* And so you keep on making predictions in the same\nway \u2014 which means you never get good at it.\n\nThe difference between chess and predictions is a lot like the\ndifference between companies and nonprofits. If your company is losing\nmoney, it\u2019s pretty obvious. You know right away, you feel bad, and you\nstart thinking about how to fix it. (And if you don\u2019t fix it, you go\nbankrupt.) But if your nonprofit isn\u2019t accomplishing its goals, it\u2019s\nmuch less obvious. You can point to various measurable signs of success\n(look at all the members we have, look at all the articles we\u2019ve been\nquoted in) and come up with all sorts of explanations for why it\u2019s not\nyour fault.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that we should have companies replace nonprofits, any\nmore than we should have chess games replace predictions. The two serve\ncompletely different goals \u2014 nonprofits aim at improving the world, not\nmaking money. But it does mean that if you\u2019re involved in nonprofits (or\npredictions), you need to be much more careful about making sure you\u2019re\ndoing a good job.\n\nUnfortunately, few nonprofits do that. Take, for example, the Center for\nAmerican Progress, widely believed to be one of the most effective\npolitical nonprofits. They say their goal is \u201cimproving the lives of\nAmericans through ideas and action.\u201d But their \u201cmarketing brochure,\u201d\nwhile filled with glossy photos, doesn\u2019t even attempt to see whether\nthey\u2019re accomplishing this goal. It touts that they\u2019ve released \u201can\neconomic strategy for the next administration,\u201d \u201cconvened a task force \u2026\nto develop policy,\u201d and \u201cdeveloped a plan for the bulk transfer auction\nof at-risk mortgages.\u201d There\u2019s not a single attempt to demonstrate that\nany of these things has approved the lives of Americans, let alone\nestimate how much.\n\nMeasuring things is hard and expensive, even in the simplest cases.\nMeasuring the effect of loaning money to Africans seems a lot easier\nthan measuring the impact of of a think tank report. But when Peter\nSinger asked Oxfam to measure the effectiveness of giving microcredit to\nvillages in West Africa, they declined, on the grounds that it would\nhave taken up half the budget.\n\nBut not measuring is even more expensive. Imagine that Oxfam\nexperimented with two microcredit programs and found that one did 10%\nbetter than the other. Even with this very modest improvement, it would\nonly take helping five villages before the experiment paid for itself.\n\nAnd, as anyone who\u2019s done these sorts of experiments knows, you often\nsee improvements well in excess of 10%. To take a silly example, [Dustin\nCurtis\nexperimented](http://dustincurtis.com/you_should_follow_me_on_twitter.html)\nwith getting more readers of his weblog to follow him on Twitter. After\nfour experiments, he\u2019d achieved a 173% improvement. And even this is\nprobably underestimating things. I expect many nonprofits are not\naccomplishing their goals *at all*. Even if they made a little bit of\nprogress, their improvement would be mathematically infinite. (It\u2019s also\nquite possible that many nonprofits are actually being\n*counter*-productive. After all, before we started measuring the effects\nof medical treatment, we were bleeding people with leeches.)\n\nWhat can be done about this? I think that everyone who donates to a\nnonprofit should demand an accounting of results \u2014 not just the number\nof times they\u2019ve been cited in the media or the number of policy\ndiscussions they\u2019ve held, but an actual attempt to measure how much\nthey\u2019re improving people\u2019s lives. For most nonprofits, I expect these\nnumbers will be depressingly small. But that\u2019s much better than having\nno numbers at all.

After getting\nhimself ashore, he dropped himself into their culture and begun having\nto learn their language and understand their customs. The result were a\nseries of groundbreaking books in the field of anthropology, much of\nwhich is still entertaining to read today.\n\nIn *The Sexual Life of Savages* (savages, Malinowski assures us, is a\ntechnical term and not meant to cause offense) he describes the customs\nof Trobriand\u2019s intimate life, which is fascinating both for how it is\ndifferent and how it is the same.\n\nTo a certain degree, it seems like the culture of the islanders presages\nour own. Back when Malinowski was doing his field work, he was amazed\nthat islanders could freely have premarital sex and yet still found it\ndesirable to get married. The same question would prove no puzzle to any\nAmerican today.\n\nAnd, indeed, the islanders seem like a case study in the ultimate\nconsequences of the sexual revolution: girls want sex just as much as\nguys, kids start having sex at a very young age \u2014 6-8 for the girls and\n10-12 for the guys \u2014 with no social stigma, there are few customs about\ndating to inhibit \u201chooking up\u201d, and, of course, revealing clothing has\nbeen taken to its limit, with girls actually going topless.\n\nOf course, much of the story of a Trobriand\u2019s intimate life is the same:\ninitial attractions budding into lasting relationships, etc. And then,\nout of nowhere, Malinowski drops in something totally bizarre. The\nislanders don\u2019t kiss, he explains. Instead, they scratch. The girls\nscratch the guys so hard that they draw blood and, if the guys can\nwithstand the pain, then they move forward to having sex. The\nethnographer (as Malinowski calls himself) verified this by noting that\njust about everyone on the island had noticeable scratches. And while\neverybody is having sex whenever they want, premarital meal-sharing is a\nbig no-no. You\u2019re not supposed to go out for dinner together until after\nyou get married.\n\nBut the most fascinating and strange part about the islanders are their\nbeliefs on the subject of pregnancy, also described in Malinowski\u2019s\nclassic article \u201c[Baloma: The Spirits of the Dead in the Trobriand\nIslands](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/static/baloma.pdf)\u201d. When people\ndie, you see, their spirit takes a canoe to the island of Tuma, which\nworks very much like the normal island except everybody is a spirit of\nthe dead. When the spirit gets old and wrinkled it shrugs off its skin\nand turns back into an embryo, which a spirit then takes back to the\nisland and inserts into a woman. This, you see, is how women get\npregnant.\n\nThat\u2019s right. The islanders do not believe that sex causes pregnancy.\nThey don\u2019t believe in physiological fatherhood. Malinowski was\nincredibly skeptical about this, so he tried all sorts of ways to see if\nthis was simply a story they told, while they actually the real deal.\nBut no, they assured him that it was really true, that all the white\npeople who insisted otherwise were being silly, that the spirits caused\npregnancy, not sex.\n\nThey argued the case quite logically. After all, they noted, one fellow\nwent on an expedition for a year or two and when he came back, he had a\nnew son. He obviously wasn\u2019t having sex with her while he was away, so\nwhere did the kid come from? (Cough.) And, they note, there are some\nreally hideous people on the island who nobody would dare have sex with,\nyet they manage to become pregnant. (Malinowski spies some kids looking\nsheepish when this subject is raised.)\n\nThey also argue the other way: people on the island are having sex all\nthe time from a very early age and yet they very rarely get pregnant.\n(Naturally, the islanders don\u2019t practice any form of contraception; the\nvery idea doesn\u2019t make sense when sex doesn\u2019t cause pregnancy.) The\nwhite man\u2019s argument just doesn\u2019t make sense. Indeed, [recent visitors\nreport](http://www.travelintelligence.net/wsd/articles/art4print_520.html),\nthe islanders *still* believe that sex doesn\u2019t cause pregnancy, despite\nthe best efforts of health workers.\n\nIt is speculated that the yams that form the basis of the island diet\nhave a contraceptive agent in them (The Pill was originally made by\nlooking at chemicals in wild yams), which conveniently explains quite a\nbit, including the low birthrate despite the high level of sexual\nactivity. Indeed, the whole idea lends quite a bit of support to the\nidea that material factors shape culture \u2014 after all, our own sexual\nrevolution didn\u2019t happen until we got the yam\u2019s chemicals in pill form\nin 1960.\n\nThe notion has some other interesting consequences. For example, the\nsociety is necessarily matrilineal, since fathers have no technical\nlineage. Yet sociological fathers (the mother\u2019s husband), Malinowski\nnotes, show more love and care for their children than most he\u2019s seen in\nEurope.\n\nFurthermore, they believe the same rules apply to the rest of the animal\nkingdom. This is what clinches it for Malinowski \u2014 despite all the\neffort they go to to raise pigs, they insist that pigs also reproduce\nasexually. They never attempt to breed pigs; indeed, they castrate all\nthe male pigs they have. (To them this is further proof \u2014 we castrated\nall the pigs and yet they keep having children! Malinowski notes that\nthe domestic pigs often sneak off to canoodle with those in the wild.)\n\nWhen I told a friend of mine about this odd state of affairs, he\nwondered if the islanders were just stupid. After all, he noted, sex and\nchildbirth aren\u2019t exactly two physically unconnected human activities.\nBut as he reflected on it further, he considered that this belief wasn\u2019t\nthat much different from what passes for religion in our country. Smart\npeople believe strange things.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.travelintelligence.net/wsd/articles/art4print_520.html"], "time": 1160982000.0, "postid": "savagesex", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/static/baloma.pdf"]}, "dsouza": {"post_title": "The Enemy Too Close to Home", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Enemy Too Close to Home\n===========================\n\nFebruary 8, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dsouza)\n\n* * * * *\n\nHow bizarre a book is *The Enemy At Home*, Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s new screed\ninsisting the left is responsible for Islamic extremism?

Such comments imply that time is\n\u201cfungible\u201d \u2014 that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent\nwriting a novel. And sadly, that\u2019s just not the case.\n\nTime has various levels of quality. If I\u2019m walking to the subway station\nand I\u2019ve forgotten my notebook, then it\u2019s pretty hard for me to write\nmore than a couple paragraphs. And it\u2019s tough to focus when you keep\ngetting interrupted. There\u2019s also a mental component: sometimes I feel\nhappy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I\nfeel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.\n\nIf you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact\nand deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time.\nAnd second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.\n\nSpend time efficiently\n----------------------\n\n### Choose good problems\n\nLife is short (or so I\u2019m told) so why waste it doing something dumb?\nIt\u2019s easy to start working on something because it\u2019s convenient, but you\nshould always be questioning yourself about it. Is there something more\nimportant you can work on? Why don\u2019t you do that instead? Such questions\nare hard to face up to (eventually, if you follow this rule, you\u2019ll have\nto ask yourself why you\u2019re not working on the most important problem in\nthe world) but each little step makes you more productive.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that all your time should be spent on the most\nimportant problem in the world. Mine certainly isn\u2019t (after all, I\u2019m\nwriting this essay). But it\u2019s definitely the standard against which I\nmeasure my life.\n\n### Have a bunch of them\n\nAnother common myth is that you\u2019ll get more done if you pick one problem\nand focus on it exclusively. I find this is hardly ever true. Just this\nmoment for example, I\u2019m trying to fix my posture, exercise some muscles,\ndrink some fluids, clean off my desk, IM with my brother, and write this\nessay. Over the course the day, I\u2019ve worked on this essay, read a book,\nhad some food, answered some email, chatted with friends, done some\nshopping, worked on a couple other essays, backed up my hard drive, and\norganized my book list. In the past week I\u2019ve worked on several\ndifferent software projects, read several different books, studied a\ncouple different programming languages, moved some of my stuff, and so\non.\n\nHaving a lot of different projects gives you work for different\nqualities of time. Plus, you\u2019ll have other things to work on if you get\nstuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).\n\nIt also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things\nyou learn in other fields to the field you work in. If you have a bunch\nof different projects going in different fields, then you have many more\nideas you can apply.\n\n### Make a list\n\nComing up with a bunch of different things to work on shouldn\u2019t be hard\n\u2014 most people have tons of stuff they want to get done. But if you try\nto keep it all in your head it quickly gets overwhelming. The psychic\npressure of having to remember all of it can make you crazy. The\nsolution is again simple: write it down.\n\nOnce you have a list of all the things you want to do, you can organize\nit by kind. For example, my list is programming, writing, thinking,\nerrands, reading, listening, and watching (in that order).\n\nMost major projects involve a bunch of these different tasks. Writing\nthis, for example, involves reading about other procrastination systems,\nthinking up new sections of the article, cleaning up sentences, emailing\npeople with questions, and so on, all in addition to the actual work of\nwriting the text. Each task can go under the appropriate section, so\nthat you can do it when you have the right kind of time.\n\n#### Integrate the list with your life\n\nOnce you have this list, the problem becomes remembering to look at it.\nAnd the best way to remember to look at it is to make looking at it what\nyou would do anyway. For example, I keep a stack of books on my desk,\nwith the ones I\u2019m currently reading on top. When I need a book to read,\nI just grab the top one off the stack.\n\nI do the same thing with TV/movies. Whenever I hear about a movie I\nshould watch, I put it in a special folder on my computer. Now whenever\nI feel like watching TV, I just open up that folder.\n\nI\u2019ve also thought about some more intrusive ways of doing this. For\nexample, a web page that pops up with a list of articles in my \u201cto read\u201d\nfolder whenever I try to check some weblogs. Or maybe even a window that\npops up with work suggestions occasionally for me to see when I\u2019m\ngoofing off.\n\nMake your time higher quality\n-----------------------------\n\nMaking the best use of the time you have can only get you so far. The\nmuch more important problem is making more higher quality time for\nyourself. Most people\u2019s time is eaten up by things like school and work.\nObviously if you attend one of these, you should stop. But what else can\nyou do?\n\n### Ease physical constraints\n\n#### Carry pen and paper\n\nPretty much everyone interesting I know has some sort of pocket notebook\nthey carry at all times. Pen and paper is immediately useful in all\nkinds of circumstances \u2014 if you need to write something down for\nsomebody, take notes on something, scratch down an idea, and so on. I\u2019ve\neven written whole articles in the subway.^[1](#fn:sub)^\n\n(I used to do this, but now I just carry my computerphone everywhere. It\ndoesn\u2019t let me give people information physically, but it makes up for\nit by giving me something to read all the time (email) and pushing my\nnotes straight into my email inbox, where I\u2019m forced to deal with them\nright away.)\n\n#### Avoid being interrupted\n\nFor tasks that require serious focus, you should avoid getting\ninterrupted. One simple way is to go somewhere interrupters can\u2019t find\nyou. Another is to set up an agreement with the people around you:\n\u201cdon\u2019t bother me when the door is closed\u201d or \u201cIM me if I have headphones\non\u201d (and then you can ignore the IMs until you\u2019re free).\n\nYou don\u2019t want to overdo it. Sometimes if you\u2019re really wasting time you\n*should* be distracted. It\u2019s a much better use of time to help someone\nelse with their problem than it is to sit and read the news. That\u2019s why\nsetting up specific agreements is a good idea: you *can* be interrupted\nwhen you\u2019re not really focusing.\n\n### Ease mental constraints\n\n#### Eat, sleep, exercise\n\nTime when you\u2019re hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time.\nImproving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise. Yet I somehow manage\nto screw up even this. I don\u2019t like going to get food, so I\u2019ll often\nwork right through being hungry and end up so tired out that I can\u2019t\nbring myself to go get food.^[2](#fn:t)^\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to say to yourself, \u201cI know I\u2019m tired but I can\u2019t take a\nnap \u2014 I have work to do\u201d. In fact, you\u2019ll be much more productive if you\ndo take that nap, since you\u2019ll improve the quality of the day\u2019s\nremaining time and you were going to have to sleep sometime anyway.\n\nI don\u2019t really exercise much so I\u2019m probably not the best person to give\nadvice on that bit, but I do try to work it in where I can. While I\u2019m\nlying down reading, I do situps. And when I need to go somewhere on\nfoot, I run.\n\n#### Talk to cheerful people\n\nEasing mental constraints is much harder. One thing that helps is having\nfriends who are cheerful. For example, I always find myself much more\ninclined to work after talking to Paul Graham or Dan Connolly \u2014 they\njust radiate energy. It\u2019s tempting to think that you need to get away\nfrom people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but\nthis can be so demoralizing that it\u2019s actually less efficient.\n\n#### Share the load\n\nEven if your friends aren\u2019t cheerful, just working on a hard problem\nwith someone else makes it *much* easier. For one thing, the mental\nweight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else\nthere forces you to work instead of getting distracted.\n\n#### Procrastination and the mental force field\n\nBut all of this is sort of dodging the issue. The real productivity\nproblem people have is procrastination. It\u2019s something of a dirty little\nsecret, but *everyone* procrastinates \u2014 severely. It\u2019s not just you. But\nthat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try to stop it.\n\nWhat is procrastination? To the outside observer, it looks like you\u2019re\njust doing something \u201cfun\u201d (like playing a game or reading the news)\ninstead of doing your actual work. (This usually causes the outside\nobserver to think you\u2019re lazy and bad.) But the real question is: what\u2019s\ngoing on inside your head?\n\nI\u2019ve spent a bunch of time trying to explore this and the best way I can\ndescribe it is that your brain puts up a sort of mental force field\naround a task. Ever play with two magnets? If you orient the magnets\nproperly and try to push them towards each other, they\u2019ll repel\nfiercely. As you move them around, you can sort of feel out the edges of\nthe magnetic field. And as you try to bring the magnets together, the\nfield will push you back or off in another direction.\n\nThe mental block seems to work in the same way. It\u2019s not particularly\nsolid or visible, but you can sort of feel it around the edges. And the\nmore you try to go towards it the more it pushes you away. And so, not\nsurprisingly, you end up going in another direction.^[3](#fn:s)^\n\nAnd just as you can\u2019t get two repelling magnets to sit together just by\npushing real hard \u2014 they\u2019ll fling back as soon as you stop pushing \u2014\nI\u2019ve never been able to overcome this mental force field through sheer\nwillpower. Instead, you have to be sneaky about it \u2014 you have to rotate\na magnet.\n\nSo what causes the mental force field? There appear to be two major\nfactors: whether the task is hard and whether it\u2019s assigned.\n\n##### Hard problems\n\n###### Break it down\n\nThe first kind of hard problem is the problem that\u2019s too big. Say you\nwant to build a recipe organizing program. Nobody can really just sit\ndown and build a recipe organizer. That\u2019s a goal, not a task. A task is\na specific concrete step you can take towards your goal. A good first\ntask might be something like \u201cdraw a mockup of the screen that displays\na recipe\u201d. Now that\u2019s something you can do.^[4](#fn:nc)^\n\nAnd when you do that, the next steps become clearer. You have to decide\nwhat a recipe consists of, what kind of search features are needed, how\nto structure the recipe database, and so on. You build up a momentum,\neach task leading to the next. And as your brain gets crunching on the\nsubject, it becomes easier to solve that subject\u2019s problems.\n\nFor each of my big projects, I think of all the tasks I can do next for\nthem and add them to my categorized todo list (see above). And when I\nstop working on something, I add its next possible tasks to the todo\nlist.\n\n###### Simplify it\n\nAnother kind of hard problem is the one that\u2019s too complicated or\naudacious. Writing a book seems daunting, so start by doing an essay. If\nan essay is too much, start by writing a paragraph summary. The\nimportant thing is to have something done right away.\n\nOnce you have something, you can judge it more accurately and understand\nthe problem better. It\u2019s also much easier to improve something that\nalready exists than to work at a blank page. If your paragraph goes\nwell, then maybe it can grow into an essay and then into a book, little\nby little, a perfectly reasonable piece of writing all the way through..\n\n###### Think about it\n\nOften the key to solving a hard problem will be getting some piece of\ninspiration. If you don\u2019t know much about the field, you should\nobviously start by researching it \u2014 see how other people did things, get\na sense of the terrain. Sit and try and understand the field fully. Do\nsome smaller problems to see if you have a handle on it.\n\n##### Assigned problems\n\nAssigned problems are problems you\u2019re told to work on. Numerous\npsychology experiments have found that when you try to \u201cincentivize\u201d\npeople to do something, they\u2019re less likely to do it and do a worse job.\nExternal incentives, like rewards and punishments, kills what\npsychologists call your \u201cintrinsic motivation\u201d \u2014 your natural interest\nin the problem. (This is one of the most thoroughly replicated findings\nof social psychology \u2014 over 70 studies have found that rewards undermine\ninterest in the task.)^[5](#fn:kohn)^ People\u2019s heads seem to have a deep\navoidance of being told what to do.^[6](#fn:avo)^\n\nThe weird thing is that this phenomenon isn\u2019t just limited to other\npeople \u2014 it even happens when you try to tell *yourself* what to do! If\nyou say to yourself, \u201cI should really work on X, that\u2019s the most\nimportant thing to do right now\u201d then all of the sudden X becomes the\ntoughest thing in the world to make yourself work on. But as soon as Y\nbecomes the most important thing, the exact same X becomes much easier.\n\n###### Create a false assignment\n\nThis presents a rather obvious solution: if you want to work on X, tell\nyourself to do Y. Unfortunately, it\u2019s sort of difficult to trick\nyourself intentionally, because you know you\u2019re doing it.^[7](#fn:feyn)^\nSo you\u2019ve got to be sneaky about it.\n\nOne way is to get someone else to assign something to you. The most\nfamous instance of this is grad students who are required to write a\ndissertation, a monumentally difficult task that they need to do to\ngraduate. And so, to avoid doing this, grad students end up doing all\nsorts of other hard stuff.\n\nThe task has to both seem important (you have to do this to graduate!)\nand big (hundreds of pages of your best work!) but not actually be so\nimportant that putting it off is going to be a disaster.\n\n###### Don\u2019t assign problems to yourself\n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to say \u201calright, I need to put all this aside, hunker\ndown and finish this essay\u201d. Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into\ndoing something, like saying \u201calright, if I just finish this essay then\nI\u2019ll go and eat some candy\u201d. But the absolute worst of all is to get\nsomeone else to try to force you to do something.\n\nAll of these are very tempting \u2014 I\u2019ve done them all myself \u2014 but they\u2019re\ncompletely counterproductive. In all three cases, you\u2019ve basically\nassigned yourself a task. Now your brain is going to do everything it\ncan to escape it.\n\n###### Make things fun\n\nHard work isn\u2019t supposed to be pleasant, we\u2019re told. But in fact it\u2019s\nprobably the most enjoyable thing I do. Not only does a tough problem\ncompletely absorb you while you\u2019re trying to solve it, but afterwards\nyou feel wonderful having accomplished something so serious.\n\nSo the secret to getting yourself to do something is not to convince\nyourself you have to do it, but to convince yourself that it\u2019s fun. And\nif it isn\u2019t, then you need to make it fun.\n\nI first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college.\nWriting essays isn\u2019t a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned.\nWho would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations\nof two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little\njokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little\nstyle, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the\nadded benefit of padding things out.)^[8](#fn:ex)^\n\nAnother way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem.\nInstead of building a web application, try building a web application\nframework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more\nenjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThere are a lot of myths about productivity \u2014 that time is fungible,\nthat focusing is good, that bribing yourself is effective, that hard\nwork is unpleasant, that procrastinating is unnatural \u2014 but they all\nhave a common theme: a conception of real work as something that goes\nagainst your natural inclinations.\n\nAnd for most people, in most jobs, this may be the case. There\u2019s no\nreason you should be inclined to write boring essays or file pointless\nmemos. And if society is going to force you to do so anyway, then you\nneed to learn to shut out the voices in your head telling you to stop.\n\nBut if you\u2019re trying to do something worthwhile and creative, then\nshutting down your brain is entirely the wrong way to go. The real\nsecret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat\nwhen you\u2019re hungry, to sleep when you\u2019re tired, to take a break when\nyou\u2019re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.\n\nIt seems all too simple. It doesn\u2019t involve any fancy acronyms or\nself-determination or personal testimonials from successful businessmen.\nIt almost seems like common sense. But society\u2019s conception of work has\npushed us in the opposite direction. If we want to be more productive,\nall we need to do is turn around.\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nIf you want to learn more about the pscyhology of motivation, there is\nnothing better than [Alfie Kohn](http://www.alfiekohn.org/). He\u2019s\nwritten [many articles on the\nsubject](http://www.alfiekohn.org/articles.htm) and an entire book,\n[Punished by Rewards](http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/pbr.htm), which I\nhighly recommend.\n\nI hope to address how to quit school in a future essay, but you should\nreally just go out and pick up *[The Teenage Liberation\nHandbook](http://www.lowryhousepublishers.com/TeenageLiberationHandbook.htm)*.\nIf you\u2019re a computer person, one way to quit your job is by applying for\nfunding from [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/). Meanwhile, Mickey\nZ\u2019s book *[The Murdering of My\nYears](http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-78-6)*\nfeatures artists and activists describing how they manage to make ends\nmeet while still doing what they want.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Believe it or not, I actually have written in subways. It\u2019s easy to\n    come up with excuses as to why you\u2019re not actually working \u2014 you\n    don\u2019t have enough time before your next appointment, people are\n    making noise downstairs, etc. \u2014 but I find that when the inspiration\n    strikes me, I can actually write stuff down on a subway car, where\n    it\u2019s absurdly loud and I only have a couple minutes before I have to\n    get out and start walking.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:sub)\n\n2.  The same problem exists for sleep. There\u2019s nothing worse than being\n    too tired to go to bed \u2014 you just feel like a zombie.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:t)\n\n3.  Now it turns out I experience this same phenomenon in another area:\n    shyness. I often don\u2019t want to call a stranger up on the phone or go\n    talk to someone at a party and I have the exact same mental field\n    pushing me off in some other direction. I suspect this might be\n    because shyness is also a trait that results from a problematic\n    childhood. (See \u201cAssigned problems\u201d.) Of course, this is all very\n    speculative.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:s)\n\n4.  While the terminology I use here (\u201cnext concrete step\u201d) is derived\n    from David Allen\u2019s *Getting Things Done*, a lot of the principles\n    here are (perhaps even unconsciously) applied in Extreme Programming\n    (XP). Extreme Programming is presented as this system for keeping\n    programs organized, but I find that a lot of it is actually good\n    advice for avoid procrastination.\n\n    For example, pair programming automatically spreads the mental\n    weight of the task across two people as well as giving people\n    something useful to do during lower-quality time. Breaking a project\n    down into concrete steps is another key part of XP, as is getting\n    something that works done right away and improving on it (\u201cSimplify\n    it\u201d *infra*). And these are just the things that aren\u2019t\n    programming-specific.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:nc)\n\n5.  For a fantastic overview of the literature, see Alfie Kohn,\n    *Punished By Rewards*.

I originally simply assumed this was somehow biological, but Paul\n    Graham pointed out it\u2019s more likely learned. When you\u2019re little,\n    your parents try their best to manipulate you.

Anonymous speech is a First Amendment right.\n\nAnd yet, on the supposedly Wild West frontier of the Internet,\npublishing anonymously is not so easy. Hosting providers require a name\nand credit card, which they have to hand over to the FBi at the drop of\na National Security Letter. Free hosting sites zealously obey takedown\nrequests and require publishers to reveal their identity if they want\ntheir stuff put back up (a tactic Scientologists have used). Luckily\nthere are now services like [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org/), but they\nonly publish a very narrow range of content.\n\nBut, talking with Virgil Griffith and others, I hit upon a new way of\nallowing for anonymous publishing. The amazing [Tor\nproject](http://www.torproject.org/) lets you use the Internet\nanonymously, by disguising your traffic thru a long series of relays.\nLess well-known is that it also allows for anonymous publishing, by\nrunning the system in reverse. Unfortunately, you need the Tor software\nto visit anonymously-published sites, but we realized there\u2019s no reason\nthis need be so.\n\nSo I dusted off some work I\u2019d begun years and years ago and build a\ntor2web proxy. Now anyone with a web browser can visit an anonymous Tor\nURL like\n[http://sexy36iscapohm7b.onion/](http://sexy36iscapohm7b.onion/) from\nany Web browser, without any special software, just by going to:\n\n[http://sexy36iscapohm7b.tor.theinfo.org/](http://sexy36iscapohm7b.tor.theinfo.org/)\n\nWhich means that publishing an anonymous website is now also fairly\neasy. ([There are instructions on the Tor\nsite](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en) \u2014 just\nreplace the `.onion` when you hand out the URL. If that\u2019s too tricky,\nyou could use an existing provider like [Freedom\nHosting](http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.tor.theinfo.org/).)\n\ntor2web proxies act like any other sort of proxy or router; they just\nroute traffic from a client to a server and don\u2019t get involved\nthemselves, so they can\u2019t be held legally responsible for the content\nthat passes thru them.

The Stockholm airport tries hard to sell you on the city\u2019s\nimportance, lining the walls with the faces of famous residents, none of\nwhom I recognize. Stockholm is \u201cThe Capital of Scandinavia\u201d, at least\naccording to the wall, the information desk, and the \u201cYou Are Here\u201d\nsigns spread around the city. All the signs are in English as well as\nSwedish and we didn\u2019t see a single person the entire trip who couldn\u2019t\nspeak English (although one declined to).\n\nNor does the ride from the airport suggest anything special \u2014 the road\nis lined with the office parks of big companies, much like the streets\nof Silicon Valley. And the city seems, well, like a city, at least until\nyou realize that\u2019s your apartment, not simply downtown.\n\nMost American cities are still suffering from the \u201curban planning\u201d\ndesigned to keep non-existent factory fumes away from people\u2019s homes.\nEven in San Francisco, where all sorts of crazy things are crammed into\none small peninsula, there is still a clear separation of residence and\nbusiness \u2014 blocks of victorian row houses, then a cross street with a\nbunch of shops.\n\nBut as far as I could tell, Stockholm doesn\u2019t have any such residential\nzones. All the apartments seemed to be on the floor above the normal\nstreet life; the two deeply intertwingled; just the way I like it. (See\n*The Death and Life of Great American Cities* for more reasons.)\n\nThe apartments \u2014 *all* the apartments \u2014 are rent controlled, one of the\nsocialist remnants in Sweden\u2019s social democracy. In practice, this leads\nto some odd results. No one ever gives up an apartment, so tenants feel\nsafe installing nameplates on their doors. Instead of giving up the\nplace, they give it to their family, their friends, or let their\nchildren inherit it. Once you have an apartment contract, you can swap\nit with anyone else\u2019s (and there are web sites to help you do this), but\nto get one you need to add your name to a list when you turn 18, and\nthen wait for ten to twenty years for an apartment to open up. Those\nwith money but not that kind of time instead pay under the table for a\ncontract.\n\nThere are no homeless people in Stockholm, but one person I spoke to\nclaimed that this was because the homeless didn\u2019t know anyone with a\nrent contract, so they all stayed in the suburbs, which they were more\nfamiliar with anyway, and as a result there ended up being about as many\nhomeless per capita as in a the average American city.\n\nBacklash politics is incredibly popular in the US, where there\u2019s not\nthat much to backlash against, but it\u2019s even more popular in Sweden,\nwhere there\u2019s some justification. US-style libertarians are everywhere,\nthis time with some actual justification for their persecution\ncomplexes. Although not much. A new conservative government has recently\ntaken power and has pulled all the libertarians out to fill up the\npolitical positions.\n\nOur roommate just happened to hang out with libertarians in college; now\nall her friends are top officials in the government. A smaller country,\nit starts to seem like everyone knows everybody here (I suppose they all\nwent to college together).\n\nOf course, there are still outsiders. The country has private email\nmailing lists on which all the gossip about how the county is *actually*\nrun (and who the royalty is *actually* screwing) is shared among the\nprominent journalists and other figures. (There are similar secret lists\nin other fields, including one for the left-wing of the US Democratic\nParty.) Journalists know that sharing that kind of information with the\npublic simply isn\u2019t done and those who violate the rules are\nunceremoniously kicked off. Occasionally a young reporter uses their\ncolumn to complain they\u2019re not on the list, but the people in the know\njust laugh at them.\n\nIt\u2019s the same kind of laugh you imagine Sweden\u2019s IKEA founders having\n[as you marvel at their clever tax-dodging\nschemes](http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6919139).\nIKEA, the famed Swedish interior design chain now sweeping the US, is\nowned by a company called Ingka Holding, which is actually owned by a\ntax-exempt not-for-profit \u2014 the world\u2019s largest, even larger than the\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Not that selling interior\nfurnishings is at all comparable to curing Malaria.) The not-for-profit\nchannels its funds to a Dutch foundation which is operated by a Swiss\nlawyer friend but shares some of its assets with another Dutch company\nwhich is owned by a Luxembourg holding company which is owned by a\ncompany in the Netherlands which is run by a trust in the Carribean. You\ncan probably guess where the tax-free money goes from there.\n\nIKEA is everywhere in Sweden. Their couches fill the tiny\nrent-controlled apartments, their chairs are found in everyone\u2019s\noffices, and when you finish your drink the light shining through the\nbottom of the glass illuminates the word: IKEA.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6919139"], "time": 1168416000.0, "postid": "visitingsweden", "internal_links": []}, "july4": {"post_title": "SFP: The Spirit Inside", "tags": [], "post_content": "SFP: The Spirit Inside\n======================\n\nJuly 5, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/july4)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe sun has set leaving the street lights to cast everything in an eerie\nyellow glow.

The reason so many people were out of work\nwas not really because of irresponsible banks or high taxes or reckless\ngovernment policy. It was really much simpler than all that: there\nwasn\u2019t enough money.\n\nNow, as individuals, we\u2019d all like a little more money for ourselves.\nBut pause for a moment and think about what it means if there isn\u2019t\nenough money in the economy as a *whole*. A good way to wrap your head\naround this is to think about a much smaller case: instead of the whole\neconomy, let\u2019s think about a now-famous babysitting co-op on Capitol\nHill. Instead of dollars, the co-op used its own scrip that was worth an\nhour of babysitting time. When you wanted to go out, you\u2019d pay a couple\nhours to someone else to watch your kids; then when they wanted to go\nout, they\u2019d pay you or someone else to do the same for them.\n\nIt all worked great for a while, until one day they found they had too\nfew pieces of scrip. Every couple had only a couple hours left and,\nhaving so little, they didn\u2019t want to waste it. So they all decided to\nsave it for a very special occasion. This was kind of an incredible\nsituation \u2014 even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit\ntheir kids, and people who were willing to do just that, the deal didn\u2019t\nhappen, simply because the co-op hadn\u2019t printed enough colored pieces of\npaper. Eventually the co-op learned their mistake, printed some more\nscrip and handed it out, and everybody went back to babysitting like\nbefore and were much happier for it.\n\nThe same thing happens in the real economy. When there aren\u2019t enough\ngreen-colored pieces of paper around, everybody gets worried and holds\non to the little they have. Even if you\u2019d like someone to build an\nextension on your house, and there\u2019s someone else out there who\u2019d like\nto build an extension on your house, the deal doesn\u2019t happen, just\nbecause you don\u2019t have enough green pieces of paper (or, more\nrealistically, dollars in your bank account). This is a total waste. You\ndon\u2019t get the extension and the other guy doesn\u2019t get a job, all because\nwe haven\u2019t run the printing presses enough (or added enough zeroes to\nthe bank\u2019s computers).\n\nBefore the Great Depression, most countries wouldn\u2019t simply print more\ncolored pieces of paper. They were on the \u201cgold standard\u201d and they would\nonly print more currency when more gold was discovered. This led to the\nmost bizarre series of booms and busts as more gold was discovered in\nstrange places and then \u201cused up\u201d by population growth or other things.\nAfter Keynes, countries eventually stopped this silliness and just\nstarted printing their money directly. [As soon as they abandoned the\ngold\nstandard](http://phoenixwoman.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/delong-march2009.jpg),\nthey begun recovering from the Great Depression.\n\nBut the power to print more money is obviously a very special power and\nyou wouldn\u2019t want it to fall into the wrong hands. So, in the United\nStates, we\u2019ve taken it away from elected politicians and given it\n(mostly) to the big banks. The banks select people to run their local\nFederal Reserve and then some of those people (along with some\nadditional folks nominated by the President) are selected to be members\nof a group called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC,\nessentially, decides how much money there should be in circulation,\nwhich in turn decides how many people have jobs.\n\nYou might think this sounds crazy \u2014 a bunch of unelected bankers get to\ndecide how many people have jobs? \u2014 and, in fact, it is crazy. But I\u2019m\nnot making it up. Ask a macroeconomist, like Paul Krugman, and this is\nexactly what he\u2019ll tell you. And if you look in the Federal Reserve Act\nor on the Fed\u2019s website, you\u2019ll find their\n[mission](http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm) is to\n\u201cpromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and\nmoderate long-term interest rates.\u201d These multiple goals are relatively\nrecent; before 1978, the goal was simply \u201cmaximum employment,\nproduction, and purchasing power.\u201d\n\nNow some people will claim that the Federal Reserve has done all it can\nto create more jobs but the recession is so deep this time that there\u2019s\nnothing else it can do. But that\u2019s just not true \u2014 even the chairman of\nthe Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, says it\u2019s not true. He was asked\nabout this in a Senate hearing. As the *Economist* [summarized his\nresponse](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/12/from_the_horses_mouth):\n\u201cMr Bernanke does not want to risk a de-anchoring of inflation\nexpectations. He is willing to accept 10% or greater unemployment and\nthe resulting economic and political fall-out in order to avoid that\nrisk.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to the subject of inflation. Obviously if you print a\nlot of new money, it makes existing money worth a little less. This is\nannoying, but is it worse than having people out of work? Well, it\ndepends who you are. If you have a lot of money, you\u2019re more worried\nabout it becoming worth less. But if you work for a living, you\u2019re more\nworried about people being out of work. As you might expect, Mr.\nBernanke has a lot of money, as do the other bankers on the committee\nand the people who selected them. So they\u2019ve decided to let millions and\nmillions of people be unemployed and the rest of us experience the\nresulting recession rather than risk the chance that some of their money\nmight be worth a little less.\n\nThe biggest reason this is possible is because nobody realizes it. If it\nwas conventional wisdom that a bunch of unelected bankers looking out\nfor rich people were the reason everyone was out of work, politicians\nwould be forced to explain to angry voters why we had this crazy system\nand might actually consider doing something about it. But, incredibly,\nit just seems like nobody has any idea. Voters don\u2019t realize it,\npoliticians don\u2019t understand it, journalists don\u2019t cover it. And, in\nfact, they\u2019re so far from having any idea that it\u2019s really difficult to\nexplain it to them. When you say a bunch of unelected bankers are the\nreason there are no jobs, they just look at you like you\u2019re crazy. I\u2019ve\njust spent a page or two explaining it and you still probably think I\u2019m\ncrazy. But it\u2019s true! This isn\u2019t some Ron Paul-type crackpot idea; this\nis mainstream economics, from Paul Krugman to the head of George W.\nBush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors.\n\nI feel a bit like the guy in one of those movies, going around and\ntelling everyone that the murderer is standing right over there \u2014 right\nthere, look! \u2014 but nobody believes him and people continue to die. It\u2019s\nincredibly frustrating, and I have no idea what to do about it.\n\nOne final point: How did we get into this mess in the first place? Why\ndid we suddenly find ourselves without enough money? Well, there was a\nhousing bubble: for many years, house prices kept going up and up for no\nother reason than everyone was betting that they were just going to keep\ngoing up. When house prices were unsustainably high, that was part of\nthe money in circulation.

I\u2019m a cofounder of [the Progressive Change Campaign\nCommittee](http://boldprogressives.org/) (BoldProgressives.org) and I\nspend my days experimenting with new ways to get progressive policies\nenacted and progressive politicians elected.\n\nLike a lot of people, I grew up feeling frustrated with the world \u2014\nextremes of wealth and poverty, insane and bloody wars, outdated\nintellectual monopoly laws, big corporations run amok. But I had no idea\nwhat to do about it. Writing just felt like preaching to the choir,\nmarching in the streets felt like the protest of the powerless, working\nwith people on the ground just didn\u2019t seem to scale.\n\nBut when my friend Larry Lessig decided to run for Congress, I begun to\nsee that there was something I could do. During the short-lived\ncampaign, we were besieged with offers of help from consultants,\nsoftware companies, and services firms. Their technology was invariably\noutdated and incompetent (the leading tools are built on SQL Server),\nuncoordinated and poorly-designed. The advice they gave was horrendous,\ntheir incompetence bordered on sabotage, and the prices they charged\nwould bankrupt us.\n\nWe started the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in January 2009\nwith the notion that we could fix all that. We would help filter the\ngood consultants from the bad, write up best practices and conduct\nexperiments to learn what works. Along the way, we got pulled into issue\ncampaigns as well \u2014 at first [going after CNBC for their terrible\ncoverage of the economic crisis](http://fixcnbc.com/), then spending\nmost of the last year [getting Congress to pass a public option in the\nhealth care bill](http://whipcongress.com/). Along the way, we\u2019ve gotten\nover 400,000 members and raised over a million dollars for our various\ntactics. Not bad for our first year!\n\nBut now, as the 2010 campaigns ramp up, we\u2019re getting back to our\noriginal mission. We\u2019ve been working with campaigns to help them find\ntalented staff, competent consultants, and money-saving techniques. But\nwe also need some talented programmers to build the next generation of\ncampaign tools.

Hundreds from all over the world\ngathered there to discuss the magic that is Wikipedia, thinking hard\nabout what it means and why it works. It was an amazing intellectual and\nemotional experience.\n\nThe main attraction was seeing the vibrant Wikipedia community. There\nwere the hardcore Wikipedians, who spend their days reviewing changes\nand fixing pages. And there were the elder statesmen, like Larry Lessig\nand Brewster Kahle, who came to meet the first group and tell them how\ntheir work fits into a bigger picture. Spending time with all these\npeople was amazing fun \u2014 they\u2019re all incredibly bright, enthusiastic\nand, most shockingly, completely dedicated to a cause greater than\nthemselves.\n\nAt most \u201ctechnology\u201d conferences I\u2019ve been to, the participants\ngenerally talk about technology for its own sake. If *use* ever gets\ndiscussed, it\u2019s only about using it to make vast sums of money. But at\nWikimania, the primary concern was doing the most good for the world,\nwith technology as the tool to help us get there. It was an incredible\ngust of fresh air, one that knocked me off my feet.\n\nThere was another group attending, however: the people holding up the\nplatform on which this whole community stands. I spent the first few\ndays with the mostly-volunteer crew of hackers who keep the websites up\nand running. In later days, I talked to the site administrators who\nexercise the power that the software gives them. And I heard much about\nthe Wikimedia Foundation, the not-for-profit that controls and runs the\nsites.\n\nMuch to my surprise, this second group was almost the opposite of the\nfirst. With a few notable exceptions, when they were off-stage they\ntalked gossip and details: how do we make the code stop doing this, how\ndo we get people to stop complaining about that, how can we get this\nother group to like us more. Larger goals or grander visions didn\u2019t come\nup in their private conversations; instead they seemed absorbed by the\nissues of the present.\n\nOf course, they have plenty to be absorbed by. Since January,\nWikipedia\u2019s traffic has more than doubled and this group is beginning to\nstrain under the load. At the technical level, the software development\nand server systems are both managed by just one person, Brion Vibber,\nwho appears to have his hands more-than-full just keeping everything\nrunning. The entire system has been cobbled together as the site has\ngrown, a messy mix of different kinds of computers and code, and keeping\nit all running sounds like a daily nightmare. As a result, actual\nsoftware development goes rather slowly, which cannot help but affect\nthe development of the larger project.\n\nThe small coterie of site administrators, meanwhile, are busy dealing\nwith the ever-increasing stream of complaints from the public. The\nrecent Seigenthaler affair, in which the founding editor of *USA Today*\nnoisily attacked Wikipedia for containing an grievous error in its\narticle on him, has made people very cautious about how Wikipedia treats\nliving people. (Although [to judge just from the traffic\nnumbers](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/wikigrowth), one might think more\nsuch affairs might be a good idea\u2026) One administrator told me how he\nspends his time scrubbing Wikipedia clean of unflattering facts about\npeople who call the head office to complain.\n\nFinally, the Wikimedia Foundation Board seems to have devolved into\ninaction and infighting. Just four people have been actually hired by\nthe Foundation, and even they seem unsure of their role in a\nlargely-volunteer community. Little about this group \u2014 which, quite\nliterally, controls Wikipedia \u2014 is known by the public. Even when they\nwere talking to dedicated Wikipedians at the conference, they put a\npublic face on things, saying little more than \u201cdon\u2019t you folks worry,\nwe\u2019ll straighten everything out\u201d.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe plain fact is that Wikipedia\u2019s gotten too big to be run by just a\ncouple of people. One way or another, it\u2019s going to have to become an\norganization; the question is what kind. Organizational structures are\nfar from neutral: whose input gets included decides what actions get\ntaken, the positions that get filled decide what things get focused on,\nthe vision at the top sets the path that will be followed.\n\nI worry that Wikipedia, as we know it, might not last. That its feisty\ndemocracy might ossify into staid bureaucracy, that its innovation might\nstagnate into conservatism, that its growth might slow to stasis. Were\nsuch things to happen, I know I could not just stand by and watch the\ntragedy. Wikipedia is just too important \u2014 both as a resource and as a\nmodel \u2014 to see fail.\n\nThat is why, after much consideration, I\u2019ve decided to run for a seat on\nthe Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s Board. I\u2019ve been a fairly dedicated\nWikipedian since 2003, adding and editing pages whenever I came across\nthem. I\u2019ve gone to a handful of Wikipedia meetups and even got my photo\non the front page of the *Boston Globe* as an example Wikipedian. But\nI\u2019ve never gotten particularly involved in Wikipedia politics \u2014 I\u2019m not\nan administrator, I don\u2019t get involved in policy debates, I hardly even\nargue on the \u201ctalk pages\u201d. Mostly, I just edit.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I wish I could stay that way. When people at\nWikimania suggested I run for a Board seat, I shrugged off the idea. But\nsince then, I\u2019ve become increasingly convinced that I should run, if\nonly to bring attention to these issues. Nobody else seems to be\nseriously discussing this challenge.\n\nThe election begins today and lasts three weeks. As it rolls on, I plan\nto regularly publish essays like this one, examining the questions that\nface Wikipedia in depth. Whether I win or not, I hope we can use this\nopportunity for a grand discussion about where we should be heading and\nwhat we can do to get there. That said, if you\u2019re an eligible\nWikipedian, I hope that you\u2019ll please [vote for\nme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election).\n", "external_links": ["mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election"], "time": 1157007600.0, "postid": "wikiroads", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/wikigrowth"]}, "psuedoscientism": {"post_title": "That Isn\u2019t Science!", "tags": [], "post_content": "That Isn\u2019t Science!\n===================\n\nOctober 18, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/psuedoscientism)\n\n* * * * *\n\nLarry Wall once noted that the scientificness of a field is inversely\ncorrelated to how much the word \u201cscience\u201d appears in its name. Physics,\nof course, doesn\u2019t have science in the name and is the most scientific\nof all sciences. Then comes biology and and ethology and so on. Then\ncome the non-sciences like Computer Science and Poultry Science. And\nworst of all is Scientology.\n\nIn general, whenever someone tells you that \u201cscience\u201d has decreed that\nyou should do one thing or another that doesn\u2019t seem reasonable, it\u2019s\nprobably because they\u2019re trying to pull one over on you, whether it\u2019s\nthe \u201cscientific\u201d medicines you see on late-night TV or the science of\nthe behaviorists who say you shouldn\u2019t love your kids.\n\nBut nowhere is this more evident than when people try to tell you what\nscience itself is. This field of meta-science seems to attract more\ncharlatans and malintents than any other. If you control how the very\nnotion of what\u2019s scientific is defined \u2014 well, then that\u2019s real power.\nEven if the very idea is patently absurd. (A real scientist would never\ntell you that doing X isn\u2019t really science; their goal is to get the\ntruth, not sit around making rules about who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out.)\n\nFor much of the outside world, the test for a real science is\n\u201cfalsifiability\u201d \u2014 the possibility that there could be evidence proving\nthe claim wrong. This notion was invented by Karl Popper, who was\nhimself [an enemy of\nscience](http://www.geocities.com/Krishna_kunchith/dcs/popper/popper.html)\nwho tried to insist that science never actually made any progress, that\nwe never learned anything more about the world.\n\nBut even if we put aside this noxious pedigree, Popper\u2019s definition is\nstill absurd. Take the distinction between astronomy and astrology. We\nwould all agree, I think, that the first is a science but the second\nisn\u2019t. But both of their predictions are equally falsifiable \u2014 astrology\nmakes a dozen falsifiable predictions in the newspaper five times a\nweek. Popper\u2019s criteria isn\u2019t of much help to us, even on such a basic\ncase.\n\nSadly, like many American intellectuals, the Supreme Court assumed that\nfalsifiability was a standard scientific test. In the *Daubert* case it,\n[as Chris Mooney summarizes the view of the *American Journal of Public\nHealth*](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10061),\n\u201cblundered miserably\u201d and set judges the task of using this \u201cdeeply\nconfused philosophy of science\u201d to act as gatekeepers in keeping\nscientific claims from juries. Actual scientists like\n[DefendingScience.org](http://defendingscience.org/) is working to undo\nthis these mistakes, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the rhetoric \u2014 after\nall, *Daubert*\u2019s defenders claim their just trying to uphold sound\nscientific standards. (Chris Mooney\u2019s book *The Republican War on\nScience*, among others, has a fascinating expos\u00e9 of the junk\nscience/sound science notions cooked up by the PR industry to trash\nactual science. But that\u2019s another subject.)\n\nWhat are the real effects, though? Daubert was a parent whose child was\nborn with birth defects they believed were caused by the drug Benedictin\nwhich, in animal studies, appeared to cause the defects they were\nsuffering. By making it harder for science to be presented in Court,\nthese kinds of rulings make it easier for drug companies to claim\nthere\u2019s no \u201csound science\u201d that they\u2019re hurting anyone.\n\nAmerica isn\u2019t alone, however. In Britain a group supporting what they\ncall \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d is trying to tighten restrictions on what\nexperiments can be examined when approving drugs. Evidence-based\nmedicine? Who could be against that! But again, they\u2019re playing the same\ngames. Behind evidence-based science are a bunch of very bizarre claims\nabout what science is and isn\u2019t, taken not from doctors or scientists,\nbut from econometricians (the subspecialty of economics that has to do\nwith calculating things), which have quite a few problems of their own\nwhen it comes to the subject of evidence.\n\nUnder \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d rules, doctors aren\u2019t allowed to\nprescribe drugs on the basis of case studies and other reports; instead,\nthe only real evidence are large double-blind random controlled trials\nwhose results have a less than 5% probability of being due to chance.\n(Why 5%? No good reason. But according to the EBM people anything more\nthan that isn\u2019t evidence.)\n\nAgain, you have the same negative effects: when someone tries to claim\nin court that a certain drug destroyed their life, the drug company can\nclaim that there\u2019s no \u201cevidence\u201d to support this if the studies just\nhappen to be 94% likely instead of 95%, or if there\u2019s only a series of\ncase studies instead of a controlled trial.\n\nThis isn\u2019t evidence, this isn\u2019t rationality, this isn\u2019t science. Science\nis about trying to get the truth about the world, using whatever\nmechanisms are most effective at the job, whether you\u2019re studying the\nnature of planets in space or the nature of other cultures. When someone\ntells you otherwise, tries to insist that technique X or subject Y\ndoesn\u2019t deserve the name science, it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re trying\nto pull a fast one on you.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.geocities.com/Krishna_kunchith/dcs/popper/popper.html", "http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10061", "http://defendingscience.org/"], "time": 1161154800.0, "postid": "psuedoscientism", "internal_links": []}, "morewikipedians": {"post_title": "Making More Wikipedians", "tags": [], "post_content": "Making More Wikipedians\n=======================\n\nSeptember 11, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians)\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Wikimedia 2006 Elections**\n\nPart 1: [Wikimedia at the\nCrossroads](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads)\\\n Part 2: [Who Writes\nWikipedia?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)\\\n Part 3: [Who Runs\nWikipedia?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia)\\\n Part 4: **Making More Wikipedians**\\\n Part 5: [Making More\nWikipedias](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias)\\\n Part 6: [Code, and Other\nLaws](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw)\\\n\nIf you translate this essay, please [contact me](mailto:me@aaronsw.com).\n\n**[Vote for me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election)** in\nthe election for the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nWikipedia, the Vice President of the *World Book* told us, is now\nrecognized by ten percent of Americans. He presented this in a tone of\ncongratulation: with no marketing budget or formal organization, a free\nonline-only encyclopedia written by volunteers had achieved a vast\namount of attention. But I took it a different way. \u201cOnly ten percent?\u201d\nI thought. \u201cThat means we have ninety percent to go!\u201d\n\nWikipedia is one of the few things that pretty much everyone finds\nuseful. So how do we get all of them to use it? The first task, it\nappears, is telling them it exists. An ad campaign or PR blitz doesn\u2019t\nquite seem appropriate for the job, though. Instead, our promotion\nshould work the same way way the rest of Wikipedia works: let the\ncommunity do it.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s users come from all over society: different cultures,\ndifferent countries, different places, different fields of study. The\nphysics grad students who contribute heavily to physics articles are in\na much better position to promote it to physicists than a promotional\nflack from the head office. The Pokemon fan maintaining the Pokemon\narticles probably knows how to reach other Pokemaniacs than any\nmarketing expert.\n\nSure, you might say, but isn\u2019t the whole question of marketing Wikipedia\nsomewhat silly? After all, you obviously know about Wikipedia, and your\nfriends probably all seem to as well. But things are a lot thinner than\nyou might expect: as noted above, only one in ten Americans even knows\nwhat Wikipedia is, and most of those don\u2019t truly understand it.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking to discover how even smart, technically-minded people\ncan\u2019t figure out how to actually edit Wikipedia. Dave Winer wrote some\nof the first software to have an \u201cEdit This Page\u201d button (indeed, he\noperated editthispage.com for many years) and yet he at first complained\nthat he couldn\u2019t figure out how to edit a page on Wikipedia. Michael\nArrington reviews advanced Web 2.0 websites daily, yet [he\nnoted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/07/12/profile-wikipedia/) that\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t realize how easy it is for anyone to add content to\nwikipedia (I\u2019ve done it several times)\u201d. If prominent technologists have\ntrouble, imagine the rest of the world.\n\nObviously, this has implications for the software side: we need to work\nhard on making Wikipedia\u2019s interface clearer and more usable. But\nthere\u2019s also a task here for the community: giving talks and tutorials\nto groups that you know about, explaining the core ideas behind\nWikipedia, and giving demonstrations of how to get involved in it. The\nbest interface in the world is no substitute for real instruction and\neven the clearest document explaining our principles will be ignored in\na way that a personal presentation won\u2019t.\n\nBut beyond simply giving people the ability to contribute, we need to\nwork to make contributing more rewarding. [As I previously\nnoted](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowritescomments), many people decide\nto dive into writing for Wikipedia, only to watch their contributions be\nsummarily reverted. Many people create a new article, only to see it get\ndeleted after an AfD discussion where random Wikipedians try to think up\nnegative things to say about it. For someone who thought they were\ndonating their time to help the project, neither response is\nparticularly encouraging.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that we should change our policies or automatically keep\neverything a newcomer decides to add so we don\u2019t hurt their feelings.\nBut we do need to think more about how to enforce policies without\nturning valuable newcomers away, how we can educate them instead of\nalienating them.\n\nAt Wikimania, no less an authority than Richard Stallman (who himself\nlong ago [suggested the idea](http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/) of a\nfree online encyclopedia) wandered around the conference complaining\nabout a problem he\u2019d discovered with a particular Wikipedia article. He\ncould try to fix it himself, he noted, but it would take an enormous\namount of his time and the word would probably just get reverted. He\u2019s\nnot the only one \u2014 I constantly hear tales from experts about problems\nthey encounter on Wikipedia, but are too complicated for them to fix\nalone. What if we could collect these complaints on the site, instead of\nhaving these people make them at parties?\n\nOne way to do that would be to have some sort of complaint-tracking\nsystem for articles, like the discussion system of talk pages. Instead\nof simply complaining about an article in public, Stallman could follow\na link from it to file a complaint. The complaint would be tracked and\nstored with the article.

I\u2019m sitting in a small cafe, reading my little\nbook, eating my little breakfast. I\u2019m the only customer around and the\nemployees seem to have forgotten there\u2019s even me, so they start gabbing\nto themselves. The Mexican immigrant chef is chatting to the high school\ndropout waitress. Pause here and ask yourself what these two people\nmight talk to each other about in their spare time. Try and think about\nwhat you might talk to them about were you in such a situation. Now\nrecall that you\u2019re in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They were talking, quite\nanimatedly, about the demographic trends for marriage under\nEuropean-style social democracy.\n\nThey quickly shut up when a girl walked in. \u201cThe usual?\u201d asked the girl\nbehind the counter. \u201cYep,\u201d said the girl coming in the door. The order\nwas prepared and delivered while the two girls chatted politely. Then\nthe girl took her food and left. \u201cGod, I hate her,\u201d said the girl behind\nthe counter. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how an idiot like that goes to Tufts.\nShe doesn\u2019t care anything about *ideas*.\u201d\n\nCollege towns are funny.\n\n* * * * *\n\nRecently, Seth Roberts and I have embarked on an odd little project.\nWe\u2019ve gone to various colleges in the area and asked kids why they\u2019re\nthere. The first day was at Berkeley and as I walked through Sproul\nPlaza at noon, kids of every shape and description trying to push fliers\nand come-ons in my face as I just tried to look around, I had a feeling\nit wasn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nSeth was wearing a tattered brown jacket and had a not-entirely-shaved\nface and, to be honest, looked a little odd. So when he went up to\nstudents and asked them if they had a minute, everyone said no. We went\nthrough five or six awkward such rejections until we realized that he\nshould start off by saying he was a tenured professor at Berkeley.\nNobody said no after that; apparently people initially thought he was a\nhomeless person.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFor right or wrong, I\u2019d come to think of random people as boring. In\npart, I think this is because I\u2019m shy, and I feel less bad about my\ninability to make conversation with strangers if I can persuade myself\nthat the conversation isn\u2019t going to be worthwhile. After months of\ntrying to make my way through desultory conversations with other\nStanford students (\u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know yet. You?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet either.\u201d) I finally gave up and spent the rest of my\ntime there with my nose in a book.\n\nAnd part, perhaps, is that average people just have a really bad rap.\nBooks complain about the anti-intellectualism of American culture.\nProfessors complain about the students who don\u2019t care about the work.\nNewspapers complain about the ignorant red state-filling wingnuts. The\naverage person seems like a dangerous entity, like the fellow at the\nlecture with the long and rambling not-quite-a-question that makes you\nthink that maybe elitism isn\u2019t such a bad idea after all.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe average people are actually like that. Maybe\ncollege towns are funny.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWe went to three colleges: Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Berkeley City\nCollege. The colleges are quite different. Stanford is a large elite\nschool for people who want to become professionals. (I\u2019d always heard\nthis from my teachers, that Stanford was a place of people who were\npre-med and pre-law and pre-grad school, but I wondered how big the\neffect was. As I was sitting down to interview our first Stanford\nsubject, I wondered if we\u2019d interview enough people to be able to notice\nthe difference. That\u2019s when she explained that she was pre-med.)\n\nUC Berkeley is a state school, although a respected one, with a large\ncampus, although mixed in with an interesting city. (Stanford is almost\nliterally surrounded by a moat.) And Berkeley City College is a junior\ncollege, in an attractive new building in the middle of the city, full\nof people who want to transfer out of there and into the real thing.\n\nThere were differences between the schools, of course, but more\nnoticeable was the basic fundamental similarities. Everyone we spoke to,\nwith one exception, was intelligent, articulate, had coherent thoughts\nabout their situation and its place in the larger context, and was\nsomeone I enjoyed talking to. (The one exception was even more\nthought-provoking and made me wonder what it meant to be intelligent and\nwhy I felt so uncomfortable around him.)\n\nSeth was much braver than I and took most of the brunt of the\nconversation, leaving me to observe and reflect quietly. But even just\nwatching random conversations with random people was a thoroughly\nrewarding experience. I felt as if it was some essential task of\nhumanity that I had heretofore neglected.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEveryone we interviewed stands out, but perhaps a few examples will give\nyou the flavor of people\u2019s situations. There was the young man at\nStanford who had started a web-based business with his friends from high\nschool. He soon realized that they were in an overcompetitive market and\nduring his first year at Stanford had reconfigured their business plan\nto target a new space. Meanwhile, he planned to take business classes to\nget a more academic grounding in his profession.\n\nThere was the African-American girl at UC Berkeley who loved her courses\nin African-American Studies, how they revealed a secret history of her\ncountry that she\u2019d never before heard told. She couldn\u2019t see making a\nliving in the subject, of course, but she wanted to study it while she\ncould, before she had to find a real job. A job like, if she had to pick\nright now, probably teaching.\n\nThere was the Berkeley City College student who had done three years of\ncollege in Chile, spent a couple years in Germany, and now worked in\nBerkeley as a professional dancer, hoping to get college credit so she\ncould get a job doing Latin American human rights work, ideally for the\nUN.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI am not sure what to say to these people. I understand the paths their\nlives are on and I see the flaws in the institutions in which they\nreside, but I have trouble imagining how I can fix things for them, as\npeople. The problem with psychologists, sociologists complain, is that\nthey\u2019re too obsessed with individual people. And the problem with focus\ngroups, even though they were invented by a sociologist, is that people\nare too obsessed with themselves. They see their problems, they see the\ncontext, and they reflect on them, but it\u2019s not clear to either of us\nhow they can particularly be remedied. The situations are just too big.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1171440000.0, "postid": "avgpeople", "internal_links": []}, "dearcolleagues": {"post_title": "Dear Colleagues: Orders from China\u2019s Minister of Internet Censorship", "tags": [], "post_content": "Dear Colleagues: Orders from China\u2019s Minister of Internet Censorship\n====================================================================\n\nOctober 12, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dearcolleagues)\n\n* * * * *\n\nfrom \u201c[Journey to the Heart of Internet\nCensorship](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23924)\u201d\n\n> The *Xinhua* exclusive \u201cWho is most hurt by the Web?\u201d is available at\n> the follow address:\n> [http://news.xinhuanet.com/focus/2006-05-08/content\\_4494204.htm](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://news.xinhuanet.com/focus/2006-05/08/content_4494204.htm&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522content_4494204%2522%26num%3D30%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff).\n> It contains many articles, so each site is asked to put a link on its\n> home page so that Internet users can read them directly on the Xinhua\n> site.

Musicians, in formal\nclothes, sit in a carefully-designed arrangement high above the audience\nwho (also usually in formal clothes) sits in seats and applauds at\nformally-appropriate moments (recall the odd paradox of most of the\naudience unsure when to clap; is it the end of the piece or just the end\nof the movement?). The music performed is also often formal, classical\nmusic, like fine art generally, typically signifying something a cut\nabove everyday life.\n\nThis is challenged somewhat by things like the Boston Pops, a symphony\nwho, for the 4th of July, performed \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d with Neil Diamond\nto a crowd of people sitting on towels on the lawn waving flags. But,\neven so, the main feeling was of people crowding around to see something\nspectacular \u2014 *look, it\u2019s Neil Diamond!*\n\nThe sense was rather different when, wandering past techs and grips, Tim\nDeLaughter, wearing the dingiest of street clothes, climbed over a\nforest of cables to the microphone and begun talking about how his\nfather used to beat him for imitating Neil Diamond. *Look, it\u2019s him!*\nwas thoroughly tempered with *Who is this guy?*\n\n\u201cSo, you know, I would say things like *(Neil Diamond voice:) Please\npass the potatoes! I\u2019m so very hungry!* [pats his stomach] and he\u2019d say\n*Don\u2019t you dare do that again* and bitchslap me [mimes bitchslapping]\nand of course I\u2019d do it again and again.\u201d\n\nAnd so the audience was throughly puzzled by the time he, rather\ncasually, dropped in the line \u201cLet me bring out the band\u201d and the couple\ndozen members wandered out onto the stage, also in street clothes. But\nsoon the lights faded and Tim grabbed the microphone and in a burst of\nlight and music, they launched into a rousing version of \u201cSweet\nCaroline.\u201d\n\nTim pranced on stage like no one you\u2019ve ever seen and the audience\nbounced up and down and sung along with enthusiasm, but in a throughly\nconfused manner. No one was quite sure how seriously to take a\ndisheveled-looking bunch of dancers, violinists, trumpeters, and\nharpists led by a guy in street clothes prancing around doing his best\nimitation of Neil Diamond. (Although, God, nothing can top the chorus\ngirls flicking their hair in tune with \u201cLive and Let Die.\u201d)\n\nA rock band is a special kind of spectacle all on its own \u2014 think of\nBeatlesmania, for example, or how \u201crock star\u201d is a generalized term for\na special kind of awe-inspiring celebrity \u2014 and Tim did everything he\ncould to both heighten this sense and demolish it. They\u2019d launch into\nfurious imposing rock songs and the audience would scream and reach\ntoward them, but then the rock would fade down into a quieter symphonic\nbridge section and Tim would sit down on the stage and chat casually\nwith someone in the front row, while still playing the bridge\u2019s main\nrepeating theme on his guitar.\n\nAll the usual audience-musician relations were subverted. Musicians\noften point their mic at the crowd to inspire them to scream the key\nline in a chorus. Tim, in the middle of a verse, would bend down and\npoint the microphone in a fan\u2019s face and let them sing it. And while\nsome musicians \u201cbodysurf\u201d on the crowd\u2019s hands, while he sang about\nbeing \u201cunder the ocean\u201d, Tim literally lay down on the beer-drenched\nsticky floor and crawled between their legs.\n\nThe tension was only heightened in the second act, when the band\nappeared in their famous white robes, but approached the stage by\nwalking through the audience, saying hi to everyone and hugging like old\nfriends. Tim frequently jumped down into the audience and hugged people\nin the middle of singing, the microphone in one hand reaching around\ntheir back to meet his face on the other side.\n\nThe fundamental tension of celebrity is appearing to the world as\nsomeone superhuman \u2014 achiever of great deeds, seen only in airbrushed\nphotos and on giant screens, known by vastly more people than they\nthemselves know \u2014 while still, at base, being a human like everyone\nelse, the kind of person who goes down the street to get a sandwich and\nchats with people on the subway and all the other humdrum pieces of\ndaily life. It\u2019s an odd contradiction and never have I seen it presented\nbetter than watching the Polyphonic Spree on stage last night.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1253257200.0, "postid": "spree", "internal_links": []}, "adlogic": {"post_title": "The Logic of Google Ads", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Logic of Google Ads\n=======================\n\nNovember 3, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/adlogic)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen should you buy ads? Let\u2019s assume your goal is for people to click\non the ads and give you money. (Reasons this may not be true:\npersuasion, brand-building, budget-maximizing.) The return from a block\nof ads is thus revenue - marginal\\_costs - ad\\_costs. Ads are an\ninvestment like any other; you keep buying them until your return on\ninvestment (revenue - marginal\\_costs / ad\\_costs) equals your cost of\ncapital (usually the interest rate).\n\nFor simplicity, we\u2019ll assume your marginal cost is zero. (My marginal\ncost is almost always zero, so this doesn\u2019t strike me as too\nunrealistic.) So how do you estimate revenue? You can track how much\nmoney people who click on your ad give you, but this has two flaws.\nFirst, customers often give you more money over time. Maybe they buy\nlevel one of your video game when they click on the ad, but then they\nmay buy levels two and three the next day after they beat level one. The\nfuture is always in the future, so revenue-per-user numbers may be too\nsmall.\n\nSecond, they might have given you money anyway. Your video game ads\nprobably run on video game review sites, where readers might buy your\ngame just from the review, even if you hadn\u2019t bought an ad. So your\nrevenue numbers may be too big.\n\nBut these problems aren\u2019t so serious. In the first case, the worst that\nhappens is you don\u2019t buy as many ads as you should. In the second, you\ndon\u2019t actually lose money, it\u2019s just that some extra profit you could\nhave kept has gone into ads.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the ad seller. They probably want to maximize how much\nthey charge per ad impression (CPM). (Reasons this may not be true:\nunseemly ads.) A good way to do this is to hold an auction. It\u2019s\nimpractical to have everyone bid live, so Google auctions work like eBay\nauctions: you enter the maximum you\u2019re willing to pay and get charged\njust enough to beat the other bidders. (One can think of this as a\ncomputer-simulated auction where everyone keeps bidding up the price by\npennies until they hit the maximum they\u2019re willing to spend.)\n\nBut what are you bidding on? Ad sellers want to maximize revenue per\nimpression, but ad buyers want to maximize profit per expense. In an\nideal world, ad sellers auction off impressions (this is [what Google Ad\nManager\ndoes](https://www.google.com/support/admanager/publisher/bin/answer.py?answer=79210))\nwhile ad buyers bid per dollar of profit (entering their cost of\ncapital).\n\nDetermining how much profit you make from an ad is hard. Can we just\ntrust you? Let\u2019s say you make \\$2 in profit per 1000 impressions and\neveryone else makes \\$1. Now you can lie and say you make \\$1 in profit\nand then pay twice as much per profit-dollar. Now you pay the same\namount as before, but you win all the profit-dollar auctions. Now that\u2019s\nnot wrong \u2014 you\u2019re clearly making more money than the other bidders, so\nyou should win \u2014 but your bid isn\u2019t cost-per-profit anymore, it\u2019s\ncost-per-impression.\n\nWhat if you paid based on revenue? Verifying revenue is difficult, but\nGoogle could do it if everyone was using Google Checkout. (If you sent\nsome of your users to a non-Google Checkout system, Google could catch\nyou and fine you.) Google offers [nicer\nads](http://checkout.google.com/seller/sales.html) to Checkout users,\nbut they still don\u2019t have much market share, making this system\nimpractical at present.\n\nSome search engines apparently had cost-per-action (CPA) auctions, where\nyou paid based on how many people actually bought things. I have no idea\nhow they made that work, since lying about how many people took an\naction seems really profitable and easy. Maybe that\u2019s why no one does\nthis anymore.\n\nThat just leaves cost-per-click (CPC). Cost-per-click seems ideal, since\nit\u2019s verifiable by both the ad seller (who uses a redirect link to track\nclicks) and the ad buyer (who sees the users show up on their page).\nIt\u2019s a nice half-way point between buyer and seller.\n\nSo the ad seller holds an auction for CPC and multiplies CPC by\nclick-thru-rate (CTR) to calculate CPM. They shows the highest CPM ads,\ncharging each the bidder below them\u2019s CPC, times their relative CTRs.\n(In reality, Google doesn\u2019t just use CTR; they also factor in the\nrelevance of the ad and the quality of the page it goes to.) And, voila:\nwe\u2019ve derived the basics of an online ad system.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis works out great for the ad seller \u2014 they maximize CPM, just like\nthey wanted \u2014 but the ad buyer is still stuck converting their ROI into\nCPC. The ad buyer, recall, wants to increase their spending on ads (now\ndetermined to be CPC) until their return on investment equals their cost\nof capital.\n\nIt seems like this should be pretty easy, and indeed Google does provide\n[tools to calculate\nROI](http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/19390.html), but\napparently not to optimize it. What they do provide is [a\ntool](http://www.google.com/adwords/conversionoptimizer/) to optimize\nyour cost-per-action. **Does anyone know why this is?**\n\nIt seems like an automatic ROI optimizer would lead many people to spend\nmore money on ads. It\u2019s hard to believe Google is leaving all that money\non the table.\n\nBut Google does intelligently optimize the ads themselves. The variance\nin click-thru rates between different ads is huge \u2014 it\u2019s not uncommon to\nsee two very similar ads, but one gets ten times as many clicks as the\nothers. Google lets you put in as many ads as you like and\n[automatically rotates\nthem](http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?answer=112876),\nshowing ads with better CTRs more often.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo far we\u2019ve just had a single ad seller. In the real world, lots of\npeople want to sell ads and lots of people want to buy them. How do you\nmatch them up?\n\nOne option is make the buyer choose. This is how Google Search works:\nGoogle holds an auction for each search query and buyers pick which ones\nthey want to compete in. Another is to group related websites together\nand run ads evenly across all of them. This is how most smaller ad\nnetworks work. And then there\u2019s AdSense. AdSense scans a page for\nrelevant keywords, then runs the Google Search ads that won auctions for\nthose keywords.\n\nGoogle also knows a lot about ad *viewers*. By tracking what web pages\nyou visit, they know [what topics you\u2019re interested\nin](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences). I\u2019m apparently interested in\nUnix, the environment, elections, government, and social science, so\nGoogle prefers to show ads on those subjects to me.\n\n**But there\u2019s another way to think about ad matching:** as a giant\noptimization problem. Which combinations of user, ad placement, and\nadvertisement optimize click-thru rates (or, ultimately, ROI)?\n\nFor each of these, there are lots of variables. For each user, you know\ntheir history, geographical location, computer (browser, operating\nsystem, screen size), ISP, etc. For each ad placement, you know time of\nday, hosting website, page content, etc. And for each ad, there are\nnumerous possible variations in phrasing and design that can be tested,\nas mentioned before.\n\nThe possible combinations are infinite. You can\u2019t test all of them, so\nyou need to come up with ones that are plausible. You can look at which\ncombinations worked in the past: has this ad done significantly better\nin some cities than others, or at some times than others? And you can\nlook for patterns across ads: do ads that do well on CNN also do well on\nMSNBC? These hypotheses can then be tested and, if they work, you start\nrunning ads more there.\n\nNetflix claims they\u2019ve made millions from slight improvements in their\nmovie recommendations.^[1](#fn:n)^ When they offered a prize for more,\nresearchers found thousands of tiny patterns and came up with all sorts\nof innovative algorithms to try to get an edge. After 32 months,\nresearchers doubled the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nImagine how much more is at stake for Google. Last year, they received\n\\$21 *billion* in ad revenue, of which 60% was apparently profit. Even\ntiny improvements would be worth the highest salaries \u2014 a 0.004%\nimprovement would make \\$500,000. Doubling it would create unspeakable\nwealth.\n\nYet Google has no contest for improving ad click-thru rates. Indeed,\npress reports suggest they don\u2019t even have an internal team working on\nit. The AdWords user-interface (recently redesigned from jaw-droppingly\nwretched to just wretched) would seem to suggest they don\u2019t do this kind\nof optimization at all. Their blog asks people to [optimize things\nmanually](http://adwords.blogspot.com/2008/09/where-are-your-clicks-coming-from.html).\nNo doubt there are some things humans (even ad purchase reps) can do\nbetter than computers, but surely there\u2019s a lot more they can do\ntogether \u2014 with humans giving the machine additional hints and\nhypotheses to test.

What if you\nwere willing to take just 10%? You could give ad sellers a slightly\nhigher CPM \u2014 they\u2019d gladly run your ads when they paid more and Google\u2019s\nthe rest of the time. Then you can offer ad buyers a slightly lower CPC.\nAs long as the money people made was more than the cost of setting\nthings up, they\u2019d switch. I\u2019m actually not sure why this hasn\u2019t\nhappened.\n\nNow imagine that you were a genius CS student who could come up with a\nbetter ad optimization algorithm. Your system would have a higher\noverall CTR, since it presented users with better ads. This means that,\nagain, you can pay higher CPMs (since more people click per impression).\nAnd you can redirect some of the money you would spend on higher CPMs\ninto lower CPCs, to attract advertisers.\n\nBut to develop the algorithms and do the optimization you need the data.\nLots of it \u2014 lots of users, lots of advertisers, lots of ad spots. No\nstartup will ever have that; it\u2019s only left to Google (or whichever\ngiant eventually replaces them).\n\nI\u2019m not normally one to be too concerned about improving Google\u2019s bottom\nline (they seem to be doing alright), but as an ad buyer I\u2019m frustrated\nI have to do this work myself.

A productivity\napplication has two jobs: remembering everything you need to do and\ngetting you to do it. The second is necessary because without it, you\u2019ll\nput all your tasks in the application and then never do them. The first\nis necessary because otherwise the application will have no idea what to\ntell you to do.\n\nI think the ideal piece of productivity software would be like having a\ngreat assistant or a campaign manager: someone who intimately knows all\naspects of your life\u2019s todo lists and schedules and wasn\u2019t afraid of\nsaying you had to wrap this meeting up because you promised the kids\nyou\u2019d be home at 5 to take them to the game. Judged against this\nstandard, present productivity software is woefully lacking \u2014 it\u2019s\nusually not much more than a glorified todo list.\n\n**Remembering everything:** Most software lets you store the classical\ntodo list items: call Jon back, finish report, buy toy for\nkids.^[1](#fn:fn1)^ Some systems even branch out into vaguer life goal\nstuff: spend time with family, become accomplished novelist, learn more\nabout history. But that\u2019s about it.\n\nBut most people also have tasks in their project management software\n(fix this bug), various calendar-style events (lunch with Jon, catch\nplane), and a vast quantity of email (answer Jon\u2019s question, fix the\nfrobnitz and report back to Bob, etc.) Yet no one seems to have dared to\nintegrate their software with a calendar, email client, or even bug\ntracking software.\n\nSince it\u2019s unlikely anyone writing productivity software is also going\nto write an email client, a calendar, and a bug tracker (although it\nwould be nice), I\u2019ll settle for having support for plugins that import\ntasks and events from these various other apps. It has to be very simple\nto upload your whole life to your todo app.\n\n**Getting you to do stuff:** The best I\u2019ve seen is some kind of\nfiltering in which the software lets you only look at tasks that can be\ndone in 5 minutes while on a train. But if you\u2019re the kind of person\nwho\u2019s dysfunctional enough to need productivity software, simply having\na big list of tasks probably isn\u2019t going to help you much. (I can write\na big list of tasks in Notepad.) Instead, the software should be\nproactive about getting you to do stuff, like telling you to quit\ngoofing off and get ready for that big deadline you have tomorrow or to\nhurry up and answer that urgent email from yesterday.\n\nHow does it do this? First, it needs to know what\u2019s important. After you\nimport your life it should let you walk through and triage it all: look\nat each one and decide how important it is (or whether it\u2019s already\ndone). I\u2019ve written a program to do this just for my mail and it\u2019s been\ninvaluable \u2014 within a couple hours a morass of three thousand messages\nturned into a neatly labeled set of piles ordered by importance.\nSimilarly, it can turn a tall pile of assorted todos into the beginnings\nof an action plan.\n\nThen comes the crucial part: it tells you what to do. I\u2019m not demanding\nanything fancy, like a robot dog that follows you around and barks\norders (although that might be nice). I\u2019m just saying provide a little\npop-up window with a suggested next task. Psychologically, it\u2019s easy to\nignore a long todo list. In fact, long todo lists are depressing and\nmake you want to look away. But a simple suggestion about one particular\nthing to do next is much harder to dismiss.\n\nOf course, the suggestions have to be good. The software would generate\nthem by taking into account everything it knows about your tasks and\ncalendar today. And if you still don\u2019t like the suggestion, you tell the\nprogram you can\u2019t do it because\u2026:\n\n-   that\u2019ll take too long (adds a time estimate to the task; used to\n    make sure the task can be done before the next event on the\n    calendar)\n-   that\u2019s not very important (adds a priority to the task; used to sort\n    by importance)\n-   I can\u2019t do that here (adds a physical context to the task, like\n    being in a certain place; used to find tasks you can do in your\n    current context)\n-   I can\u2019t do that yet (adds a dependency; dependencies can then be\n    checked occasionally to see if they\u2019ve been finished yet)\n-   I already did that (marks as done)\n-   that\u2019s not due for a while (adds a due date; used to make sure\n    things get done before their deadlines)\n\nand so on. Ideally, the system would be well-informed and smart enough\nthat you could trust its predictions. But even if it wasn\u2019t perfect,\njust suggesting tasks in order of priority would likely be a vast\nimprovement over the whimsical system used by most people in need of\nproductivity software. It\u2019s hard to imagine such a tool wouldn\u2019t be a\ngodsend.\n\n*Aaron Swartz has too large of a todo list to write this program by\nhimself, but if you\u2019re interested in working on it he\u2019d love to help.\nEmail him at [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com)*\n\n(**Postscript:** Dearest readers, telling me that your favorite\nglorified todo list has an API that allows me write all the importers I\nwant as well as write the task suggestion system I described is not an\nanswer. My point is that todo lists should *have* these features; not\nthat they should allow me to write them.)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Or maybe they just don\u2019t know what\nthey\u2019re talking about. Either way, you shouldn\u2019t listen to them. But how\ncan you tell? Here\u2019s a guidebook of key phrases that indicate someone\ndoesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about when they talk about the\neconomy:\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Creates/destroys jobs.** You often hear men of business saying that\ntheir company \u201ccreated\u201d 2000 new jobs. And in some sense that may be\ntrue, but it\u2019s probably less exciting if it turned out that they did it\nby destroying 2000 jobs somewhere else.\n\nThe same is true for economic policy in general; it will typically\ncreate jobs in one place, but only at the expense of losing them\nsomewhere else. That\u2019s because the number of jobs (i.e. the unemployment\nrate) isn\u2019t just a free-floating fact of life; it\u2019s specifically\ncontrolled by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is a cadre of bankers and economists that, among\nother things, meets regularly to decide interest rates. When there are\ntoo few jobs, they lower interest rates, making it easier for people to\nborrow money and start new companies, hiring new people and creating\njobs. (The current crisis is the rare exception \u2014 interest rates are at\nzero and there still aren\u2019t enough jobs. Thus the stimulus package.)\nWhen there are too many jobs, they raise interest rates, making it\nharder for businesses to start and expand, and cutting back on jobs.\n\nWait, too many jobs? The Federal Reserve worries that if unemployment\ngets too low, we\u2019ll hit a cycle of accelerating inflation where prices\nspiral up and up. [Critics\nargue](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/predatorstate) that they actually\ndon\u2019t like low unemployment because then businesses have to compete for\nemployees, which means they have to pay more and give out nicer\nbenefits. So, critics argue, they try to leave some unemployment, so\nthat *employees* are competing and can be pushed into taking lower\nwages.\n\nIf you really care about how many jobs there are \u2014 and obviously you\nshould \u2014 then you shouldn\u2019t worry about particular policies or people,\nwhose effects either won\u2019t matter or will be counteracted by the Fed.\nYou should worry about the Fed and who controls it.\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Helps/hurts competitiveness.** Let\u2019s face facts: America isn\u2019t\ncompeting with anyone. Remember competition? You sell a widget for \\$5;\nI come along and sell it for \\$4; then you have to either lower your\nprice or lose all your customers to me and go bankrupt.\n\nBut America isn\u2019t going to go bankrupt. Countries don\u2019t really do that\nsort of thing.\n\nInstead, what matters for how well a country is doing is (roughly\nspeaking) its productivity, i.e. how much stuff it makes per person-hour\nof work. Sometimes you can increase this productivity by working with\nother countries \u2014 by, for example, trading some steel for some coffee.\nBut this is just a way to up your own country\u2019s productivity; it has\nnothing to do with competition.\n\nThe competitiveness bogeyman is often trotted out when someone is trying\nto get you to do something you don\u2019t want. \u201cOh, sure,\u201d they say, \u201cyou\nmay not want to do it, but the Chinese are and they\u2019re going to eat your\nlunch.\u201d It just isn\u2019t so. Nothing will stop us from chugging along,\neating our lunch just fine; even if the Chinese are eating two lunches.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSadly, a lot of \u201ceconomic commentators\u201d don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking\nabout, so you see these phrases *everywhere*.

Politics, on the other hand, is seen as the\nplace for sleazy and corrupt jerks who lie to us in everything they do\nand try to make everything fit their existing worldviews. So is it any\nsurprise that when the two things meet we\u2019re in for a show?\n\nJournalist Chris Mooney has made a name for himself by writing magazine\narticles that make this intersection, especially under the Bush\nadministration, entertaining. He\u2019s recently released his first book,\n*The Republican War on Science*, which tries to combine the various\nindividual stories into a damning case of science politicization. The\nbook tackles a variety of subjects, including:\n\n-   global warming\n-   nutrition guidelines\n-   fishing regulations\n-   evolution\n-   embryonic stem cells\n-   safe sex\n\nEach one gets a chapter written in the style of a magazine article\n(indeed, many have been published as magazine articles), opening with an\ninteresting person or event and expanding to show how a group of Bush\nbackers (drawn from major industry and the religious right) have\nconcocted their own psuedoscience in an attempt to spread confusion\nabout the truth, with a particular focus on its effects in Washington,\nwhere Mooney is based. Mooney bookends these stories with some more\ngeneral thoughts about the relations of conservatives and science.\n\nThe book has been something of a surprise success, recently making it\nonto the *New York Times* bestseller list, and Mooney has been busy\ndoing a book tour for it. I went to see him when he spoke just down the\nstreet at Porter Square Books and talked to him a bit afterwards as he\nsigned my copy. The audience was interested and engaged. I suspect a lot\nof it was typical anger at the Bush administration (or \u201cthe neocon\nradicals up in Washington and the media\u201d as the angry sort who call in\nto radio shows and so on always seem to put it), but I think this\nparticular issue strikes at the heart of people\u2019s dislike for the\nadministration: the administration refuses to go along with reality,\neven in its most pure form.\n\nThe book itself is a respectable and highly readable (I went through it\nin a day\u2019s free time) piece of work, although I could not help but feel\na little disappointed. In an apparent attempt to gain respectability,\nMooney adopts a detached journalistic \u2014 almost legalistic \u2014 style. While\nMooney doesn\u2019t pull any punches factually \u2014 he will call a lie a lie and\nrefuses to be pulled into the trap of equating conservative science\nabuses with liberal ones \u2014 such a style lacks the verve of Mooney\u2019s more\nstrident online writing, such as when he wrote about Michael Crichton\u2019s\nglobal warming denialist novel *State of Fear*:\n\n> Let\u2019s face it: Such writing is pure porn for global warming deniers,\n> in much the same way that fictional accounts of UFO abduction skeptics\n> converting into true believers titillate UFO fans. [\u2026] By the book\u2019s\n> end, one can only ask: What planet is Michael Crichton living on?\n> Because this one is clearly getting warmer.\n> ([cite](http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/crichton/))\n\nBy comparison, Mooney\u2019s book-long expos\u00e9 of numerous indidents of Bush\nadministration distortion and dishonesty concludes more like this:\n\n> these considerations all suggest science politicization has reached a\n> nadir with the Bush administration [\u2026] Considered this way, Bush\n> administration abuses and distortions of science come to look more and\n> more like a large-scale political strategy. (241f)\n\nAnd despite Mooney\u2019s attempts at moderation and fairness, he hasn\u2019t won\nany favors from the press. *Publishers Weekly*, in a favorable review,\ncalled it \u201cvery readable, and understandably partisan\u201d while the\n*Washington Post* attacked it as \u201csurprisingly unconvincing\u201d,\n\u201cpolemic[al]\u201d, and \u201ca kind of conspiracy theory\u201d. Since the mainstream\nwas apparently ready to consider the book partisan no matter the style,\nMooney probably would have been better off writing a little more\nstrongly.\n\nBut what about conservative readers? At the book signing, someone asked\nMooney if he thought the book would reach them. Mooney doubted that any\nof the relevant politicians would actually read it. \u2018But, you know,\nmaybe someone will say to them, \u201cThings have gotten so bad that there\u2019s\nnow a book claiming we\u2019re at war with science!\u201d\u2019 he said. \u2018Maybe that\nwill have some effect.\u2019\n\n[image1_gopwar]: image1_gopwar.jpg", "external_links": ["http://www.chriscmooney.com/graphics/GOPWar3.jpg", "http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/crichton/"], "time": 1127545200.0, "postid": "gopwar", "internal_links": []}, "undercoverover": {"post_title": "Is Undercover Over?", "tags": [], "post_content": "Is Undercover Over?\n===================\n\nJune 12, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/undercoverover)\n\n* * * * *\n\nMy latest piece for *Extra!* is now up:\n\n[Is Undercover Over?: Disguise seen as deceit by timid\njournalists](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3391)\n\nIt\u2019s about the rise and fall of undercover journalism.

The latest example of this in\nminiature is the technique known as Ajax, which has become so widespread\nthat it\u2019s often thought that the technique has been around practically\nforever.\n\nIn some ways it has. During the first big stretch of browser innovation,\nNetscape added a feature known as LiveScript, which allowed people to\nput small scripts in web pages so that they could continue to do things\nafter you\u2019d downloaded them. One early example was the Netscape form\nsystem, which would tell you if you\u2019d entered an invalid value for a\nfield as soon as you entered it, instead of after you tried to submit\nthe form to the server.\n\nLiveScript became JavaScript and grew more powerful, leading to a\ntechnique known as Dynamic HTML, which was typically used to make things\nfly around the screen and change around in response to user input. Doing\nanything serious with Dynamic HTML was painful, however, because all the\nmajor browsers implemented its pieces slightly differently.\n\nShortly before web development died out, in early versions of Mozilla,\nNetscape showed a new kind of technique. I don\u2019t think it ever had a\nname, but we could call it Dynamic XML. The most vivid example I\nremember seeing was a mockup of an Amazon.com search result. The webpage\nlooked just like a typical Amazon.com search result page, but instead of\nbeing written in HTML it was a piece of XML data which was then rendered\nfor the user by a piece of JavaScript. The cool part was that this meant\nthe rendering could be changed on the fly \u2014 there were a bunch of\nbuttons that would allow you to sort the books in different ways and\nhave them display using different schemes.\n\nShortly thereafter the bubble burst and web development crashed. Not,\nhowever, before Microsoft added a little-known function call named\nXMLHttpRequest to IE5. Mozilla quickly followed suit and, while nobody I\nknow used it, the function stayed there, just waiting to be taken\nadvantage of.\n\nXMLHttpRequest allowed the JavaScript inside web pages to do something\nthey could never really do before: get more data.^[1](#fn:1)^ Before,\nall the data either had to be sent with the web page. If you wanted more\ndata or new data, you had to grab another web page. The JavaScript\ninside web pages couldn\u2019t talk to the outside world. XMLHttpRequest\nchanged that, allowing web pages to get more data from the server\nwhenever they pleased.\n\nGoogle was apparently the first to realize what a sea change this was.\nWith Gmail and Google Maps, they built applications that took advantage\nof this to provide a user interface that was much more like a web\napplication. (The startup Oddpost, bought by Yahoo, actually predated\nthis but their software was for-pay and so they didn\u2019t receive as much\nattention.)\n\nWith Gmail, for example, the application is continually asking the\nserver if there\u2019s new email. If there is, then it live updates the page,\nit doesn\u2019t make you download a new one. And Google Maps lets you drag a\nmap around and, as you do so, automatically downloads the parts of it\nyou want to look at inline, without making you wait for a whole new page\nto download.\n\nJesse James Garrett of Adaptive Path described this new tactic as Ajax\n(Asynchronous Javascript And XML) [in an\nessay](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php)\nand the term immediately took off. Everyone began using the technique in\ntheir own software and JavaScript toolkits sprung up to make doing so\neven easier.\n\nAnd the rest is future history.\n\nBoth systems were relatively ill-supported by browsers in my experience.\nThey were, after all, hacks. So while they both seemed extremely cool\n(KnowNow, in particular, had an awesome demo that allowed for a WYSIWYG\nSubEthaEdit-style live collaboration session in a browser), they never\nreally took off.\n\nNow apparently there is another technique, which I was unaware of, that\n[involved changing the URL of an\niframe](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html) to\nload new JavaScript. I\u2019m not sure why this technique didn\u2019t quite take\noff. While Google Maps apparently used it (and Oddpost probably did as\nwell), I don\u2019t know of any other major users.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  As my commenters point out \u2014 and as I well knew, but momentarily\n    forgotten \u2014 this isn\u2019t really true. Before XMLHttpRequest, people\n    used a trick of not closing the connection to the server. The server\n    would keep adding more and more to the page, never saying it had\n    finished downloading. Ka-Ping Yee used this technique to make a\n    [real-time chat system](http://zesty.ca/chat/) based on an animated\n    GIF. And the ill-fated startup KnowNow used a similar technique with\n    JavaScript to allow for live-updating pages.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:1)\n\n\n", "external_links": ["#fn:1", "http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php", "http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html", "http://zesty.ca/chat/", "#fnref:1"], "time": 1135238400.0, "postid": "ajaxhistory", "internal_links": []}, "shifting5": {"post_title": "Saving Business: The Origins of Right-Wing Think Tanks", "tags": ["politics"], "post_content": "Saving Business: The Origins of Right-Wing Think Tanks\n======================================================\n\nJune 10, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting5)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*[This is part 5 of an article on the power of right-wing think tanks.\nSee also [part one](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1), [part\ntwo](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2), [part\nthree](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3), and [part\nfour](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4).]*\n\nSince the goal of these think tanks clearly isn\u2019t to advance knowledge,\nwhat are they for?

The boards of\ntrustees \u2026 overwhelmingly are composed of men and women who are leaders\nin the system.\u201d And the media \u201care owned and theoretically controlled by\ncorporations which depend upon profits, and the enterprise system to\nsurvive.\u201d So business must \u201cconduct guerilla warfare\u201d by \u201cestablishing a\nstaff of highly qualified scholars\u201d who can be paid to publish a \u201csteady\nflow of scholarly articles\u201d in magazines and journals as well as books\nand pamphlets to be published \u201cat airports, drugstores, and\nelsewhere.\u201d[\u2020](http://reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate_accountability/powell_memo_lewis.html)\n\nWilliam Simon, president of the right-wing Olin Foundation (the same one\nthat later funded Brock) was more blunt: \u201cThe only thing that can save\nthe Republican Party \u2026 is a counter-intelligentsia. \u2026 [Conservative\nscholars] must be given grants, grants, and more grants in exchange for\nbooks, books, and more books.\u201d (*Blinded By the Right*, 78)\n\nThe Powell memo was incredibly influential. Soon after it was written,\nbusiness began following its advice, building up its network of think\ntanks, news outlets, and media pressure groups. These organizations\nbegun to dot the landscape, hiding behind respectable names like the\nManhattan Institute or the Heartland Foundation. While these\ninstitutions were all funded by partisan conservatives, news accounts\nrarely noted this fact. (Another FAIR study finds The Heritage\nFoundation\u2019s political orientation \u2014 let alone its funding \u2014 was only\nidentified in 24% of news\ncitations.)[\u2020](http://www.fair.org/extra/9805/think-tanks.html)\n\nAs the conservative message machine grew stronger, political debate and\nelectoral results begun to shift further and further to the right,\neventually allowing extreme conservatives to be elected, first with\nRonald Reagan and now with George W. Bush. More recently, conservatives\nhave managed to finally win not only the White House but both houses of\nCongress. While their policy proposals, when understood, are just as\nunpopular as ever, conservatives are able to use their media power to\ntwist the debate.\n\n*Next:* [Part 6: Hurting Seniors](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting6)\n", "external_links": ["http://reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate_accountability/powell_memo_lewis.html", "http://www.fair.org/extra/9805/think-tanks.html"], "time": 1149922800.0, "postid": "shifting5", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting1", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting2", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting3", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting4", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/shifting6"]}, "perfectinstitutions": {"post_title": "Perfect Institutions", "tags": [], "post_content": "Perfect Institutions\n====================\n\nJune 8, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/perfectinstitutions)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn pretty much every major city in this country, there\u2019s a Hollister Co.\nclothing store \u2014 there are over 500 of them in all. Walk inside and it\u2019s\nlike being transported: the windows are shuttered so they control the\nlight, the entrance has an L-shaped route so that you don\u2019t catch a hint\nof the outside world, the floors and ceilings have been replaced with\nnew patterns, thumping music controls the sound, special scents are\npumped into the air to control what you smell. An attractive young\nperson greets you at the door. You\u2019re in a different world.\n\nAnd, to a first approximation, this new world is perfect. Sure, if you\nsearch hard, maybe you can find a ruffled edge on a shirt somewhere, but\nit\u2019s hardly enough to spoil the illusion. And this is what strikes me:\nthat in every major city, in this deeply-flawed country, you can find a\nlittle bit of perfection.\n\nNo one person, I am sure, can accomplish this kind of perfection. Think\nabout yourself being responsible for creating such a place. Surely\nthere\u2019s some part of it you\u2019re not capable of doing \u2014 do you know where\nto find the perfect music and the perfect scent and someone to tile the\nceiling and someone to take a perfect photograph for the wall and on and\non? And even if you are that kind of heroic generalist, who can handle\nall of that, could you maintain it without flagging, day after day,\nwithout loosening your standards, without giving in to the exhaustion\nthat maintaining such a perfect appearance takes? OK, perhaps you have\nmore willpower than I \u2014 but unless you\u2019re Amy Goodman, even you must\ntake ill sometimes, must have a family emergency to attend to, or\n*something*! Nobody\u2019s perfect, right?\n\nAnd yet, here they are, five hundred stores of perfection. (You may\ndetest what they are perfect at, but that\u2019s not my point. The point is\nthat they have a vision and make it stick.) How do they do it?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d you say. \u201cThey don\u2019t just have one person \u2014 they have a\nwhole bunch. When one falls down on the job, or skips out sick, the\nothers pick up the slack.\u201d But those others are imperfect too. It seems\nfar from preordained that a bunch of imperfection combines to create the\nperfect \u2014 it seems just as plausible that combining imperfect people\ncauses the imperfections to multiply, that the whole is far less than\nthe sum of its parts (I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all been in such situations).\n\nThe difference between these two fates \u2014 between people\u2019s imperfections\ncanceling each other out versus amplifying each other \u2014 is institutions,\nthe social structures that guide people in their actions. Hollister\nseems gifted with an amazing set of institutions. I don\u2019t know the\ndetails, but we can imagine them: Everyone must show up for their shift\nan hour early. If you don\u2019t show, a manager calls in a replacement. The\nmanagers keep an eye on your performance and if you don\u2019t do a good\nenough job folding shirts, you\u2019re reprimanded or replaced. Perhaps a\nroving \u201cbrand protection squad\u201d goes around ensuring local managers are\nupholding the high national standards. And on and on. Every failsafe has\na failsafe.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried building an organization yourself, you know how\nhard it is to get something like this right. And yet the world is filled\nwith organizations that seem to do it effortlessly. This is the paradox\n[at the heart of Kafka\u2019s *The\nTrial*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011) and it\u2019s one that\ncontinues to astonish me. How do they do it?

They\nfilled up all the planes in and out and took over both universities, and\nused it all to build a giant party.\n\nSigns and arrows pointed every direction, each former classroom\ncommandeered for a discussion on some new topic. Kids posed for tourist\nphotos by the welcome sign featuring the Forum\u2019s slogan: \u201cAnother world\nis possible.\u201d Possible, but not present.

Let\u2019s say, for\nexample, they notice that there\u2019s a tiny hole where the \u201cmath center\u201d of\nthe brain should be. No wonder they do worse at math!\n\nNo doubt, *The Times* would respond with [a handwringing\narticle](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003894.html)\nabout the important scientific implications and David Brooks would\n[throw a\nparty](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003246.html)\nand denounce closed-minded liberals. George Bush would cancel programs\naimed at helping girls learn math and Harvard University would shut down\ntheir task force on getting women tenure.\n\nBut are these really appropriate responses? Showing genetic differences\nis only the first in a long line of things that need to be shown to\nprove that gender-based disparities in tenure are unavoidable. [As\nJeremy\nFreese](http://jeremyfreese.blogspot.com/2006/11/twenty-four-stories-of-internal.html)\nhas pointed out, it\u2019s a long line from genes to social outcomes. To make\nthe case, you need to go a lot further.\n\n**Second,** you have to show the genetic differences are relevant. It\u2019s\npossible the hole in the math center could be completely insignificant,\nthat women do just as well at math irrespective. So you need to show\nthat the hole *causes* differences in functioning. One way to do this is\nto find different people with differing sizes of holes, control for as\nmany other factors as possible, and see if the size of hole is\ncorrelated with some test of math functioning.\n\n**Third,** you need to prove that the differences are unavoidable. The\nbrain has amazing levels of neuroplasticity. Perhaps with the right\nenvironment, women can be taught to do math with another part of their\nbrain. Perhaps, as a result, they might even do *better* than men at\nmath. Again, [Freese has pointed\nout](http://jeremyfreese.blogspot.com/2006/11/eight-plots-revised.html)\nthat the same genetic differences (or genetic similarities) can go all\nsorts of different places in different environments. If there\u2019s an easy\nenvironmental change that makes even genetically different women equally\ngood at math, we ought to make it.\n\n**Fourth,** you need to show a causal link from the genetic difference\nto the tenure disparity. Why is it that doing worse at math causes you\nto do worse at tenure? Are speed-math-tests used as a relevant factor in\ntenure decisions? If so, maybe you guys should really cut that out,\nbecause that\u2019s a pretty stupid test.\n\n**Fifth,** you need to show that it\u2019s the only cause of discrimination.\nEven if genetic differences cause some of the disparity, it\u2019s still\nmorally required for us to remove the rest. Do guys with holes in their\nmath center do just as bad as women at getting tenure? Do women with no\nholes do just as well as men?\n\nRight now, there\u2019s only even arguable evidence for the very first of\nthese.

The most famous\nexample is the Semantic Web project (where, in full disclosure, I worked\nfor several years). The project, spearheaded by Tim Berners-Lee,\ninventor of the Web, proposed to extend the working model of the Web to\nmore structured data, so that instead of simply publishing text web\npages, users could publish their own databases, which could be\naggregated by search engines like Google into major resources.\n\nThe Semantic Web project has received an enormous amount of criticism,\nmuch (in my view) rooted in misunderstandings, but much legitimate as\nwell. In the news today is just the most recent example, in which famed\ncomputer scientist turned Google executive [Peter Norvig challenged Tim\nBerners-Lee](http://news.com.com/Google+exec+challenges+Berners-Lee/2100-1025_3-6095705.html)\non the subject at a conference.\n\nThe confrontation symbolizes the (at least imagined) standard debate on\nthe subject, which Mark Pilgrim termed [million dollar markup versus\nmillion dollar\ncode](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29/million_dollar_markup).\nBerners-Lee\u2019s W3C, the supposed proponent of million dollar markup,\nargues that users should publish documents that state in special\nlanguages that computers can process exactly what they want to say.\nMeanwhile Google, the supposed proponent of million dollar code, thinks\nthis is an impractical fantasy, and that the only way forward is to\nwrite more advanced software to try to extract the meaning from the\nmesses that users will inevitably create.[\\^1]\n\n[\\^1]: I say supposed because although this is typically how the debate\nis seen, I don\u2019t think either the W3C or Google actually hold the strict\npositions on the subject typically ascribed to them. Nonetheless, the\nquestion is real and it\u2019s convenient to consider the strongest forms of\nthe positions.\n\nBut yesterday I suggested what might be thought of as a third way out;\none Pilgrim might call million dollar users. Both the code and the\nmarkup positions make the assumption that users will be publishing their\nown work on their own websites and thus we\u2019ll need some way of\nreconciling it. But Wikipedia points to a different model, where all the\nusers come to *one* website, where the interface for inputting data in\nthe proper format is clear and unambiguous, and the users can work\ntogether to resolve any conflicts that may come up.\n\nIndeed, this method strikes me as so superior that I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t\nsee it discussed in this context more often. Ignorance doesn\u2019t seem\nplausible; even if Wikipedia was a late-comer, sites like\n[ChefMoz](http://chefmoz.org/) and\n[MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) followed this model and were\nSemantic Web case studies. (Full disclosure: I worked on the Semantic\nWeb portions of MusicBrainz.) Perhaps the reason is simply that both\nsides \u2014 W3C and Google \u2014 have the existing Web as the foundation for\ntheir work, so it\u2019s not surprising that they assume future work will\nfollow from the same basic model.\n\nOne possible criticism of the million dollar users proposal is that it\u2019s\nsomehow less free than the individualist approach. One site will end up\nbeing in charge of all the data and thus will be able to control its\nformation. This is perhaps not ideal, certainly, but if the data is made\navailable under a free license it\u2019s no worse than things are now with\nfree software. Those angry with the policies can always exercise their\nright to \u201cfork\u201d the project if they don\u2019t like the direction things are\ngoing. Not ideal, certainly, but we can try to dampen such problems by\nmaking sure the central sites are run as democratically as possible.\n\nAnother argument is that innovation will be hampered: under the\nindividualist model, any person can start doing a new thing with their\ndata, and hope that others will pick up the technique. In the\ncentralized model, users are limited by the functionality of the\ncentralized site. This too can be ameliorated by making the centralized\nsite as open to innovation as possible, but even if it\u2019s closed, other\npeople can still do new things by downloading the data and building\nadditional services on top of it (as indeed [many have done with\nWikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools)).\n\nIt\u2019s been eight years since Tim Berners-Lee published his [Semantic Web\nRoadmap](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html) and it\u2019s\ndifficult to deny that things aren\u2019t exactly going as planned. Actual\nadoption of Semantic Web technologies has been negligible and nothing\nthat promises to change that appears on the horizon. Meanwhile, the\nmillion dollar code people have not fared much better. Google has been\nable to launch a handful of very targeted features, like [music\nsearch](http://www.google.com/musicsearch?q=google) and [answers to very\nspecific kinds of\nquestions](http://www.google.com/search?q=when+was+tim+berners-lee+born%3F)\nbut these are mere conveniences, far from changing the way we use the\nWeb.\n\nBy contrast, Wikipedia has seen explosive growth, Amazon.com has become\nthe premier site for product information, and when people these days\ntalk about user-generated content, they don\u2019t even consider the\nindividualized sense that the W3C and Google assume. Perhaps it\u2019s time\nto try the third way out.\n", "external_links": ["http://news.com.com/Google+exec+challenges+Berners-Lee/2100-1025_3-6095705.html", "http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29/million_dollar_markup", "http://chefmoz.org/", "http://musicbrainz.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools", "http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html", "http://www.google.com/musicsearch?q=google", "http://www.google.com/search?q=when+was+tim+berners-lee+born%3F"], "time": 1153292400.0, "postid": "masscollab2", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/masscollab"]}, "geremiah": {"post_title": "Cherish mistakes", "tags": [], "post_content": "Cherish mistakes\n================\n\nSeptember 17, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/geremiah)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*This post is part six of the series [Raw\nNerve](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).*\n\nThis is a tale of two nonprofits.\n\nAt one, they hate making mistakes. How else could it be? \u201cWe\u2019re not ever\ngoing to enjoy screwing up,\u201d they told me. But this attitude has a lot\nof consequences. Everything they do has to go through several layers of\napproval to make sure it\u2019s not a mistake. And when someone does screw\nup, they try to hide it.\n\nIt\u2019s only natural \u2014 you know you\u2019re going to get in trouble for screwing\nup, so you try to fix it before anyone notices. And if you can\u2019t do,\nthen your boss or your boss\u2019s boss tries. And if no one in the\norganization can fix it, and it goes all the way to the executive\ndirector, then he tries to figure out a way to keep it from the press or\nspin it appropriately, so the world never finds out they made a mistake.\n\nAt the other nonprofit, they have a very different attitude. You notice\nit the first time you visit their website. Right in their navigation\nbar, at the top of every page, is a link labeled \u201cMistakes.\u201d Click it\nand you\u2019ll find a list of all the things they screwed up, starting with\nthe most horribly embarrassing one (they once promoted their group under\nfalse names).\n\nAnd it goes on to discuss mistakes big and small, core and peripheral.\nThey previously used flaky phones that would cut out during a call,\nannoying people. They were insufficiently skeptical in some of the most\nimportant claims they made. At times, their admissions have the tone of\na chastised teenager forced to write an apology, but together they\nprovide a remarkable record of all the mistakes, both crucial and\nmundane, you might reasonably make when starting something new.\n\nIt\u2019s not that this group likes making mistakes \u2014 you can feel the\nannoyance and embarrassment seeping through the page \u2014 but they don\u2019t\nshirk from them either. They identify their mistake, admit them\npublicly, and devise steps to avoid them next time. They use it as an\nopportunity to get better.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI [wrote before](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) about Carol\nDweck\u2019s studies of successful and unsuccessful kids, but there\u2019s one bit\nthat really jumped out at me. Given a really tough puzzle to solve, one\ngrowth mindset kid just smiles and says \u201cMistakes are our\nfriend.\u201d^[1](#fn:d2)^\n\n*Mistakes are our friend.* They can be an exasperating friend sometimes,\nthe kind whose antics embarrass and annoy, but their heart is in the\nright place: they want to help. It\u2019s a bad idea to ignore our friends.\n\nThat\u2019s a hard attitude to take toward mistakes \u2014 they\u2019re so\nembarrassing, our natural instinct is to want to hide them and cover\nthem up. But that\u2019s the wrong way to think about them. They\u2019re actually\ngiving us a gift, because they\u2019re pointing the way toward getting\nbetter.\n\nIf we try to ignore them, they\u2019ll keep nagging at us. We\u2019ll run into\nthem again and again in different guises. You\u2019ll say \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\nthat wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 I meant to do that.\u201d And then you\u2019ll eagerly do\nthe same thing next time ([cognitive dissonance\nagain](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)). Or else you\u2019ll say\n\u201cYes, yes, of course that was a mistake \u2014 it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d But as\nyou hurry to move on, you don\u2019t change anything, and so it does happen\nagain.\n\nThe trick is to confront the mistake, fess up to what went wrong, and\nthink about what you can change to keep it from happening again. Usually\njust promising not to do it again is not enough: you need to dig into\nthe root causes and address those.\n\nSakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota car company, developed a\ntechnique called \u201cFive Why\u2019s\u201d for handling this. For example, sometimes\na car would come off the Toyota production line and not start. Why?\nWell, imagine it was because the alternator belt had come loose. Most\ncar companies would stop here and just fix the alternator belt. But\nToyoda understood that was dodging the mistake \u2014 it would just lead it\nto come back again and again. So he insisted they keep asking \u201cWhy?\u201d.\n\nWhy was the alternator belt loose? Because it hadn\u2019t been put on\ncorrectly. Why? Because the person putting it on didn\u2019t double-check to\nsee if it had fit in correctly. Why? Because he was in too much of a\nhurry. Why? Because he had to walk all the way to the other side of the\nline to get the belts and by the time he got back he didn\u2019t have enough\ntime to double-check.\n\nAha! There, on the fifth why, we find the real cause of the mistake. And\nthe solution is easy: move the box of alternator belts closer. But if\nwe\u2019d stopped at any earlier point (say, by just yelling at the\nalternator belt guy to always remember to double-check), we wouldn\u2019t\nhave actually fixed the problem. The same mistake would have happened\nagain and again. Only by digging all the way to the root cause did we\nrealize we needed to move the box of belts. The mistake pointed the way\nto the solution.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe last time I wrote about two nonprofits, someone commented to say\nthey were \u201coutright nauseated\u201d by my post. \u201c[T]he website is not the\nplace to signal humility and argue against your own conclusions. All\nthat would demonstrate is naivety and incompetence,\u201d they insisted. And\nmaybe they\u2019re right: maybe having a mistakes page at the top of your\nwebsite goes much too far.\n\nI\u2019ve [written before](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis) why I\ndisagree, but even if they\u2019re right that you shouldn\u2019t tell the world\nabout your mistakes, you need to at least tell yourself. It\u2019s much too\neasy to conveniently forget about all the stuff you screwed up. And so\neven though it happens again and again, you never notice the pattern.\n\nBy forcing yourself to write it down, to keep a log of the problems\nyou\u2019ve run into, you begin to see patterns. You start seeing the things\nyou get better at and the things you keep flubbing. And then you know\nwhat to work on for next time.\n\n**Next in this series:** [Fix the machine, not the\nperson](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/nummi)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

And then only to those with\nnotice. And then only to those published with notice that were deposited\nand registered promptly. And to those [published,] marked, deposited,\nand registered, the copyright still had to be renewed after 28 years.\nUnder this system, nearly fifty percent of published work entered the\npublic domain immediately and ninety-three percent within twenty-eight\nyears.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the 1976 Copyright Act, that all changed and copyright was\ngranted automatically, for a full term, as soon as a work was fixed in a\ntangible form. No longer was it necessary to published, deposit, mark,\nor renew. Copyright moved from an opt-in system to an opt-out. And under\nthis system, zero percent of published work will enter the public domain\nfor at least a hundred years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a radical change \u2014 perhaps the most radical change \u2014 to\ncopyright law, going from ninety-three percent of works going in the\npublic domain to zero. And the result is a huge increase in \u2018orphaned\nworks\u2019 \u2014 works whose copyright holder cannot even be located to ask\npermission.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn *Eldred v. Ashcroft*, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright only\nneeded judicial review when the \u2018traditional contours\u2019 of copyright law\nwere changed. This is clearly a change to copyright\u2019s traditional\ncontours and thus deserves a chance for judicial review.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s lawyer \u2014 slick, but not as slick as Lessig \u2014 argued\nthat the Court was referring to only two traditional contours: the right\nto fair use (which allows things like the use of small snippets of\ncopyrighted material and limited copies for educational use) and the\n\u201cidea/expression dichotomy\u201d (which says that you can\u2019t copyright ideas\nbut only a particular way of expressing them).\n\nLessig responded that this was absurd. If the government ruled that\ncartoons featuring the prophet Mohammed could not receive copyrights,\nthe law would clearly be subject to First Amendment review, even though\nneither fair use nor idea/expression were touched. Similarly, the change\nfrom opt-out to opt-in deserves review.\n\nThere were three judges, as required by law to hear all federal appeals.\nThe one on the right, who was live via satellite, didn\u2019t say a word the\nentire time. The one on the left didn\u2019t ask more than a question or two.\nThe judge in the middle was responsible for most of the questions. And\nshe did not appear to get it.\n\n\u201cHow is this different from *Eldred*?\u201d she asked.\n\nA quarter of the way in to the argument, she handed a slip of paper to\nher aide. Her aide scurried away and came back with a thick document.\nShe looked down at it and then looked up.\n\n\u201cYou were the lawyer in *Eldred* as well,\u201d she asked Lessig.\n\n\u201cYes, your honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is this different from *Eldred*?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn *Eldred*,\u201d Lessig explained, trying again, \u201cthe issue was whether\nCongress could continue expanding the length of copyright in order to\nkeep Mickey Mouse from going into the public domain. The Court \u2014 Justice\nGinsburg channelling Justice Scalia \u2014 said that since Congress had been\ndoing this forever they could keep doing it. But in this case, we\u2019re\ntalking about a new change, one that effects orphaned works \u2014 works for\nwho the copyright holder cannot be located.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t include Mickey Mouse, because every can find Disney?\u201d\nthe judge asked.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Lessig replied.\n\nDuring the government\u2019s rebuttal, the judge asked who was lobbying\nagainst this change in copyright law. \u201cWell,\u201d the government\u2019s lawyer\nreplied, \u201cum, I suspect it was people very much like the ones you see\nhere today.\u201d (\u201cYeah,\u201d Lessig scoffed later, \u201cI was testifying in\nCongress against the bill back when I was fifteen!\u201d)\n\nBy the same token, the judge asked Lessig about what solutions to the\nproblem he would expect were the law ruled unconstitutional. \u201cThere are\nmany possible solutions,\u201d Lessig replied, drawing a picture of a network\nof people fighting this issue in all branches of government. There was\nthis lawsuit, of course, but there was also a bill introduced by local\nCongresswoman Zoe Lofgren to require a one-dollar renewal fee (based,\nLessig did not say, on a *New York Times* op-ed he had written), there\nwas a series of hearings by the U.S. Copyright Office on the orphaned\nworks problem, which concluded \u201cThe orphan works problem is real. \u2026\nLegislation is necessary to provide a meaningful solution to the orphan\nworks problem as we know it today.\u201d and provided several proposals.\n\n\u201cYour time is up,\u201d the judge said, before the red light saying his time\nwas up had gone on, and Lessig quietly packed up his papers and filed\nout, half the courtroom following behind him.\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle (the man who\nLessig is filing this lawsuit on behalf of) said to Lessig, shaking his\nhand and smiling broadly. Lessig smiled back, then posed politely for\nphotos with Kahle and his associate Rick Prelinger. The well-wishers\nsoon streamed out until it was just Lessig and his fellow law school\nlawyers. The smile disappeared from Lessig\u2019s face. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it,\u201d\nLessig said downcast.\n\n\u201cOh, I think they were getting it towards the end there,\u201d one of the\nlawyers said, trying to cheer Lessig up. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cthey\nweren\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d another lawyer chimed in, \u201cto write an opinion they\u2019ll\nhave to read the briefs and then they\u2019ll see your argument.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he\nexplained, \u201cthey can just tell a clerk which way to write the opinion\nand have them do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, our best hope now is that they won\u2019t write an opinion at all\nand then *Golan* [a related case in a different Circuit] will go the\nother way and then we\u2019ll have a circuit split.\u201d (A circuit split is when\ntwo different circuit courts rule different ways on the same issue.\nUsually the Supreme Court then has to step in to resolve the\ndisagreement.)\n\n\u201cWell, at least your case didn\u2019t have any flamethrowers,\u201d someone said,\ntrying to lighten the mood.

Alguien que sea inteligente\npero que no saca el trabajo adelante deber\u00eda ser tu amigo, no tu\nempleado. Puedes hablar sobre tus problemas mientras procastinan\n(posponer conscientemente un trabajo que sabemos que tenemos que hacer)\ncon su trabajo real. Alguien que saca adelante el trabajo pero que no es\ninteligente, es ineficiente: los que no son inteligentes sacan el\ntrabajo adelante usando el camino m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil y trabajar con ellos es\nlento y frustran. Por \u00faltimo, alguien con quien no puedes trabajar\u2026\nbueno, pues no puedes trabajar con \u00e9l.\n\nEl proceso tradicional de contrataci\u00f3n de programadores consiste en: a)\nleer un curriculum, b) realizar algunas preguntas dif\u00edciles en una\nconversaci\u00f3n telef\u00f3nica, y c) darles un problema de programaci\u00f3n en\npersona. Creo que es un sistema horrible para contratar a alguien. Se\npuede aprender muy poco de un curriculum y la gente se pone nerviosa\ncuando les haces preguntas complejas en una entrevista. Programar no es\nel t\u00edpico trabajo que se hace bajo presi\u00f3n, as\u00ed que ver c\u00f3mo se comporta\nalguien cuando est\u00e1 nervioso es bastante in\u00fatil.

Creo que soy un programador bastante bueno, pero\nnunca he superado una de esas entrevistas y dudo que nunca lo pueda\nhacer.\n\nAs\u00ed que cuando tengo que contratar gente, intento responder a las tres\npreguntas [que planteaba al principio]. Para saber si pueden sacar el\ntrabajo adelante, les pregunto qu\u00e9 han hecho. Si de verdad hacen su\ntrabajo, a estas alturas deber\u00edan tener algo ya hecho. Es dif\u00edcil ser\nbuen programador sin alg\u00fan tipo de experiencia previa y en estos d\u00edas\ntodo el mundo puede obtener experiencia colaborando en alg\u00fan proyecto de\nsoftware libre.

Aprendes un mont\u00f3n r\u00e1pidamente,\nporque no les est\u00e1s mirando mientras responden a una compleja pregunta\nde entrevista, sino que est\u00e1s viendo el c\u00f3digo real que han producido.\n\u00bfEs conciso? \u00bfClaro? \u00bfElegante? \u00bfUsable? \u00bfEs algo que querr\u00edas en tu\nproducto?\n\nPara saber si alguien es inteligente, tengo una conversaci\u00f3n informal\ncon ellos. Hago todo lo posible por eliminar la presi\u00f3n: me encuentro\ncon la persona en un caf\u00e9, les digo claramente que no es una entrevista,\nhago todo lo que puedo por ser informal y amigable. Bajo ning\u00fan pretexto\nles hago \u201cpreguntas est\u00e1ndar\u201d de entrevista. Simplemente hablo con ellos\ncomo lo har\u00eda con alguien que conozco en una fiesta. (Si le pides a la\ngente que conoces en una fiesta que enumeren sus puntos fuertes y\nd\u00e9biles o que estimen el n\u00famero de afinadores de piano que hay en\nMadrid, tienes problemas m\u00e1s importantes). Creo que es bastante sencillo\nsaber si alguien es inteligente mientras sostienes una conversaci\u00f3n\ninformal con \u00e9l. Constantemente hago juicios sobre si la gente que estoy\nconociendo es inteligente, de la misma forma que constantemente estoy\nevaluando si la gente que veo me parece atractiva.\n\nPero si tuviera que escribir qu\u00e9 es lo que hace que alguien me parezca\ninteligente, pondr\u00eda el \u00e9nfasis en tres cosas. La primera \u00bftienen\nconocimientos? Preg\u00fantales en qu\u00e9 han estado pensado y comprueba su\nnivel de conocimiento sobre ello. \u00bfParecen comprenderlo al detalle?\n\u00bfPueden explicarlo claramente? (explicaciones claras son un signo de que\nrealmente conocen la materia). \u00bfSaben cosas sobre ese tema que t\u00fa no\nsabes?\n\nSegunda, \u00bfson curiosos? \u00bfResponden haci\u00e9ndote preguntas sobre ti? \u00bfEst\u00e1n\ngenuinamente interesados o simplemente est\u00e1n siendo educados? \u00bfRealizan\npreguntas sobre lo que est\u00e1s diciendo? \u00bfTe hacen pensar sus preguntas?\n\nTercero, \u00bfAprenden? En alg\u00fan punto de la conversaci\u00f3n, probablemente\nacabar\u00e1s explic\u00e1ndole algo. \u00bfLo entienden de verdad o simplemente\nasienten y sonr\u00eden? Hay gente que sabe cosas sobre alguna peque\u00f1a \u00e1rea,\npero no tienen curiosidad con respecto a otras. Y hay gente que es\ncuriosa pero no aprende, realizan muchas preguntas pero en realidad no\nest\u00e1n escuchando. Y yo quiero alguien que cumpla las tres cosas\n[escuchar+preguntar+aprender].\n\nFinalmente, concluyo si puedo trabajar con alguien pasando alg\u00fan tiempo\ncon esa persona. Mucha gente brillante puede parecer agradable en una\nconversaci\u00f3n de una hora, pero sus excentricidades se hacen patentes\ndespu\u00e9s de un par de horas. As\u00ed que, una vez que hayas acabado la\ncharla, inv\u00edtale a comer con el resto del equipo o a jugar a algo en la\noficina. Por supuesto, mantengo las cosas tan informales como sea\nposible. El objetivo es, precisamente, ver si te ponen de los nervios.\n\nSi todo parece correcto y ya me siento preparado para contratar a\nalguien, hago una peque\u00f1a comprobaci\u00f3n final de seguridad para confirmar\nque no me la han dado con queso: les pido que hagan una parte del\ntrabajo. Normalmente, esto supone escoger una parte del proyecto\nsuficientemente independiente y pedir que la escriban (si realmente\nnecesitas ver a alguien trabajando bajo presi\u00f3n, ponles una fecha de\nentrega). Si es necesario, puedes ofrecer pagarles por el trabajo, pero\na la mayor\u00eda de los programadores que me he encontrado no les importa\nque les encargues una tarea peque\u00f1a como esta siempre y cuando puedan\npublicar el c\u00f3digo de su trabajo cuando est\u00e9 acabado. Esta prueba no\nfunciona por ella misma, pero si alguien ha pasado las primeras tres\npartes, deber\u00eda ser suficiente para probar que no te han enga\u00f1ado, y que\nrealmente pueden sacar adelante el trabajo.\n\n(He conocido gente que me dice \u201cPerfecto, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no probamos a\ncontratarte un mes y vemos c\u00f3mo sale? Esto no parece funcionar. Si no\npuedes hacerte una idea despu\u00e9s de encargarle un peque\u00f1o trabajo,\ntambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda pasarte que un mes despu\u00e9s tampoco tuvieras una opini\u00f3n\nclara y has acabado contratando gente que no son suficientemente buenos.\nMejor decir directamente no y equivocarse por el lado de intentar\nconseguir a los m\u00e1s indicados [que acabar con alguien que no da la\ntalla].\n\nEstoy bastante contento con este m\u00e9todo. Cuando me he saltado algunas\npartes, he acabado con contrataciones fallidas que finalmente he tenido\nque deshacer. Pero cuando las he seguido, he conseguido gente que me\ngusta tanto que me siento mal si tengo que dejar de trabajar con ellos.\n\nMe sorprende que en vez de esta perspectiva, haya tantas empresas que\nutilicen unas t\u00e9cnicas tan est\u00fapidas para contratar.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.ipodizados.com/4558/contrato-programadores-aaron-swartz"], "time": 1262160000.0, "postid": "hiring.es", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hiring.en"]}, "anders": {"post_title": "Confront reality", "tags": [], "post_content": "Confront reality\n================\n\nSeptember 9, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/anders)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*This post is part five of the series [Raw\nNerve](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve).*\n\nWe are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and\nthen, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so\nas to show that we were right. Intellectually, it is possible to carry\non this process for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that\nsooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually\non a battlefield.\n\n\u2014George Orwell, \u201c[In Front of Your\nNose](http://orwell.ru/library/articles/nose/english/e_nose)\u201d\n\nIf you want to understand experts, you need to start by finding them. So\nthe psychologists who wanted to understand \u201cexpert performance\u201d began by\ntesting alleged experts, to see how good they really were.\n\nIn some fields it was easy: in chess, for example, great players can\nreliably beat amateurs. But in other fields, it was much, much harder.\n\nTake punditry. In his giant 20-year study of expert forecasting, Philip\nTetlock found that someone who merely predicted \u201ceverything will stay\nthe same\u201d would be right more often than most professional\npundits.^[1](#fn:tet)^ Or take therapy. Numerous studies have found an\nhour with a random stranger is just as good as an hour with a\nprofessional therapist.^[2](#fn:dawes)^ In one study, for example,\nsessions with untrained university professors helped neurotic college\nstudents just as much as sessions with professional\ntherapists.^[3](#fn:strupp)^ (This isn\u2019t to say that therapy isn\u2019t\nhelpful \u2014 the same studies suggest it is \u2014 it\u2019s just that what\u2019s helpful\nis talking over your problems for an hour, not anything about the\ntherapist.)\n\nAs you might expect, pundits and therapists aren\u2019t fans of these\nstudies. The pundits try to weasel out of them. As Tetlock writes; \u201cThe\ntrick is to attach so many qualifiers to your vague predictions that you\nwill be well positioned to explain pretty much whatever happens. China\nwill fissure into regional fiefdoms, but only if the Chinese leadership\nfails to manage certain trade-offs deftly, and only if global economic\ngrowth stalls for a protracted period, and only if\u2026\u201d^[4](#fn:t2)^ The\ntherapists like to point to all the troubled people they\u2019ve helped with\ntheir sophisticated techniques (avoiding the question of whether someone\nunsophisticated could have helped even more). What neither group can do\nis point to clear evidence that what they do works.\n\nCompare them to the chess grandmaster. If you try to tell the chess\ngrandmaster that he\u2019s no better than a random college professor, he can\neasily play a professor and prove you wrong. Every time he plays, he\u2019s\nconfronted with inarguable evidence of success or failure. But\ntherapists can often feel like they\u2019re helping \u2014 they just led their\nclient to a breakthrough about their childhood \u2014 when they\u2019re actually\nnot making any difference.\n\nSynthesizing hundreds of these studies, K. Anders Ericsson concluded\nthat what distinguishes experts from non-experts is engaging in what he\ncalls *deliberate practice*.^[5](#fn:anders)^ Mere practice isn\u2019t enough\n\u2014 you can sit and make predictions all day without getting any better at\nit \u2014 it needs to be a kind of practice where you receive \u201cimmediate\ninformative feedback and knowledge of results.\u201d^[6](#fn:a2)^\n\nIn chess, for example, you pretty quickly discover whether you made a\nsmart move or a disastrous error, and it\u2019s even more obvious in other\nsports (when practicing free-throws, it\u2019s pretty obvious if the ball\nmisses the net). As a result, chess players can try different tactics\nand learn which ones work and which don\u2019t. Our pundit is not so lucky.\nPredicting a wave of revolutions in the next twenty years can feel very\nexciting at the time, but it will be twenty years before you learn\nwhether it was a good idea or not. It\u2019s hard to get much deliberate\npractice on that kind of time frame.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI\u2019ve noticed very ambitious people often fall into this sort of trap.\nAny old slob can predict what will happen tomorrow, they think, but I\nwant to be truly great, so I will pick a much harder challenge: I will\npredict what will happen *in a hundred years*. It comes in lots of\nforms: instead of building another silly site like Instagram, I will\nbuild an *artificial intelligence*; instead of just doing another boring\nexperiment, I will write *a grand work of social theory*.\n\nBut being great isn\u2019t as easy as just picking a hard goal \u2014 in fact,\npicking a really hard goal avoids reality almost as much as picking a\nreally easy one. If you pick an easy goal, you know you\u2019ll always\nsucceed (because it\u2019s so easy); if you pick a really hard one, you know\nyou\u2019ll never fail (because it will always be too early to tell).\nArtificial intelligence is a truly big problem \u2014 how can you possibly\nexpect us to succeed in just a decade? But we\u2019re making great progress,\nwe swear.\n\nThe trick is to set yourself lots of small challenges along the way. If\nyour startup is eventually going to make a million dollars, can it start\nby making ten? If your book is going to eventually persuade the world,\ncan you start by persuading your friends? Instead of pushing all your\ntests for success way off to the indefinite future, see if you can pass\na very small one right now.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important that you test for the right thing. If you\u2019re writing\na program that\u2019s supposed to make people\u2019s lives easier, what\u2019s\nimportant is not whether they like your mockups in focus groups; it\u2019s\nwhether you can make a prototype that actually improves their lives.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the biggest problems in writing self-help books is getting people\nto actually take your advice. It\u2019s not easy to tell a compelling story\nthat changes the way people view their problems, but it turns out to be\na lot easier than writing something that will actually persuade someone\nto get up off the couch and change the way they live their life. There\nare some things writing is really good at, but forcing people to get up\nand do something isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that the books are totally useless unless you\ntake their advice. If you just keep reading them, thinking \u201cthat\u2019s so\ninsightful! that changes everything,\u201d but never actually doing anything\ndifferent, then pretty quickly the feeling will wear off and you\u2019ll\nstart searching for another book to fill the void. Chris Macleod calls\nthis \u201cepiphany addiction\u201d: \u201cEach time they feel like they\u2019ve stumbled on\nsome life changing discovery, feel energized for a bit without going on\nto achieve any real world changes, and then return to their default of\nfeeling lonely and unsatisfied with their life. They always end up back\nat the drawing board of trying to think their way out of their problem,\nand it\u2019s not long before they come up with the latest pseudo earth\nshattering insight.\u201d^[7](#fn:ss)^\n\nDon\u2019t let that happen to you. Go out and test yourself today: pick a\ntask just hard enough that you *might* fail, and try to succeed at it.\nReality is painful \u2014 it\u2019s so much easier to keep doing stuff you know\nyou\u2019re good at or else to pick something so hard there\u2019s no point at\nwhich it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re failing \u2014 but it\u2019s impossible to get better\nwithout confronting it.\n\n**Next in this series:** [Cherish\nmistakes](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/geremiah)\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.

Although he is not a professor himself, McCloud is a theorist\nof comics. Edward Tufte (among countless others) calls his guide\n*Understanding Comics* the best book on the medium. McCloud breaks\ncomics down to its essential: the use of sequential art to tell a story\n\u2014 we see one thing, we see another, we imagine what happens in between.\nAnd watching McCloud speak, I realized that his talk was a vivid form of\ncomics. The images weren\u2019t just illustrations, they drove the story\nalong, with McCloud simply filling in the words to connect them\ntogether.\n\nAfter his talk, someone commented that McCloud\u2019s presentation was the\nbest he\u2019d ever seen. McCloud explained that there are two kinds of\npresentations: \u201cmonkey bars\u201d, where a presenter swings from slide to\nslide, explaining each one in turn, and \u201cmagic carpet rides\u201d, where the\npresenter simply keeps talking, confident the slides will appear\nunderneath him to illustrate a point. McCloud gives a masterful magic\ncarpet ride.\n\nTufte himself is professor emeritus at Yale. These days he goes on tour,\nrock-star style, teaching classes on presenting information. Tufte is a\nbrilliant presenter \u2014 his energy keeps the audience spell-bound for an\nentire day. At one point, as I recall, he jumped up on a table and asked\nus to imagine the information density of various media as charted from\none side of the room to the other. But what, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\nwas the information density of this presentation? After all, hadn\u2019t he\nwritten four books on the subject? (Copies of which are given to each\nparticipant to take home.)\n\nThen there\u2019s Lawrence Lessig, who\u2019s presentations are so powerful and\ninfluential that an entire style of presentation has been named after\nhim. At his peak, I saw him give a talk at the O\u2019Reilly Open Source\nConference that had the audience, as Wes Felter put it, looking to start\na riot afterwards. Lessig\u2019s rhythmic, almost hypnotic, presentation,\ninvariably blows people away.\n\nDoes these people\u2019s talks communicate more information than their books?\nI doubt it. But does a comic book communicate more information than a\nnovel? No way. And yet McCloud (and Tufte) endorse it anyway. It\u2019s not\nbecause of the medium\u2019s informational density, it\u2019s because of its\n*emotional density*. The same is true of these presentations.\n\nReading Lessig\u2019s books, you\u2019ll probably learn more about the history of\ncopyright law and the other things he discusses in his talk. But you\nwon\u2019t feel his righteous indignation against those \u201cextremists on the\nright and left\u201d who are trying to distort its intentions and, in the\nprocess, hurt our culture.\n\nWriting is quite effective at communicating facts, but to become a\nprofessional you need much more than a vast store of facts; you need to\nlearn ways of thinking. These are what lectures, at their best, can\nprovide. They show you how the speakers think about problems, how they\nfeel about them, and, in doing so, provide a more fleshed-out notion\nthan writing ever could.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1159945200.0, "postid": "greatlectures", "internal_links": []}, "whateverittakes": {"post_title": "Whatever It Takes?", "tags": [], "post_content": "Whatever It Takes?\n==================\n\nNovember 1, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whateverittakes)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe big book right now in liberal education circles is Paul Tough\u2019s\n*Whatever It Takes* \u2014 and with good reason. The book is touching and\ndelightful; it deftly mixes an intellectual history of the academic\ndebates around poverty with an on the ground look at programs to\nalleviate it, all in the best magazine feature style. But I found the\nbook disturbing in what it left out: the topics it failed to discuss and\nthe questions it failed to ask. For a book about education, there sure\nwasn\u2019t much in the way of critical thinking.\n\nThe book\u2019s practical hero is Geoffrey Canada, an African-American who\ngraduated from the Harlem ghettos to running local programs to help\nothers do the same. But he quickly became frustrated at the small scale\nat which he worked, \u201csaving lives\u201d one and two at a time, when thousands\nof others were all around him. So he decides to adopt a multiblock area\nof Harlem, which he calls the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, and do \u201cwhatever\nit takes\u201d to make sure the kids in it get to and graduate from college:\nparent training, afterschool programs, entirely new schools. And, the\nstory goes, there are fits and starts along the way, but he\u2019s really hit\non something big: the schools are a success, the press loves the story,\nBarack Obama vows to expand the program to a dozen more cities.\n\nAnd yet. The schools are considered a success because they pass New York\nState\u2019s standardized tests. And they do that because their\nprincipals\u2014under pressure from Canada to raise scores\u2014turn the schools\ninto 24-hour test prep centers. Kids start taking practice tests in the\nmiddle of 3rd grade and repeat them every six months so that they\u2019ve\nnear-memorized them by the time they have to take them for real. The\nschool day is lengthened and summer break is skipped so that there\u2019s\nmore time for test prep. There are even test prep sessions on weekends\nto make sure every kid gets the right grade.\n\nA couple characters\u2014including the middle school principal\u2014object,\nspouting lines about \u201cteaching the whole child\u201d and insisting it\u2019s a bad\nidea to replace music and art with more test prep. But they\u2019re given\nlittle quarter by the book and Canada eventually fires them because\nthey\u2019re not \u201cgetting results\u201d (i.e. high test scores). Most of the\nremaining teachers leave *en masse* after that.\n\nIt\u2019s weird. When it comes to their own kids, safely enrolled at suburban\nprivate schools, liberals don\u2019t seem to have much trouble seeing the\nproblems with high-stakes testing and the importance of music and art,\nbut when it comes to the urban poor such concerns suddenly become\nexpendable, mere niceties that distract from the real business of\n\u201ctougher standards\u201d. (For those who don\u2019t know the problems with\nstandardized tests, here\u2019s a few: Most of them are norm-referened,\ndesigned to ensure half the kids fail. You do better at them by thinking\nworse \u2014 skipping hard parts, guessing answers, skimming instead of\nunderstanding. And I have yet to see evidence that raising test scores\nleads to any good for kids.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a more serious problem with the whole theory that underlies\nthe book. The story\u2019s intellectual hero is James Heckman, a conservative\nUniversity of Chicago economist. Heckman has done a great deal of\nresearch on \u201chuman capital\u201d \u2014 his argument is that investing in early\nchildhood education pays off in the long run by making future workers\nmuch more productive, and thus wealthy. To prove this, he cites a number\nof studies, the most famous of which was on Perry Preschool. In that\nstudy, researchers followed a bunch of black kids in Ypsilanti, Michigan\nand gave half of them free preschool. Tracking them down again at age 27\nand age 40, they found the kids who went to preschool stayed in school\nlonger, graduated from high school more, had fewer teen pregnancies and\narrests, and made more money. Clearly we should give everyone free\npreschool!\n\nI have nothing against more free preschool, but this argument is flawed.\nWhat makes people stay in school, not get arrested, and make more money\nisn\u2019t preschool but a good job. A long line of research has shown that\nwhen kids have the prospect of a good job in front of them, they tend to\nbuckle down and work harder. Conversely, when jobs disappear, kids turn\nto drugs and crime and ditching school\u2014after all, why not?\n\nBut the Perry Preschool Program didn\u2019t create any new good jobs for\nthose kids. It just redistributed the ones that already existed, giving\nthem to the kids who went to preschool instead of those who didn\u2019t. If\neveryone in Ypsilanti had gone to preschool, things would be right back\nwhere they were before. (More technically, assume that an increase in\nhuman capital increases a worker\u2019s productivity. Universal preschool\nincreases the productivity of workers while leaving their supply at the\nsame level. If supply outstrips demand (i.e. there\u2019s unemployment),\nwages will be unchanged.)\n\nIf we truly want every kid to succeed, we need to create jobs for all of\nthem. And that will take fiscal and monetary stimulus, not just better\nschools.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1225522800.0, "postid": "whateverittakes", "internal_links": []}, "immoralfreaks": {"post_title": "The Immorality of Freakonomics", "tags": ["economics", "education"], "post_content": "The Immorality of Freakonomics\n==============================\n\nJune 17, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/immoralfreaks)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs the hype around the book *Freakonomics* reaches absurd proportions\n(now an \u201cinternational bestseller\u201d, the authors have been signed for a\nmonthly column in the *New York Times Magazine*), I think it\u2019s time to\ndiscuss some of the downsides that I mostly left out of my main review.\nThe most important of which is that economist Stephen Levitt simply does\nnot appear to care \u2014 or even notice \u2014 if his work involves doing evil\nthings.\n\nThe 1960s, as is well-known, had a major civilizing effect on all areas\nof American life.

The process involved a great\nnumber of things, notably the network of right-wing think tanks I\u2019ve\nwritten about elsewhere, but in the field of education it led to a\ncrackdown on \u201cthose institutions which have played the major role in the\nindoctrination of the young\u201d, as a contemporary report (*The Crisis of\nDemocracy*) put it.\n\nThe indoctrination centers (notably schools) weren\u2019t doing their job\nproperly and so a back-to-basics approach with more rote memorization of\nmeaningless facts and less critical thinking and intellectual\ndevelopment was needed. This was mainly done under the guise of\n\u201caccountability\u201d, for both students and teachers. Standardized tests,\nyou see, would see how well students had memorized certain pointless\nfacts and students would not be allowed to deviate from their assigned\nnumbers. Teachers too would have their jobs depend on the test scores\ntheir students got. Teachers who decided to buck the system and actually\nhave their students learn something worthwhile would get demoted or even\nfired.\n\nNot surprisingly, as always happens when you make people\u2019s lives depend\non an artificial test, teachers begun cheating. And it is here that\nProfessor Levitt enters the story. He excitedly signed up with the\nChicago Public School system to try to build a system that would catch\ncheating teachers. Levitt and his co-author write excitedly about this\nsystem and the clever patterns it discovers in the data, but mostly\nignore the question of whether helping to get these teachers fired is a\ngood idea. Apparently even rogue economists jump when the government\nasks them to.\n\nLevitt has a few arguments \u2014 teachers were setting students up to fail\nin the higher grade they would be advanced to \u2014 but these are tacked on\nas afterthoughts. Levitt never stops to ask whether contributing to the\nindoctrination of the young or getting teachers fired might not be an\nacceptable area of work, despite being an economist, he never weighs any\nbenefits or even considers the costs.\n\nLevitt, by all appearances, was not, like some of his colleagues, a\nself-conscious participant in this regressive game. He was just a rube\nwho got taken in. But surely preventing others from the same fate would\nbe a more valuable contribution.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1118991600.0, "postid": "immoralfreaks", "internal_links": []}, "meritocracy": {"post_title": "America After Meritocracy: Chris Hayes\u2019 *The Twilight of The Elites*", "tags": [], "post_content": "America After Meritocracy: Chris Hayes\u2019 *The Twilight of The Elites*\n====================================================================\n\nJune 20, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/meritocracy)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[[crossposted from Crooked\nTimber](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/18/guest-review-by-aaron-swartz-chris-hayes-the-twilight-of-the-elites/)]\n\nIn his new book, *The Twilight of the Elites: America After\nMeritocracy*, Chris Hayes manages the impossible trifecta: the book is\ncompellingly readable, impossibly erudite, and \u2014 most stunningly of all\n\u2014 correct. At the end, I was left with just two quibbles: first, the\nbook\u2019s chapter on \u201cpop epistemology\u201d thoroughly explicated how elites\ngot stuff wrong without bothering to mention the non-elites who got\nthings right, leaving the reader with the all-too-common impression that\ngetting it right was impossible; and second, the book never assembled\nits (surprisingly sophisticated) argument into a single summary. To\ndiscuss it, I feel we have to start with remedying the latter flaw:\n\nOur nation\u2019s institutions have crumbled, Hayes argues. From 2000\u20132010\n(the \u201cFail Decade\u201d), every major societal institution failed. Big\nbusinesses collapsed with Enron and Worldcom, their auditors failed to\ncatch it, the Supreme Court got partisan in *Bush v. Gore*, our\nintelligence apparatus failed to catch 9/11, the media lied us into\nwars, the military failed to win them, professional sports was all on\nsteroids, the church engaged in and covered up sex abuse, the government\ncompounded disaster upon disaster in Katrina, and the banks crashed our\neconomy. How did it all go so wrong?\n\nHayes pins the blame on an unlikely suspect: meritocracy. We thought we\nwould just simply pick out the best and raise them to the top, but once\nthey got there they inevitably used their privilege to entrench\nthemselves and their kids (inequality is, Hayes says, \u201cautocatalytic\u201d).\nOpening up the elite to more efficient competition didn\u2019t make things\nmore fair, it just legitimated a more intense scramble. The result was\nan arms race among the elite, pushing all of them to embrace the most\nunscrupulous forms of cheating and fraud to secure their coveted\npositions. As competition takes over at the high end, personal worth\nresolves into exchange value, and the elite power accumulated in one\nsector can be traded for elite power in another: a regulator can become\na bank VP, a modern TV host can use their stardom to become a\nbestselling author (try to imagine Edward R. Murrow using the nightly\nnews to flog his books the way Bill O\u2019Reilly does). This creates a\nunitary elite, detached from the bulk of society, yet at the same time\neven more insecure. You can never reach the pinnacle of the elite in\nthis new world; even if you have the most successful TV show, are you\nalso making blockbuster movies? bestselling books? winning Nobel Prizes?\nWhen your peers are the elite at large, you can never clearly best them.\n\nThe result is that our elites are trapped in a bubble, where the usual\npointers toward accuracy (unanimity, proximity, good faith) only lead\nthem astray. And their distance from the way the rest of the country\nreally lives makes it impossible for them to do their jobs justly \u2014 they\njust don\u2019t get the necessary feedback. The only cure is to reduce\neconomic inequality, a view that has surprisingly support among the\npopulation (clear majorities want to close the deficit by raising taxes\non the rich, which is more than can be said for any other plan). And\nwhile Hayes is not a fan of heightening the contradictions, it is\npossible that the next crisis will bring with it the opportunity to win\nthis change.\n\nThis is just a skeletal summary \u2014 the book itself is filled with\nluscious texture to demonstrate each point and more in-depth discussion\nof the mechanics of each mechanism (I would call it Elster meets\nGladwell if I thought that would be taken as praise). [So buy the book\nalready.](http://www.chrishayes.org/about/bio/) Now, as I said, I think\nHayes is broadly correct in his analysis. And I think his proposed\nsolution is spot on as well \u2014 when we were fellows together at the\nHarvard Center for Ethics, I think we annoyed everyone else with our\nrepeated insistence that reducing economic inequality was somehow always\nthe appropriate solution to each of the many social ills the group\nidentified.\n\nBut when talking to other elites about this proposal, I notice a\nconfusion that\u2019s worth clarifying, about the *structural* results of\ninequality, rather than the merely quantitative ones. Class hangs over\nthe book like a haunting spectre (there\u2019s a brief comment on p. 148 that\n\u201cMills [had] a more nuanced theory of elite power than Marx\u2019s concept of\na ruling class\u201d) but I think it\u2019s hard to see how the solution relates\nto the problem without it. After all, we started by claiming the problem\nis meritocracy, but somehow the solution is taxing the rich?\n\nThe clue comes in thinking clearly about the alternative to meritocracy.\nIt\u2019s not picking surgeons by lottery, Hayes clarifies, but then what is\nit? It\u2019s about ameliorating power relationships altogether. Meritocracy\nsays \u201cthere must be one who rules, so let it be the best\u201d;\negalitarianism responds \u201cwhy must there?\u201d It\u2019s the power imbalance,\nrather than inequality itself, that\u2019s the problem.\n\nImagine a sci-fi world in which productivity has reached such impressive\nheights that everyone can have every good they desire just from the work\nyoung kids do for fun. By twiddling the knobs on their local MakerBot,\nthe kids produce enough food, clothing, and iPhones to satisfy everyone.\nSo instead of working, most people spend their days doing yoga or\nfishing. But scarcity hasn\u2019t completely faded away \u2014 there\u2019s still\ncompetition for the best spots at the fishing hole. So we continue to\nlet those be allocated by the market: the fishing hole spot is charged\nfor and the people who really want it earn the money to pay for it by\nhelping people with various chores.\n\nIn this sort of world, inequality doesn\u2019t seem like much of a problem.\nSure, some people get the best fishing hole spots, but that\u2019s because\nthey did the most chores. If you want the spot more than they do, you\ncan do more work. But the inequality doesn\u2019t come with power \u2014 the guy\nwith the best fishing hole spot can\u2019t [say \u201cfuck me or you\u2019re\nfired\u201d](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/11/lizardbreath-meet-charter-cities/).\n\nThis sci-fi world may sound ridiculous, but it\u2019s basically the one\n[Keynes\npredicted](http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm)\nwe\u2019d soon be living in:\n\n> Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be\n> insatiable. But they fall into two classes \u2013 those needs which are\n> absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our\n> fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense\n> that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us\n> feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which\n> satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the\n> higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not\n> so true of the absolute needs \u2013 a point may soon be reached, much\n> sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are\n> satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies\n> to non-economic purposes.\n>\n> [\u2026] But, of course, it will all happen gradually, not as a\n> catastrophe. Indeed, it has already begun. The course of affairs will\n> simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups\n> of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been\n> practically removed.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what a reduction in economic inequality could achieve. The\ntrend in recent decades (since the fall of the Soviet Union and the\nruling class\u2019s relief that \u201cThere Is No Alternative\u201d) has been for the\npeople at the top to seize all the economic gains, leaving everyone else\nincreasing insecure and dependent on their largesse. (Calling themselves\n\u201cjob creators\u201d, on this view, is not so much a brag as a threat.) But\nwith less inequality, it could be otherwise. Instead of a world in which\nthere are a handful of big networks with the money to run television\nshows, everyone could afford to have [their Sunday morning\nconversations](http://up.msnbc.com/) filmed and livestreamed. Instead of\nonly huge conglomerates having the capital and distribution to launch\nnew product lines, everyone could make and market their own line of\n[underwear](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/26/kickstarter-of-the-day-flint-and-tinder-edition/)\nor [video\ngames](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/12/kickstarter_where_celebrities_can_go_to_get_money_they_don_t_need.html)\n([instead of just elite Red Sox\npitchers](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/06/_38_studios_and_kingdoms_of_amalur_how_curt_schilling_s_video_game_company_duped_rhode_island_out_of_75_million_.html)).\n\nEven on strict efficiency grounds, this strikes me as a more alluring\nview than the usual meritocracy. Why put all your eggs in one basket,\neven if it\u2019s the best basket? Surely you\u2019d get better results by giving\nmore baskets a try.\n\nYou can argue that this is exactly where technology is bringing us \u2014\n[popular kids on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOFRZ1wNLw)\nget made into huge pop sensations, right? \u2014 and the genius of Hayes\u2019\nbook is to show us why this is not enough. The egaliatarian demand\nshouldn\u2019t be that we need more black pop stars or female pop stars or\nYouTube sensation pop stars, but to question why we need elite\nsuperstars at all. I hope Hayes\u2019 next book shows us what the world\nwithout them is like.\n", "external_links": ["http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/18/guest-review-by-aaron-swartz-chris-hayes-the-twilight-of-the-elites/", "http://www.chrishayes.org/about/bio/", "http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/11/lizardbreath-meet-charter-cities/", "http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm", "http://up.msnbc.com/", "http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/26/kickstarter-of-the-day-flint-and-tinder-edition/", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/12/kickstarter_where_celebrities_can_go_to_get_money_they_don_t_need.html", "http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/06/_38_studios_and_kingdoms_of_amalur_how_curt_schilling_s_video_game_company_duped_rhode_island_out_of_75_million_.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOFRZ1wNLw"], "time": 1340175600.0, "postid": "meritocracy", "internal_links": []}, "easywayout": {"post_title": "Take the Easy Way Out", "tags": [], "post_content": "Take the Easy Way Out\n=====================\n\nSeptember 29, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/easywayout)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen I was a kid, people were always telling me that there was no\nsubstitute for hard work. If I wanted to be smart, I had to sit and\nforce myself to read hard books. If I wanted to lose weight, I had to\nforce myself to exercise. If I wanted to play piano, I had to force\nmyself away from the computer to practice. Cheating, they explained,\nwould only cheat myself in the end.\n\nAnd yet today I eagerly ran to the library to grab five large books (and\nreturn seven more), felt an itch to go jogging, and walked away from web\nsurfing so I could go practice a musical instrument. The adults were\ncompletely wrong.\n\nYour body\u2019s resistance to an activity isn\u2019t an obstacle to be overcome,\nit\u2019s a message that you\u2019re being an idiot, just like when your hand\nhurts after you punch a wall. The right solution isn\u2019t to start punching\nthe wall harder, it\u2019s to look around for a tool to help you do the job.\n\nIn the case of books, the key is that you need to be sure to read books\nthat are at your level. If you read books about subjects you don\u2019t know\nenough to understand or that use a dialect you\u2019re not familiar with,\nit\u2019s going to be hard and it\u2019s going to be a waste of time. With losing\nweight, the key is things like the Shangri-La Diet. And with learning an\ninstrument, the key is using [Bemani\ngames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bemani) that actually make music\nfun.\n\nI\u2019ve discussed the other two in other places, but why do Bemani games\nwork? First, you\u2019re playing real music. Normally when you play piano,\nyou have to start on baby songs which are both infantilizing and\nuninteresting, with real music not even on the horizon. Bemani games\nstart you on real songs from the beginning. Since the reason many people\nget excited about musical instruments in the first place is the chance\nto play their favorite song, this is a pretty compelling difference. And\nthe fact that the computer simplifies the song and fills in the notes\nyou don\u2019t play for you makes it possible.\n\nSecond, Bemani games provide clear additional results in proportion to\nadditional effort. This is what makes them so much fun. I don\u2019t know\nabout the real science, but in Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s novel *Kipper\u2019s\nGame* the plot revolves around some research showing that games like\nthat stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain. You get the high of\nachievement, but it quickly wears off as you get used to your new skill\nlevel, and so you want to do better so you can get another high.\n\nThis is also what makes these games so educational. Research on experts\nhas found such immediate feedback is essential to learning, calling the\ngeneral process \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d. In deliberate practice, \u201csubjects\nshould receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results\nof their performance. The subjects should repeatedly perform the same or\nsimilar tasks. When these conditions are met, practice improves accuracy\nand speed of performance on cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks\n(Fitts & Posner, 1967; Gibson, 1969; Welford, 1968).\u201d (K. Anders\nEricsson, et. al, \u201c[The Role of Deliberate\nPractice](http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf)\u201d,\n*Psychological Review*) Your attempts aren\u2019t random \u2014 it\u2019s very clear\nwhat works and what doesn\u2019t and you can adjust your strategies\naccordingly.\n\nThird, you can do them in small chunks. When you normally play an\ninstrument, if you hit a wrong note you often keep trying until you get\nit right. But with Bemani games, the music just keeps marching on\nwithout you. This might at first seem a disadvantage, but it means you\ndon\u2019t get hung up on a mistake, each attempt takes at most as long the\nsong does. With real music, if you hit a difficult part of the song you\ncan easily get stuck trying over and over to get it right, before\ngetting frustrated and giving up on the whole thing. Keeping the music\nmoving forces you to look at the bigger picture.\n\nThe flip side of this is that playing the games gives you a continuous\nsense of motion and progress. In the mid-1980s \u2014 the heyday of video\ngame research \u2014 some psychologists were trying to find out what video\ngames quite so much fun. They took the classic Wozniak/Atari game\n[Breakout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout) and started removing\ncomponents to see if kids stopped playing it. What they found was you\ncould remove just about everything \u2014 the levels, the score, the bouncing\noff the paddle \u2014 everything except for the animations of the bricks\ndisappearing. It was making the bricks disappear, somehow, that made the\ngame fun. (Mind at Play, Loftus and Loftus)\n\nI doubt Bemani games were made with these kind of principles in mind \u2014\nconsidering the history, it was probably just a coincidence. But it\nshows that you could have created Bemani from them. All you needed to do\nwas pay attention to the fact that learning an instrument was\nfrustrating and tried to eliminate the frustrating part. Good designers,\nwhen they see people having trouble using something they designed, don\u2019t\ntell the user to try harder. They fix the design. We should take the\nsame attitude when we design our life as well.\n\n*Thanks to Emmett Shear for suggesting pieces of this post.*\n\n*Updated 2006-10-09 to add the second paragraph of point three, which I\nsomehow omitted originally.*\n", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bemani", "http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout"], "time": 1159513200.0, "postid": "easywayout", "internal_links": []}, "underbok": {"post_title": "Our Underachieving College Presidents", "tags": [], "post_content": "Our Underachieving College Presidents\n=====================================\n\nFebruary 9, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/underbok)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![Book cover](image1_underbok)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691125961)\n\nIt would seem absurd to claim that nobody cares about the quality of\nhigher education. After all, anyone paying attention can name a dozen\nbestselling polemics off the top of their head \u2014 *The Closing of the\nAmerican Mind*, *The University in Ruins*, *Tenured Radicals*, *Higher\nSuperstitions*. But as Derek Bok points out in his quietly subversive\nnew book, *Our Underachieving Colleges*, these commentators have treated\nuniversities largely as a punching bag for their political and\nprofessional views, rather than out of any genuine concern for the\neducation of the students.\n\nA classic example are the heated debates about what should be in the\ncore curriculum. Should the humanities be required? Should things be\nfocused around the great books? What about classes in writing and public\nspeaking? Professors will happily argue about the proper allocation of\nrequired classes for hours, but you\u2019ll never once hear them comment\nabout the *way* in which these classes are taught. And without decent\ntechnique, it doesn\u2019t matter what the topic of the class is.\n\nBok shows deep familiarity with a largely-hidden literature about the\neffectiveness of college teaching. Nearly 80 percent of all college\ncourses are simply lectures by professors, a stunningly ineffective form\nof teaching. By the end of a lecture, a student remembers less than half\nof what was taught. Only a week later, that number is down to 20%. At\nsuch stunning rates, it\u2019s hard to imagine much is left after a month,\nlet alone by the time the student gets out of college.\n\nAnd yet nobody seems to care one whit. Bok is hardly to be excepted from\nthis criticism. After the Larry Summers scandal, he was appointed acting\npresident of Harvard University (and before that he was president from\n1971 to 1991). Bok expects to only have the job for a year and no doubt\nhis hands are tied in many ways \u2014 but rumor about campus is that he\nwants to make his year count. Yet Bok\u2019s biggest changes have been a\nrecommendation for more hands-on activities and the elimination of early\nadmissions. Not bad moves, by any means, but hardly anything like the\ndeep rethinking Bok\u2019s book suggests is necessary.\n\nBut if Bok \u2014 a thoughtful and intelligent figure who has written\neloquently about these problems \u2014 can\u2019t use his position \u2014 the most\nprominent spot in the entire field, with the deadline already on his\nhead freeing him from any accountability \u2014 can\u2019t do anything about these\nproblems, what hope do we possibly have? Opportunities like this come\naround once a century and it appears that Bok is going to blow it.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691125961)\n\n\n[image1_underbok]: image1_underbok.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691125961", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691125961"], "time": 1171008000.0, "postid": "underbok", "internal_links": []}, "soc2007": {"post_title": "Write Web Works With Me!", "tags": ["technology", "projects"], "post_content": "Write Web Works With Me!\n========================\n\nMarch 16, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/soc2007)\n\n* * * * *\n\nAre you a student?

Nevertheless, I\nthought I wanted to correct a common misconception.\n\nA lot of people seem to think the movie is just making fun of\nstereotypes.

The problem, I decided, was that there was just too much of it.\nSpam was mixed in with notes from friends along with important things\nfrom work and todo items I\u2019d written to myself. What I needed to do was\ngo thru and sort it \u2014 pick out the really important stuff to handle\nright away and move the junk to the bottom. So I wrote a little program\nthat would let me go through and sort my email into neat little folders\nordered by priority.\n\nWell, here\u2019s what happened: I sorted all my email, and then I didn\u2019t\nanswer any of it. I told myself that I shouldn\u2019t answer the unimportant\nstuff until the important stuff was taken care of, then when I looked at\nthe important stuff it seemed hard, so I decided to go read some blogs\nfirst. To this day, all those important emails are just sitting there.\n\nRecently, I came up with a really dumb system for handling my email:\njust do it. I\u2019d start at the top of my inbox, answer the most recent\nemail, and move on to the next one. No excuses. No matter what the email\nat the top was \u2014 no matter how difficult or awkward or unimportant, I\nhad to answer it. I couldn\u2019t move on to another email and come back to\nit later. I had to answer the most recent email, no matter what it was.\n\nBy the end of the day, I\u2019d answered a month\u2019s worth of email.\n\nWe procrastinate because we are afraid. We\u2019re afraid it\u2019s too much work\nand that it will drain us. We\u2019re afraid we\u2019ll screw it up and get in\ntrouble. We\u2019re afraid we don\u2019t know how to do it. We\u2019re afraid because,\nwell, we\u2019ve been putting it off forever and every time we put it off it\nseems a little more fearsome in our minds. That\u2019s why not putting things\noff is so liberating. We\u2019re forced to confront our fears, not let them\ngrow bigger by repeatedly running away. And when we confront them, we\nfind they\u2019re not so scary after all.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just apply to email, of course \u2014 it works for any todo\nlist. But only if you say no to reordering, prioritizing, estimating\ndeadlines, and doing the most important things first. Forget all that.\nDo it now.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1262937600.0, "postid": "doitnow", "internal_links": []}, "whosefreedom": {"post_title": "What\u2019s Freedom?", "tags": [], "post_content": "What\u2019s Freedom?\n===============\n\nJune 23, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whosefreedom)\n\n* * * * *\n\nGeorge Lakoff is a prominent cognitive scientist whose central insight\n(which is not to say that the idea originates with him) is that we can\nlearn about the structure of our thoughts by looking carefully at the\nwords we use to express them. For example, we think of time as a line,\nas you can see through phrases like \u201ctime line\u201d, \u201clooking forward\u201d,\n\u201cfurther in the past\u201d, etc. Similarly, we thinking is thought of as a\nkind of seeing: \u201cdo you see what I mean?\u201d, \u201cpulled the wool over your\neyes\u201d, \u201cas you can see from the book\u201d, \u201chis talk was unclear\u201d, \u201cthat\nsentence is opaque\u201d, etc.\n\nLakoff used these techniques to write a series of books describing the\nstructures of various ideas (*Metaphors We Live By*, *Philosophy in the\nFlesh*, *Where Mathematics Comes From*, etc.) but after the Republican\nRevolution of 1994, he turned the technique on politics, resulting in\nhis 1996 classic *Moral Politics*, which tries to explicate the\ncognitive models of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAfter the election of Bush~2~, Lakoff began talking about how\nRepublicans were better at \u201cframing\u201d, or using language to get people to\nagree with them, than Democrats. Lakoff that the process goes both ways:\nlanguage causes your mind to think of certain concepts which create\ncertain pathways in your brain. Thus Republicans, he said, through\nmassive repetition of certain phrases, were literally changing the\nbrains of the electorate to be more favorable to them. (\u201cIf this sounds\na bit scary,\u201d he writes, \u201cit should. This is a scary time.\u201d)\n\nAround the 2004 election, Lakoff skyrocketed to fame among Democrats,\nwho were convinced by his argument that fighting Republicans required\nnot just giving into Republican frames, but reframing the debate\nthemselves. He rushed out the slender book *Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant*,\na cobbled-together guide on his basic ideas and how progressives could\nuse them. The book stayed on the *New York Times* bestseller list for\nweeks.\n\nNow Lakoff is back with a more studied work, *Whose Freedom?*, which\ntries to focus in more detail on the differing views of one particular\nconcept: freedom. Lakoff starts the book by noting that in his 2004\nspeech at the Republican convention, Bush used \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cfree\u201d, or\n\u201cliberty\u201d once every forty-three words. Most progressives think of this\nsimply as a stunt \u2014 using feel-good symbols like flag and words like\nfreedom to distract from the real issues. But Lakoff argues something\nmuch deeper is going on: Bush is trying to change the meaning of freedom\nitself.\n\nSo what is he trying to change it to? Right away, the book begins to\nfall apart. Lakoff\u2019s definition of freedom is so broad (it encompasses\ndemocracy, opportunity, equality, fairness, education, health, the\npress, the market, religion, the military, academia, and privacy) as to\nbe fundamentally meaningless: \u201cEvery progressive issue is ultimately\nabout freedom,\u201d he concludes. And yet freedom is kept on as the book\u2019s\norganizing principle: instead of chapters about economics, religion, and\nforeign policy, we have the chapters \u201cEconomic Freedom\u201d, \u201cReligion and\nFreedom\u201d, and \u201cForeign Policy and Freedom\u201d.\n\nThis would be harmless if it was simply a rhetorical affectation, but\nLakoff still seems to think is fundamentally about freedom. As a result,\nthe chapters are not only weighed down with meaningless and silly\nattempts to connect the topic to freedom (\u201cLife is a progressive issue,\nsince progressive Christians are committed to promoting freedom, freedom\nfrom oppression and pain and freedom to realize one\u2019s dreams.\u201d \u2014 actual\nquote) but their actual substance is stripped bare, because it\u2019s not\ndiscussed in its own right, but merely as an aid to the book\u2019s\ndiscussion of freedom.\n\nThus instead of deriving his key theory of how family metaphors create\npolitical views, by showing how he discovered this and how it explains a\nlot about the world, he quickly asserts it and then tries to apply the\nidea to the empty void of \u201cfreedom\u201d. The result is a book that is\nfundamentally vacuous \u2014 its main idea has no substance and its\nsupporting ideas have no explanation.\n\nAnd for a linguist, Lakoff has a surprisingly tin ear for language. His\nsuggestions (like using the term \u201cfreedom judges\u201d to respond to\n\u201cactivist judges\u201d) are so bad that I assume they must not be meant to be\ntaken literally (\u201cjudges that will fight for freedom\u201d is more akin to\nwhat Lakoff means).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the book got into this sorry state, but the good news\nis there\u2019s hope. Lakoff\u2019s Rockridge Institute has been putting out\nthoughtful and valuable guides on how to think and talk about various\nissues and they plan to publish their major work, the Progressive\nManual, this summer. Let us hope that book does what this could not.\n\n*Disclosure:* I received a free review copy of Lakoff\u2019s book fedexed to\nme before the July 4 publication date.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1151046000.0, "postid": "whosefreedom", "internal_links": []}, "mylifewithtim": {"post_title": "My Life With Tim", "tags": [], "post_content": "My Life With Tim\n================\n\nAugust 25, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mylifewithtim)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*I wrote this years ago (probably the summer after college), filled with\nnostalgia, in a small notebook on a plane to or from Boston. (I finally\nunderstand how people can write books long-form!) I meant to type it in\nas soon as I got back and post it here, but I lost it and never got the\nchance. While moving recently it turned up again and I thought I should\nseize the opportunity to type it in while I still had my hands on it.\n(Also, coincidentally, I had lunch today with Tim.)*\n\n*Apologies for the poor writing; I\u2019ve improved a bit in the subsequent\nyears and it\u2019s rather hard to write well when you\u2019re pouring your\nmemories into a notebook on a plane.*\n\nIn 7th grade we were asked to do a project on the Great Men Who Made\nAmerica, or something like that. Other kids chose civil rights leaders\nand politicians and even scientists. Then a big tech geek, I chose my\nhero, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.\n\nOne of the first assignments was to do some research and answer a list\nof questions provided by the instructor (one of them being \u201cwhat did\nyour contemporaries think of you?\u201d \u2014 I still wince at not then knowing\nwhat \u201ccontemporaries\u201d meant). I was able to answer most of them off the\ntop of my head and most of the rest from TimBL (as he was universally\ncalled by all but Dave Winer)\u2019s web page. But a few, like \u201cDo you have\nany regrets?\u201d were not really answerable form such material. So, with\nsome trepidation, I sent him an email. His website said not to email him\nabout school projects on the Web, but I convined myself that school\nprojects on *him* didn\u2019t qualify. So I carefully composed my email and\nsent it out, hoping for the best.\n\nA few days later I received a rather short-tempered reply. \u201cRegrets?\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI have a few. But then again, too few to mention.\u201d (I didn\u2019t get\nthe reference until years later when I heard the words again over the\nradio \u2014 I thought he was just being poetic.) But my favorite answer was\nhis response to one of the theme questions I asked: \u201cHow do you think\nyour work has shaped America?\u201d or something like that. (I was taking the\nassignment a little too literally, I guess.) He shot back with a phrase\nthat\u2019s stuck with me ever since: \u201cI was an Englishman living in France\nand working in Switzerland \u2014 it\u2019s got nothing to do with America.\u201d I\nproudly reported this back to my teacher, complaining about his\nassignment\u2019s Amerocentrism.\n\nThe next time I check Tim\u2019s web page, it said not to email him\nconcerning school projects on the Web or on Tim Berners-Lee.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI didn\u2019t really run into TimBL again until a few years later when I was\nvisiting Cambridge, Mass., where he worked at MIT. I was working on RSS\nat the time with W3C employee Dan Brickly and I felt cocky enough to try\nto go see TimBL\u2019s office. I got as far as the nameplate outside his door\nwhen a gruff man with a beard stopped me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he\nasked. \u201cSeeing Dan Brickley,\u201d I lied. \u201cThat\u2019s not Dan\u2019s office,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cGo wait in the hall. I\u2019ll get Dan,\u201d said the man.\n\nThe man, I later learned, was Ralph R. Swick (or RRS), and it always\nstruck me that he hated me, or at least looked down on me because of my\nage. In this encounter he at least could claim to not know who I was,\nbut even later he would ignore me, ignore what I said, or in one\nparticular instance, make fun of me. (I\u2019ll get to that later.)\n\nDan, on the other hand, was glad to see me and took me on a tour of the\nW3C, where he and TimBL worked. \u201cIs Tim around?\u201d I asked casully. \u201cOh\nno,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s off in [foreign country].\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can\ntake you to meet our PR director and she can answer any questions you\nmight have.\u201d\n\nThis seemed like an odd move to me. At the time, at least, I was a\nco-worker, not a journalist. Still, why not. She gave me the standard\nspiel about the W3C, which of course I\u2019d already knew. (Although there\nwas one funny moment: \u201cThe Web is just 10 years old,\u201d she said,\nobviously repeating a standard line. \u201cWere you everything you are at 10\nyears old?\u201d There was an awkward pause as she tried to calculate my age\nand realized I might be.)\n\nEager to show her I knew what I was talking about, I decided to make an\ninformed criticism of the W3C. Maybe I challenged is corporate control,\nor the bylaws\u2019 undemocratic requirements that the Director (TimBL)\napprove everything, or maybe that and more. She gave me standard\nresponses, but I kept pushing and she got increasingly agitated and\neventually started shouting. I wasn\u2019t hurt, and pressed on, but against\nmy will I started crying (although I imagine it may have looked\nintentional \u2014 a cheap arguing tactic, perhaps). She offered me tissues\nand toned down, asking me to send her some concrete suggestions by email\nto consider.\n\nAs DanBri took me out, he tried to console me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said,\n\u201cshe scares everyone. That\u2019s what makes her so good.\u201d For whatever\nreason, she always seemed extra-nice to me after that.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI next ran into TimBL at a W3C conference in Cambridge, where they were\nhaving a meeting on RDF, which I was beginning to get interested in. The\nmeeting involved a series of presentations on various topics and through\nit all, TimBL struck me as incredibly brilliant. He would type away at\nhis laptop the whole presentation, apparently lost in some project and\nnot paying attention to anything. Then, towards the end, he would\nquickly raise his hand and ask the one question that revealed all the\nflaws of the presenter\u2019s assumptions, cutting through everything they\nsaid.\n\n![Me and Tim Berners-Lee](image1_mylifewithtim)\n\nAt the end of the meeting, DanBri insisted I meet TimBL and so I went\nover to shake his hand. TimBL moved and talked so fast he appeared\nalmost as a blur, bursting with energy and bouncing around the room.\nDanBri took my camera and TimBl slowed down for a moement to grab me\naround the shoulder and pose for a picture, a photo which I later used\nfrequently. (God, I looked so young!)\n\nI met a bunch of other cool people at the meeting \u2014 B.K. DeLong, who\nintroduced me to Tantek (then at Microsoft, he looked for all the world\nlike a Borg; he later joined Technorati and hounded me incessantly to\ntake a summer internship there (I was at dinner with him the other nigh\nand apparently he still thinks I should!))), libby, and the elusive\nmnot. But the one I remember most was Dan Connolly, or DanC as he was\ncalled.\n\nAt first, for some reason, I thought he was a kid. He wore a simple\nt-shirt and pulled out his guitar during breaks. His enthusiasm was even\ngreater than TimBL\u2019s and he was clearly just as sharp, although in some\nways more so, since he had a programmer\u2019s logicalness that he applied to\nevery aspect of his life.\n\nHe worked from home in Kansas City, where he lived with his wife and\nkids. TO balance work and family, he worked out a contract with his\nlife, which meant that at 5:00 he would stop whatever he was doing, no\nmatter how important, for Family Time.\n\nI would follow him around on the RDF chatrooms and could feel myself\ngrowing more logical just by listening to him. When I could I would sort\nof apprentice under him, following along and helping as he wrote\nprograms to do various tasks. I even considered going out to visit him\nin Kansas City at one point.\n\nHe was an enormous influence, despite his socially conservative politics\n(which I always attributed to his location). He was usually quiet about\nthem, but once he posted a petition in favor of parental abortion\nnotification laws. At the time I was a radical on children\u2019s rights at\nleast, and thought parents shouldn\u2019t be notified about anything. He also\nmentioned he was trying to figure out why his school *wasn\u2019t* teaching\nIntelligent Design (then a new phrase to me), absurdly suggesting he had\nto follow the money. It turns out following the money is much better at\nfinding why people *do* teach Intelligent Design.\n\nStill, I suppose everyone has flaws, and these were relatively minor.\nIt\u2019s clear why TimBL chose DanC to be his right-hand man, handling the\ndetails for anything important.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe next time I met TimBL was at the WWW2002 conference in Hawaii. DanC\ninvited me to wake up early for a \u201cSemantic Web Swim\u201d with him and TimBL\nbut, ashamed of my body at the time, I stupidly declined \u2014 a move I\nstill regret.\n\nOne night DanC, some other people, and I went out to a place on the\nbeach. I, I have to say, didn\u2019t have a sip of alcohol \u2014 I still haven\u2019t,\nactually \u2014 but everyone else got hammered. (I was worried some of them\nmight walk into the ocean by accident and get swept away.) I left my\nparticipation ambiguous, however, when I posted a short note in an\nobscure place on my blog, but John Robb, then-CEO of UserLand Software\n(Dave Winer, founder) found it and quoted me on his blog with the\ncomment \u201cAaron is 14. Someone should tell his parents.\u201d (No one ever\ndid, as far as I know.) The next day, when I went to see UserLand\nemployee Robert Scoble give a talk, I accidentally let my badge in the\nhotel room and was dragged out of the talk by security.\n\nOn Semantic Web Developer Day, I gave a short presentation about a\nproject I was working on. Ralph Swick (the gruff fellow, you\u2019ll recall)\nalso gave a presentation. I got in line to ask him a question, but I was\nlast and we were out of time. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quick,\u201d I lied. \u201cOK, they said.\n\u201cHave you thought at all about the privacy implications of this?\u201d I\nasked (for his software was a total privacy nightmare). \u201cYes,\u201d RRS\nresponded and everybody laughed. I went back t the audience feeling like\na jerk and RRS ignored me when I tried to ask him to elaborate\none-on-one.\n\nIt was in the hallway one day that I first really talked to TimBL. He\nwas breezing down the corridor when he spotted me and ran up. \u201cAaron!\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI really appreciate all the work you[\u2018re doing \u2014 it\u2019s great\nstuff. Do you think maybe you could help with a little project?]\u201d\nFlustered, I said of course. He outlined a project having to do with\nencrypted RDF and I eagerly volunteered, amazed at my good fortune.\n\nA few days later, at a conference dinner, I got my food and was looking\nfor a place to sit, when TimBL came by. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019ve\ngot a place for you\u201d and he brought me over to the W3C table, seating me\ndirectly across from him, which was simply amazing. The table was full\nof good cheer and Tim commemorated the moment by passing his camera\naround it and asking everyone to take a photo from their point of view.\n\nI last saw him as we were leaving when he pulled my mom aside and\nintroduced himself. \u201cAaron\u2019s doing great work,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m a\nlittle worried. The other night at dinner all he had was rice.\u201d \u201cOh,\nhe\u2019s just a fussy eater,\u201d my mom explained.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe last time my path crossed with TimBL is when I was applying for\nStanford. My Dad happened to be in Cambridge at the time and insisted on\nasking TimBL for a letter of recommendation, by going over to TimBL\u2019s\noffice. Apparently he had better luck than I, since I\u2019m told TimBL\nagreed and I was later accepted to Stanford. I guess a letter of\nrecommendation from the creator of the Web counts for something, even if\nhe is an Englishman.\n\n[image1_mylifewithtim]: image1_mylifewithtim.jpg", "external_links": [], "time": 1219647600.0, "postid": "mylifewithtim", "internal_links": []}, "whywikiswork": {"post_title": "Eight Reasons (Some) Wikis Work", "tags": [], "post_content": "Eight Reasons (Some) Wikis Work\n===============================\n\nDecember 12, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whywikiswork)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*published at [Personal Democracy\nForum](http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1121)*\n\nThe stunning success of Wikipedia in creating an encyclopedia from\nscratch has led many to believe that they can achieve similar results.\n(Want to get rich? Easy! Just install the MediaWiki software, title it\n\u201chow to get rich\u201d, and wait for the answers to start flowing in.)\n\nClearly the wiki approach does not solve every problem. So what made\nWikipedia work so well? We can\u2019t say for certain, but by looking at\nsimilar sites that haven\u2019t taken off \u2014 as well as those that have (like\n[TV IV](http://www.tviv.org/)) \u2014 we can spot some patterns.\n\n1.  **Clear goal.** Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It\u2019s an understandable\n    task with a clear end result. When you want to know something, you\n    know whether it\u2019s the kind of thing that might be in Wikipedia or\n    not. And when you want to contribute, you know what kinds of things\n    to add. By contrast simply adding a wiki to your existing website\n    has no clear purpose.\n\n2.  **Worth doing.** Collecting the sum of human knowledge in one place\n    is just the kind of grand goal that inspires their people to sink\n    their time into a big, collective effort. There are people on\n    Wikipedia who spend their time going down long lists of\n    computer-generated format and style errors, fixing each one by hand.\n    It\u2019s hard to imagine people putting the same amount of effort into\n    cleaning up a wiki about the greatness of Tide laundry detergent.\n    But people are willing to do it for something only a few people care\n    a lot about (like a very specialized technical topic) or something a\n    lot of people care a little about (like a piece of popular culture).\n\n3.  **Objective standards.** It\u2019s pretty clear what an encyclopedia\n    article should be. It needs to contain an explanation of what it is\n    and why it\u2019s important, the history, the uses (or actions),\n    criticism, and pointers to more information. And the whole thing\n    needs to be written in a plain, dry style. The result is that it\u2019s\n    pretty clear what needs to be done, which means everyone can work\n    together to do it. Contrast this with a novel, where the book\u2019s\n    success depends on the author\u2019s creativity and, well, novelty.\n\n4.  **Made from small pieces.** Encyclopedias are huge projects, but\n    they\u2019re made up of manageably-sized articles. If an article ever\n    grows too long, it can be split into parts (*see* [Al Gore\n    Controversies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore_controversies)).\n    When a page is small enough that the whole thing can fit comfortably\n    in your head, it\u2019s much easier to work with: you can write it in one\n    sitting, you can read it relatively quickly, and you can remember\n    the whole thing. Contrast this with books, which are so big that\n    working seriously on them requires special dedication.\n\n5.  **Each piece is useful.** Each article in an encyclopedia is useful\n    in its own right. Even if Wikipedia had just started and all it had\n    was an article about the Striped Burrowing Tree Frog, that page\n    would still be useful, just like every other page on the Internet\n    about an obscure topic. The page, if it was good enough, would show\n    up on the right Google searches and more Tree Frog fans would begin\n    contributing to it. And if that page worked well, it could easily\n    lead to others. Contrast this with a dictionary, which you\u2019re\n    probably only going to use if it has a high percentage of the words\n    you want to look up.\n\n6.  **Segmented subjects.** Few people are passionate about learning all\n    human knowledge. But many more people are passionate about some\n    subset of that. Encyclopedias allow the people who really care about\n    French social theorists to spend all their time on that, without\n    ever caring about the rest of the site. And the same is true of\n    readers. The result is that lots of different people can work on\n    lots of different parts, with the whole project getting done as a\n    result, even though nobody worked on that explicitly. Contrast this\n    with coming up with a theory, where the work requires understanding\n    all the data and thinking about it as a whole.\n\n7.  **Personally useful.** The best way to understand something is to\n    write about it and the best thing to write is a layman\u2019s\n    explanation. An encyclopedia provides a opportunity to do just that.\n    At the same time, it captures what you\u2019ve learned in case you forget\n    it later and gives the concept more form so that you\u2019re more likely\n    to remember.

Now the future isn\u2019t necessarily like the past \u2014 things\ncould go wrong \u2014 but it seems safe to, say, spend \\$5 to get a new\ncustomer. If the future is like the past, you\u2019ll make \\$45 each time you\ndo this. And even if future customers are only half as good as current\nones, you\u2019ll still be making \\$20 each time you do this!\n\nHow much money should you spend on marketing? Well, others have started\nto notice you making money hand-over-fist and have decided to start\ncompeting. Best to get people hooked on your service than on theirs,\nright? And each dollar you spend now is going to bring in ten times\nlater, so it\u2019d be crazy not to spend everything you could, right? You\u2019re\nonly making \\$10 million a year right now o you get your investors to\nput in another \\$100 million and quickly spend it all on marketing.\n\nNow by traditional accounting standards, you\u2019re \\$90 million in the red.\nBut that seems like a misleading way to count. After all, if you stopped\nmarketing tomorrow you\u2019d have a nice, profitable \\$10 million a year\nbusiness. Instead it makes sense to look at the \\$10 million dollars a\nyear you\u2019re making on the one hand and your aggressive expansion plan\n(in particular, how much it costs to get a new customer and the lifetime\nvalue expected from a new customer) on the other.\n\nThis, as best as I can tell, was the story of Groupon. They called that\nfirst number (the business you have now, aside from the expansion\nattempt) ACSOI.\n\nBut the press didn\u2019t seem to understand any of this. Groupon was\npilloried for playing accounting games that turned a huge loss into a\nmoderate profit. And when, in response, Groupon took the ACSOI numbers\nout of their prospectus, it was hailed as a victory over fraudulent\naccounting.\n\nWhich all strikes me as ridiculous. Groupon didn\u2019t hide the fact that\nthey were losing money by traditional accounting standards. They said so\nup front, but then provided the additional data that they use\ninternally. Just some additional information, no pressure: \u201cWhile we\ntrack this management metric internally to gauge our performance, we\nencourage you to base your investment decision on whatever metrics make\nyou comfortable,\u201d they said. How does taking this information out of the\nprospectus help anyone?\n\nNow there are valid questions about this model. Perhaps the future won\u2019t\nbe like the past, perhaps Groupon\u2019s cost-per-acquisition is way too\nhigh, perhaps trying to grow so fast is risky.

I get occasional requests to\nmake my libraries work in 3 but it\u2019s far from clear how to and when I\ntry to look it up I find all sorts of conflicting advice, none of which\nsounds very practical.\n\nIndeed, when you see new 3.x versions rolling off the line and no one\nusing them, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that Python might die in this\ntransition. How will we ever make it across the chasm?\n\nIt seems to me that in all the talk about Python 3000 being a new,\nradical, blue-sky vision of the future, we neglected the proven methods\nof getting there. In the Python 2 era, we had a clear method for adding\nlanguage changes:\n\n1.  In Python 2.a, support for `from __future__ import new_feature` was\n    added so you could use the new feature if you explicitly declared\n    you wanted it.\n\n2.  In Python 2.b, support was added by default so you could just use it\n    without the future declaration.\n\n3.  In Python 2.c, warnings begun being issued when you tried to use the\n    old way, explaining you needed to change or your code would stop\n    working.\n\n4.  In Python 2.d, it actually did stop working.\n\nIt seems to me this process worked pretty well. And I don\u2019t see why it\ncouldn\u2019t work for the Python 3 transition. This would mean mainly just:\n\n1.  A Python 2.x release that added support for\n    `from __future__ import python3`.\n\nPutting this at the top of a file would declare it to be a Python3 file\nand allow the interpreter to parse it accordingly. (I realize behind the\nscenes this would mean a lot of work to merge tr 2 and 3 interpreters,\nbut honestly it would always have been better to have a unified codebase\nto maintain.)\n\nThen if I wanted my Python 2 program to use some 3 modules, I just need\nto make sure those modules have the import line at the top. If I want to\ndo a new release of my module that works on Python 3, I just need to\ndeclare that it only works in Python 2.x and higher and release a\nversion that\u2019s been run through 2to3 (with the new import statement). If\nmy project is big, I can even port files to 3 one at a time, leaving the\nrest as 2 until someone gets around to fixing the rest. Most\nimportantly, I can start porting to Puhon 3 without waiting for all my\ndependencies to do the same, parallelizing what until now has been a\nrather serial process.\n\nUsers know they can safely upgrade to 2.x since it won\u2019t break any\nexisting code. Developers know everyone will eventually upgrade to 2.x\nso they can drop support for earlier versions. But since 2.x supports\ncode that also runs in 3, they can start writing and releasing code\nthat\u2019s future-compatible as well. Eventually the vast major code will\nwork in 3 and users can upgrade to 3. (2.x will issue warnings to the\nremaining stragglers.) Finally, we can drop support for 2.x and all live\nhappily having crossed the bridge together.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a radical idea. It\u2019s how Python upgrades have always worked.\nAnd unless we use it again, I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re ever going to cross\nthis chasm.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1331280000.0, "postid": "python3", "internal_links": []}, "dennettdumb": {"post_title": "How Dumb is Daniel Dennett?", "tags": [], "post_content": "How Dumb is Daniel Dennett?\n===========================\n\nJanuary 19, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dennettdumb)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt continually amazes me how many otherwise-intelligent people I know\nclaim to be fans of Daniel Dennett, a bitter hack philosopher who spends\nhis days sucking up to scientists and writing personal attacks on other\nphilosophers.

Yesterday, for example,\nI spent all morning moving furniture (we\u2019re moving to a new apartment)\nand around lunch time I got invited to lunch at a favorite pizza place\nwith a friend and I jogged all the way there. Normally, at this point,\nI\u2019d be famished and devour half a pizza. This time, I wasn\u2019t hungry at\nall (but I had a slice out of politeness).\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no reason my particular anecdotes should be more\nconvincing than any others, but they are convincing to me, so I\u2019d like\nto move from discussing the diet to discussing its implications. Weight\nand trying to lose it is a huge part of American culture and a system\nthat makes doing it trivially easy will have far-reaching effects.\n\nThe most basic, it would seem, is more thin people. There\u2019s clearly an\nenormous number of people who want to lose weight. A lot are so\ndesperate that they will try any number of painful and crazy tactics,\nfrom Slim-Fast shakes to Atkins meals, that are touted as helping.\nObviously these people will try the diet.\n\nBut also a large number of people (like myself) who see themselves as\ntoo skeptical to fall for a fad diet or too lazy to jump through its\nhoops will try this diet, since it\u2019s both scientifically proven (or will\nbe, after further clinical trials) and super-easy. And unlike Atkins,\nthere are few concerns about nutritional dangers \u2014 the diet doesn\u2019t\nrequire you to change the balance of foods you eat, just the quantitity\n\u2014 so a bunch more reasons not to do it disappear.\n\nAs it takes off, commercial products will soon follow \u2014 branded\npocket-sized flasks of ELOO, for example. The media will do stories on\nthis latest craze and the ideas behind it. Clinical trials will\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and suggest areas for further research,\nwhich will lead to it being refined. And popular culture will likely try\nto deal with the results.\n\nAmong those results: lots of people you know getting thin. It\u2019s\ndifficult to imagine what this is going to be like. The fat guy at the\noffice won\u2019t be fat anymore. That cute-but-slightly-overweight girl\nyou\u2019ve had your eye on won\u2019t be slightly overweight anymore. Social\ndynamics will be seriously disrupted in a way that, to my knowledge, has\nno analog. People have gotten taller, and thinner, and prettier over\ntime, to be sure, but never quite this fast.\n\nThe flip side of the drive to be thinner is the discrimination against\nthose who are fat. American culture is simply vicious towards the less\nfortunate. You\u2019re poor because you\u2019re lazy, it says, and you\u2019re fat for\nthe same reason. If only you got some exercise or ate better, you\u2019d look\nfine. It\u2019s your own damn fault and there\u2019s nothing wrong with me looking\ndown on you for it.\n\nIf the theory behind the diet is correct, however, this just isn\u2019t so.\nFat people are that way simply because their body\u2019s set point is too\nhigh. That\u2019s not really anything you can blame them for and it\u2019s also\nsomething that, before the diet, was really hard to fix. They live with\na burden of wanting to eat that thin people, with their lower set point,\nnever have to deal with. And the entire time they\u2019ve been struggling,\nthey\u2019ve been told it\u2019s simply their own damn fault. (As I noted, their\nsituation mirrors that of the poor.)\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unlikely our culture will ever notice the horrors its\ncommitted against fat people. Instead, the diet is likely to make it\neven more vicious. Now that there\u2019s a simple easy way to get thin,\nanyone who refuses to use it will be turned against with serious scorn.\nBeing fat may become as much of a social rudity as being a smoker, with\nstrangers feeling that they can lecture you about your unhealthy\nlifestyle in public. It\u2019ll be pure torture.\n\nBut, I have no doubt, it\u2019ll work. Sipping ELOO is much easier than\nquitting smoking and tons of people are doing the latter. And so the\nlast few overweight people will be pushed to join the pack. While it\u2019s\nunlikely that obesity will be entirely eradicated, it\u2019s hard to imagine\nthe last few hangers-on (perhaps those for whom the diet doesn\u2019t work or\nwho can\u2019t do it for some reason) making up a significant sect of the\npopulation.\n\nThe diet book itself saves most of its vision for future generations\nwho, it suggests, will never have to think about obesity at all because\nthe new science behind the diet will allow us to build it right into our\nfoods, so that we will simply never get fat in the first place.\nCertainly, at a minimum, children\u2019s set points will be regulated from a\nvery early age (what parent wouldn\u2019t want to spare their child from\nfat-kid teasing?) and they\u2019ll likely never even consider another\npossibility.\n\nTo our children, obesity will probably seem like just another\nrelatively-rare disease, like a learning disability or a speech\nimpediment. They\u2019ll look back at movies from our time and think\u2014 well,\nactually, they won\u2019t notice anything because we\u2019ve already removed the\nfat people from them.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1146207600.0, "postid": "fatfuture", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/miraclediet"]}, "antisuit": {"post_title": "The Anti-Suit Movement", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Anti-Suit Movement\n======================\n\nMarch 16, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/antisuit)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI don\u2019t like wearing suits.

But the idea of doing political organizing\naround not wearing a suit just seems bizarre. It\u2019s hard to know who to\norganize \u2014 each event has a different group of people \u2014 and even if you\ncould find the people and they agreed with you, asking folks to join a\nno-suit pact just seems weird.\n\nSo suits are emblematic of this strange kind of politico-cultural issue\n\u2014 a political question that\u2019s not amenable to a political solution.

William Domhoff, is one of my very favorite\nbooks. But explaining why will take some background. In the 1950s and\n60s researchers were looking at what they called the \u201cpower structure\u201d\nin American cities \u2014 the people who really pulled the strings and called\nthe shots. Foremost among them was Floyd Hunter, whose study of Atlanta\npractically invented the field. Naturally the whole notion that anyone\nwas pulling the shots behind the scenes in America offended the deans of\nmainstream liberal political science and so their leader, Robert A.\nDahl, set out to defend democracy\u2019s good name.\n\nHe argued that one could only figure out who was in charge by doing\ncareful case studies \u2014 looking at controversial decisions and seeing who\nwas involved in making them \u2014 that and only that could tell you where\ntrue power lay. And, in his most famous work, *Who Governs?: Democracy\nand Power in an American City* he aimed to do just such a case study in\nhis hometown of New Haven, where his employer, Yale University, resides.\n\nDahl proposed a theory called pluralism in which no small elect is in\ncharge but power is instead shared across conflicting groups, each\nmarshaling its own resources on the issues it feels strongly about.\nDemocracy, although perhaps in a more sophisticated form, is vindicated,\nand the ridiculous notions of a shadowy elite disproven. As Dahl writes:\n\n> It is all the more improbable, then, that a secret cabal of Notables\n> dominates the public life of New Haven through means so clandestine\n> that not one of the fifty prominent citizens interviewed in the courts\n> of this study\u2014citizens who had participated extensively in various\n> decisions\u2014hinted at the existence of such a cabal; so clandestine,\n> indeed, that no clues turned up in several years of investigation led\n> to the door of such a group. (185)\n\nOf course that wasn\u2019t quite true. Domhoff was skeptical of Dahl\u2019s\nresults and decided to request access to his source material and\nreresearch the matter for himself. In going through Dahl\u2019s interview\nnotes, Domhoff found these choice comments:\n\n> First Informant said that [contacting the First National Bank] was\n> essential, that they had to deal with what he called the \u201cpower\n> structure\u201d if they wanted to accomplish anything. First Informant kept\n> emphasizing the \u201cpower structure.\u201d\n>\n> According to Second Informant, nothing gets done without the First\n> National Bank saying so. According to him, it is \u201cat the top of the\n> power structure.\u201d \u2026 I asked him why \u2026 [and he] said, \u201cJust look at\n> who\u2019s on its board of directors.\u201d \u2026 He said, \u201cThe bank\u2019s support is\n> necessary for anything that is done in this town including\n> redevelopment.\u201d (Sounds like a quote from Hunter.)\n\nBut, of course, Dahl wanted to disprove Hunter, not sound like him, so\nhe never followed up on these leads. But Domhoff does. In the\nintellectual battle over which version of how cities work is more\naccurate, he scores a decisive victory over Dahl. He not only takes\nDahl\u2019s method, he also takes Dahl\u2019s town and indeed his specific case\nstudy and shows how the decisions were made by a sinister cabal after\nall.\n\nAnd his results are much more convincing. Dahl, after all, was trying to\nprove a negative: that there *wasn\u2019t* anyone pulling the strings.\nWhereas Domhoff can simply point out who was. Dahl\u2019s central case study\nis the question of New Haven urban renewal. A bold Democratic mayor, he\nclaims, came into office and proposed a plan, dragging local businessmen\nand Federal officials along with him to get it done.\n\nNonsense, says Domhoff. The plan for urban renewal was drafted by the\nlocal chamber of commerce years before. And when the new mayor got\nelected, the Chamber of Commerce invited him to lunch and explained the\nwhole thing. They even told the mayor who to hire to carry the plan out\nand, in the end, got exactly what they\u2019d wanted all along.\n\nBut Domhoff doesn\u2019t simply prove Dahl wrong. He gives an engrossing case\nstudy of how powerful businessmen get things like this done, based on\nextensive archival research and contemporaneous notes. And he tells an\nentire alternative history of American urban renewal, showing how big\nbusiness turned a plan to build housing for the poor into an excuse to\nexpel them to make room for upscale businesses.\n\nThe result is a *tour de force*: a complete demolition of one of the\nmost influential books of political science, an engrossing case study of\nhow power really operates, and an example of how to do research into the\npeople who, after all, really rule.\n\n-   [My summary of Domhoff\u2019s\n    book](http://sciencethatmatters.com/archives/25)\n-   [An updated, enhanced, and online version of Domhoff\u2019s\n    book](http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/new_haven.html)\n-   [Domhoff\u2019s book\n    itself](http://openlibrary.org/b/OL8091744M/Who-Really-Rules%3F)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://sciencethatmatters.com/archives/25", "http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/new_haven.html", "http://openlibrary.org/b/OL8091744M/Who-Really-Rules%3F"], "time": 1237791600.0, "postid": "whoreallyrules", "internal_links": []}, "subjectivism": {"post_title": "Subjectivism", "tags": ["politics", "economics"], "post_content": "Subjectivism\n============\n\nOctober 19, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/subjectivism)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI have two friends \u2014 let\u2019s call them Q and R \u2014 whose political\nphilosophy I find alien and fascinating.

Welfare is thus a bad idea because it just\nmakes the poor feel worse \u2014 not only can they not make money, but they\nhave to come hat-in-hand to the government for help. My first reaction\nto this was that the poor were wrong: it wasn\u2019t their fault they were\npoor, they were just the losers in a rigged game. But, of course, they\ndon\u2019t know the game is rigged and things they don\u2019t know can\u2019t make them\nfeel better. By focusing on the objective facts, Q argues, we\u2019re\nignoring the actual lived experiences of the poor.\n\nQ is thus upset by socialist writers, like Orwell (*Down and Out in\nParis and London*, *The Road to Wigan Pier*) and Ehrenreich (*Nickel and\nDimed*, *Bait and Switch*), who attempt to get the reader to imagine\nwhat it would be like if they were poor. Because this is just another\nway of getting the reader to focus on the objective situation. In all\nprobability, the reader will *not* be poor ands thus the question of\nwhat it would be like is irrelevant; what\u2019s important is what it would\nbe like for the actual poor and that requires talking to them.\n\nR also objects to welfare policies, but on rather different grounds. R\nstarts from the premise that people are bad at making themselves happy.\nWell-to-do professionals, who seem so much better off than the poor, may\nnot actually be doing that much better. To continue to live in the style\nto which they\u2019ve become accustomed, they must work long hours at a job\nthey dislike. Because of the endowment effect, getting off this\ntreadmill would cause them even more pain. A few lucky people earn money\nat tasks they find fulfilling, but perhaps not many more than are happy\nbeing poor.\n\nWelfare \u2014 or, indeed, any proposal to improve the objective situation of\nthe poor \u2014 is a bad idea in R\u2019s view because it simply makes it harder\nfor them to get off the treadmill. One might think the right response to\nthis is what we might call (with apologies to Thaler) a kind of\nutilitarian paternalism, where the government steps in and shows people\nhow to be happy. But why would the government know how to be happy?\nHaving a satisfied life is a cultural problem, R argues, and the\nsolution lies in non-governmental steps to reform culture.\n\nI find these arguments interesting because they start from rather\ninarguable premises (what matters is how it feels to be poor, people\ndon\u2019t know the best way to make themselves happy) to draw very\nfrustrating conclusions.\n\nTake Q. Corporate profits (and thus employee pay) depend on how much of\na monopoly the company has. Even the secretary at Google is a\nmillionaire, while even the owner of a farm is desperately poor. There\u2019s\nno way to make a company in a competitive market pay more because there\njust isn\u2019t more money to pay. But getting rid of competitive markets\nseems like a bad idea; competition has clearly made our lives better.\nBut if we want to make things better for those who aren\u2019t paid well (and\nlet\u2019s just say we do, since that\u2019s kind of the basic premise of this\nwhole article), that just leaves transferring money from those who have\nit to those who don\u2019t. Which, according to Q, doesn\u2019t make anyone feel\nbetter.\n\nOther countries seem to deal with this by designing the money so that\nmoney isn\u2019t transferred directly, but is spent on universally available\npublic services. It\u2019s not that the French poor get given money they can\nspend on health care, it\u2019s that in France health care is free to\neveryone. Poor people don\u2019t feel singled out and aided\u2014everyone uses\ngovernment health care. (And the wealthy are much less likely to vote\nagainst programs they themselves use.)\n\nThis also goes some way to addressing R\u2019s objection: people aren\u2019t being\ngiven more money to spend how they see fit, they\u2019re being given access\nto services we expect to make them happy. And the access doesn\u2019t ever go\naway, so it doesn\u2019t contribute to the endowment effect.\n\nEven so, R would argue, much of these universal services are things like\neducation which make it so that a broader group of people can sign up to\nwork at rat race jobs and thus get on the unhappy treadmill. Why support\npolicies that bring more people into this unhappy system? (R also\nhappens to think schooling is bad on its own terms, as is health care,\nbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary for the argument.)\n\nBut a tax for service system compresses the whole wage structure. The\nwealthy earn less money, because they pay some of it in taxes, and thus\ndon\u2019t have as far to fall. And the poor get more services, which means\nthat even if the wealthy do lose their job and fall, they don\u2019t fall as\nfar, since the floor has been raised. All of this would seem to make it\neasier to quit a job you don\u2019t like. (Egads, I\u2019m mixing metaphors like\nThomas Friedman. Falling off a treadmill to services on a higher floor?)\nIndeed, in the extreme case, services would be so high you wouldn\u2019t have\nto work at all unless you wanted to. (Whether this extreme is\neconomically feasible is a separate discussion.)\n\nSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m for: democracy within organizations, transfers\nbetween organizations, and structuring the rules of the market to\nmaximize social benefit.

By the time the subway reaches the neighborhood, all the white\npeople have already left the train. The school itself is nestled into a\nbuilding long-ago abandoned by a Catholic High School. When it first\nmoved in, they found the remnants of the last high school class had\nnever been removed, their effects somehow frozen in time.\n\nThe streets are gritty, the faces dark, and I don\u2019t exactly feel\ncomfortable walking outside. This isn\u2019t the place you imagine starting a\n\u201cprogressive school\u201d. And when you learn that Mission Hill is a public\nschool, part of the Boston Public School system, it seems even less\nlikely. Yet, when educational reformer Deborah Meier set out to build a\nmodern school, that\u2019s what she picked. They got a special license from\nthe government and the unions to operate it as a \u201cpilot school\u201d and\nbegun tossing out the normal rules and building it from the ground up on\nprogressive principles.\n\nMeier has since left, as has Straughton, her successor, leaving a woman\nwho introduces herself as Ayla (everyone here goes by their first\nnames). Ayla seems a little overwhelmed, both by the demands of the job\nand her sudden promotion to the top, but she somehow handles everything\nwith kindness and composure.\n\n\u201cWelcome to our school,\u201d she says, smiling so sweetly that I have\ntrouble believing she\u2019s a principle. As she continues talking, outlining\nthe school\u2019s unique mission and the \u201chabits of mind\u201d it hopes to\nachieve, some kids begin running and screaming in the halls outside. She\ngets up and heads to the door. *Now we\u2019ll get to see the other side of\nher*, I think. *She seems nice enough to us but she\u2019ll start screaming\nat the kids.* But she doesn\u2019t say a thing, she just closes the door and\nsits back down with us.\n\nAfter the overview, she takes us upstairs to get a sense of what\nclassroom life is like. The school is nice enough \u2014 \u201cI wish I went to\nschool here,\u201d the education students visiting with me gush \u2014 with happy\ndecorations, small class sizes (20 is the max.), friendly and dedicated\nteachers, and very active classrooms. The kids, a very racially mixed\ncrowd, seem quite bright and full of joy, and I can\u2019t help smiling for\nthe first twenty minutes, as we watch them bouncing around painting and\nsculpting.\n\nWhen we move to math class, things are a little different. For \u201cmorning\nmath meeting\u201d, the kids sit in a circle in the front of the room, as the\nteacher goes around asking each one to say something about subtraction\nbefore writing it on the board. The teacher tries to be non-judgmental,\nbut when someone says something wrong, he can\u2019t help but ask the rest of\nthe class if they think what that person said was right. (Once, when it\nactually was right, he has to add the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was\nwrong, I just want to know what other people think.\u201d) At one point, a\nchild asks him to write a one with twelve zeroes up on the board, saying\nit\u2019s a million. The teacher points out that it\u2019s a lot more than a\nmillion and counts out for the class what it actually is. He miscounts\nthough, and claims it\u2019s one septillion. (It\u2019s only a trillion.) I don\u2019t\nsay anything.\n\nLater, the teacher tells us how much he likes morning math circle\nbecause it gives everyone a chance to speak and think about things. But\nit\u2019s clear that most of the students are bored most of the time\n(including me) while others don\u2019t exactly enjoy speaking. Afraid they\u2019ll\nget the answer wrong and look stupid in front of the whole class, they\nspeak quietly or cover their mouth while they talk, trying to make sure\nonly the teacher can hear them. When the teacher indicates they were\nright and asks them to speak up, then they\u2019re happy to tell the rest of\nthe class.\n\nAfter everyone has spoken, the class adjourns so people can get the\nmemoirs they\u2019ve been working on to share with everyone. We head to a\nclass where they\u2019re shouting out the names of states on a map. The class\nis going to explain how America became America by looking at the\npatterns of migration on maps, the teacher assures us, but right now it\nlooks like the class is only memorizing how to spell stupid state names.\n\nAt this point our visit is officially over and we have to head back to a\nfinal wrap-up with the principal, but as I think about it and think back\nto my own school experience, I begin to wonder: is this any different?\n\nThere are some differences, of course. This school feels much cozier and\ncomfortable, for example. I don\u2019t feel odd just hanging out in the\nhalls. The teachers are all very self-conscious about trying to be\n\u201cstudent-centered\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d (the principal explains how they\nterminated their relationship with an afterschool program because they\nrefused to stop giving kids rewards, referring skeptical\nstudent-teachers to Alfie Kohn\u2019s books for \u201can extreme position\u201d on\nrewards). But while their hearts may be in better places, it\u2019s not clear\nthe effect is that much different.\n\nStill, that in itself is a pretty incredible achievement. I went to an\nextremely rich, white, private school on an expensive and lush campus in\nthe middle of the richest zip code in the country. That you can build a\npublic school of equal quality for kids in the inner city is an\nimpressive achievement.

There he offers you the choice of\none of two different kinds of soup that a woman in the kitchen (his\nwife, you presume) has made. You choose one and he pours you a bowl. It\nis delicious and you eat the whole thing before bowing deeply and\nheading for the door. But he blocks you and stares you down. You\u2019re\npuzzled; what does he want? He removes a coin from his pocket and begins\nfingering it. He gestures to your own pocket.\n\nYou look around and realize you were quite mistaken. This was not a\nfriendly old man inviting you back to his house for supper \u2014 this is a\nbarker attracting customers to his restaurant! And now, of course, he\nwants you to pay.\n\nNow you may pay \u2014 perhaps because you feel bad for the old man and woman\nand don\u2019t want them to be out money on your account, or perhaps because\nyou\u2019ve just noticed the menacing broad-shouldered fellow in the corner\nwith a club \u2014 but either way, you pay out of some personal desire: a\ndesire to help the couple, or avoid the club.\n\nUpon return to the States, you relax from your stressful journey by\nheading to your favorite restaurant. The waiter brings you a menu\nlisting the various options (it is a classy place, so no prices are\nmarked) and you say that you would prefer one. The waiter eventually\nreturns with it, you eat it, and it\u2019s delicious.\n\nNow the situation, despite seeming very similar, is somehow entirely\ndifferent. You feel an obligation to stay and pay the bill. Not simply\nbecause you don\u2019t want to get arrested, or because you want to be able\nto return to the restaurant later. You have a reason to pay the bill\nindependent of any of your own desires. You must pay the bill because,\nby sitting down and ordering, you promised you would.\n\nOne cannot accidentally promise, which is why the promise didn\u2019t exist\nin the foreign country, but you knew full well that ordering at the\nrestaurant in the States was a promise to pay full price at the end of\nthe meal. And by promising, you have created a desire-independent reason\nfor action, or, as I put it, a DIRFA.\n\nDIRFAs are surely the most amazing and confounding of all of Searle\u2019s\ndiscoveries. It seems crazy to think that there can be some magical\nrealm, independent of any individual human desire, to which we can be\ncalled to account. And yet, there it is. We pay at the restaurant not\nbecause we want to, or because we want to help certain others, but\nbecause we have committed to doing so and that commitment somehow binds\nus.\n\nIn his new book, *Making the Social World*, Searle shows that, contrary\nto appearances, DIRFAs (like all social institutions) are merely an\noutgrowth of language. This is an incredible claim, but Searle makes a\nconvincing case.\n\nImagine saying, \u201cBarack Obama is president of the United States.\u201d A\nsimple, unexceptional act. But simply by doing it, you have entered into\na whole series of social commitments. You have committed that you\nbelieve it. If you said it and did not believe it, people could rightly\ncriticize you for lying. And your belief commits you to its truth; if it\nturned out to be false, people could criticize you for being wrong. You\nalso commit yourself to communicating this belief; if you mumbled and\nyour audience misheard you, you could be criticized for being unclear.\nIf you were speaking to someone who had a friend named Barack Obama and\ndid not know of the other man with the same name who is currently the US\nPresident, you could be criticized for being confusing.\n\nA simple statement \u2014 the physical act consisting of a few vocal cord\nvibrations and associated lip movements \u2014 has pulled you into a whole\nweb of social attachments and commitments. To communicate presupposes a\nwhole system of social ontology.\n\nIt is difficult to overstate the implications. Much of political thought\nis about why people participate in institutions that do not benefit\nthem. Why don\u2019t the workers rise up and overthrow capitalism if all they\nhave to lose are their chains? Is it because hegemony has persuaded them\nthat the existing order is just and natural? Searle lays the foundations\nfor a much simpler solution.\n\nKaczynski argued that the left was the result of oversocialization.\nLeftists took the social constraints they were taught \u2014 don\u2019t\ndiscriminate on the basis of race, for example \u2014 so strongly that they\nbegin applying them much more widely than the others around them. But\nSearle shows how this is a necessary outgrowth of empathy, the left\u2019s\ndefining traits: social institutions are grounded in a form of\ncollective intentionality, where others count upon you to obey the\ninstitutional rules. Someone who can better imagine others\u2019 minds must\nfeel this network of expectations on them to be especially strong.\n\nThis book feels like Searle\u2019s last book. It weaves together the entire\nscope of his career \u2014 from speech acts, to consciousness, to politics \u2014\nin a single, stunning answer to this most vexing question: how can we\nmere sacks of meat, through brute physical acts, create constructions\n(like promises, or money, or corporations) that can then turn around and\nbind us. How glorious to see an entire lifetime of work coming together\nto answer this question at last.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195396170)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195396170"], "time": 1267689600.0, "postid": "dirfas", "internal_links": []}, "mlk2": {"post_title": "In His Own Words 2", "tags": [], "post_content": "In His Own Words 2\n==================\n\nJanuary 17, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mlk2)\n\n* * * * *\n\n> I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely\n> disappointed with the white moderate.

At the office, on the subway, in\na park \u2014 if you\u2019re quiet, you can listen to people chat. If you do, you\nquickly find that, for the most part, they have conversations that seem\nperfectly boring. This is most obvious on IRC (Internet text chat)\nwhere, since the conversations are entirely textual, they can be\nperfectly transcribed. If you look at the transcripts later, you find\nthey\u2019re often almost unreadable \u2014 even in channels dedicated to very\ntechnical topics, you\u2019ll find hours of conversation about someone\u2019s dog.\n\nSuch conversation clearly does not perform an objective\ninformation-sharing function \u2014 the relevant facts about the dog can be\nlaid out in a paragraph (if that). It serves a social function \u2014 a\nfunction with a deep evolutionary history. Primates get to know each\nother through grooming each other\u2019s fur. But that\u2019s time-consuming; as a\nresult, primates rarely form groups larger than 25. One of the big\nbreakthroughs for humans was moving from grooming to gossip. Instead of\n25 people, the average human knows 150. And so we talk, and as we talk\nwe reveal our personalities to each other: the things we care about, the\nway we think, the subjects we understand. We make friends through this\nprocess of conversation and personality reveal, even though objectively\nthe conversation is about matters that seem trivial. When it comes to\nour friends, we know a lot of trivia.\n\nWhat Twitter^[1](#fn:1)^ does is automate this process. Instead of\ntelling your bit of gossip or joke or humdrum story or minor complaint\nto each of your friends as you see them, you tell it once to Twitter,\nand then all your friends can see it. And just like the transition from\ngrooming to gossip, Twitter allows for an explosion in the number of\npeople we know. Where, in the past, it was only practical to have these\nkinds of close, chatty friendships with a handful of people (even using\na technology like IM), now \u2014 using the power of the Web to bridge time\nand space \u2014 you can have them with hundreds.\n\nBut the relationships need not be symmetrical. One of the things that\u2019s\nclear about celebrities in the age of television is that they take\nadvantage of this innate social sense. (*Fahrenheit 451* is caustic on\nthis subject.) We see these people all the time, we listen to them, we\nwatch them \u2014 and we come to feel as if we *know* them. And so,\nnaturally, our innate social sense kicks in and we want to hear their\ngossip \u2014 a need tabloids try their best to fill.\n\nTwitter provides a more raw, unmediated access to celebrity gossip.\nInstead of hearing about it second-hand from TV news, we hear about it\nstraight from them. Oprah, of course, has been a pioneer of this: with a\ndaily long-form television show, she\u2019s been able to cultivate (and\nmonetize) a friendship with millions. But most celebrities don\u2019t have\nthat kind of access to their \u201cfollowers.\u201d They do on Twitter.\n\nThe catch, of course, is that it\u2019s all somewhat fake. What you see on\nOprah\u2019s show isn\u2019t the real Oprah; it\u2019s a hyperreal Oprah, a\ncarefully-crafted simulation of a gregarious friend chatting with you in\nyour living room \u2014 makeup, lighting, sets, and script are all carefully\nplanned to seem \u201cnatural.\u201d And most Twitter feeds are the same \u2014\nhumorists spend days polishing the one-liner they seem to carelessly\ntoss off, politicians have speechwriters thinking up soundbites that\nthey can tweet.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just fake, it\u2019s empty. The reason such apparently boring\nconversation is interesting is because the act of conversation itself\nreveals your personality. We assume we know the people whose petty\ncomplaints and daily routines we\u2019ve heard so much about because,\ntraditionally, the only way to hear such things was to get to know them\nwell. But it\u2019s impossible to really know someone through sanitized\nsoundbites. In 140 characters, there\u2019s little room for the nuances of\npersonality such conversation typically reveals. So, like Oprah\u2019s\naudience, we all see the carefully-prepared facade people *want* to\npresent, and come away thinking that we know them better than we really\ndo.\n\nWith people we know in \u201creal life,\u201d this isn\u2019t such a big deal. We\nalready know their personality; Twitter simply helps maintain our\nrelationship by keeping us up-to-date. And while, in doing so, it lets\nus maintain vastly more relationships, I\u2019m not sure this is a bad thing.\nMany people are starved for human relationship \u2014 we spend most of our\nlives at the office, or at home watching TV and playing video games.\nMost Americans live in suburbs with no street life and even in cities\neveryone\u2019s wearing iPods and thus unable to stop and chat. If Twitter\ncan help bring us together in an increasingly isolated world, then all\nthe better (and, it seems, with some positive political consequences as\nwell).\n\nBut, for the people we don\u2019t know, it has the effect of making them all\nOprah. In the same way her millions of fans trust her book ([and movie\nand health and plastic surgery\u2026](http://www.newsweek.com/id/200025))\nrecommendations unquestioningly, because they feel that they know her,\nTwitter can make us trust other celebrities. If you feel like your\nSenator is a personal friend (and how can you not, after hearing them\ntell you about their struggle to lose weight and the guy they met at the\ngym?), then how could you possibly vote against them?\n\nThis isn\u2019t new, of course. It goes back as far as radio (possibly\nfurther). Pappy O\u2019Daniel did it in Texas in the 1940s. He got on the\nradio every day at noon and just chatted, like an old friend \u2014 sang a\nfew songs, read a little of his poetry, but mostly he just talked with\nquiet cheer. And people treated him like a friend: he asked them to buy\nhis flour (simply other companies\u2019 flour repackaged with his picture on\nit and resold at a higher price) and they bought it.

Lots of people got outraged \u2014 it seemed like a classic example of\na deregulator-in-chief helping his corporate friends at our expense. Not\nCass Sunstein, a prominent (and nominally-liberal) law professor.\n\nSunstein, working for and with right-wing deregulatory think tanks,\npublished a piece called \u201cThe Arithmetic of Arsenic\u201d, arguing that\neveryone needs to stop being so *emotional* about these things. We can\u2019t\ndecide whether arsenic should be in our water based on fuzzy-wuzzy\narguments about not killing people. No, we need to be hard-headed\nrealists and decide exactly how much a human life is worth and whether\nfiltering arsenic is worth the cost. In short, we have to do\n*cost-benefit analysis*.\n\nAs fellow law prof Tom McGarity pointed out, Sunstein continued to hold\nthis view despite the fact that Sunstein\u2019s own research into the subject\nshowed that there was so much uncertainty around the issue that just\nusing different previously-published estimates could result in whatever\nconclusion you like. And there was no obvious way to decide which\nestimate to trust.\n\nAll of this would be just another story in the annals of out-of-touch\nintellectuals \u2014 a law professor who gets off on killing people to save\nmoney, actual facts be damned \u2014 except for one frightening fact: Barack\nObama just put this law professor in charge of cost-benefit analysis for\nthe whole government.\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) was set up by\nRonald Reagan to allow him veto power over any federal regulation. If\nthe EPA wanted to stop companies from poisoning fish, if the DOJ wanted\nto stop businesses from discriminating, if OSHA wanted to protect\nminers\u2019 lungs, OIRA could intervene and double-check their cost-benefit\nanalysis. They could rejigger the numbers to make it so that the\nregulation got killed or if they failed at that they could just demand\nmore and more research from the agency, delaying the regulation it was\nfinally abandoned.\n\nOIRA was one of Reagan\u2019s most powerful tools for keeping the Federal\nGovernment from doing its job.

It is not meant to be representative of\nany other experience.*\n\nThe other year, when I was [living in a\ncabinet](http://www.flickr.com/photos/33809408@N00/150538078/), someone\nemailed me to ask if I had found a decent place to stay. \u201cOh, don\u2019t\nworry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping outside the Coop.\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know Cambridge, the Coop is the Harvard-affiliated\nbookstore in the center of town. It has an odd sort of recessed\nentrance, that means there\u2019s plenty of outside-but-sheltered space to\nsleep at night and anyone who walks through the town late at night sees\nmany (presumably homeless) people in sleeping bags taking advantage of\nit.\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe my claim for a second and ever since that\u2019s always\nirked me. Why is it so unbelievable that I might live beneath the Coop?\nIt\u2019s got a fantastic location (Harvard Square is perhaps my favorite\nplace in the world), nice atmosphere, and plenty of neighbors. Is a\nperson like me living there really so improbable?\n\nSo ever since, I\u2019ve had it in the back of my mind that I would spend a\nnight at the Coop. The opportunity finally arose last week, when I\nfinally got my hands on a decent sleeping bag.\n\nI made meticulous preparations. I took the bag and rolled it around in\nthe dirt to scuff it up a big, so it didn\u2019t stand out so much (this\nreally didn\u2019t do a whole lot, to be honest). Then I changed into\nsweatpants and a non-descript T-shirt. I left my shoes but put on a\ncouple layers of socks, two subway fares and my keys. I buried the keys\nin a park by my house, spent one fare getting to Harvard Square, buried\nthe other one inside Harvard, and then took my sleeping bag to a spot\noutside the Coop.\n\nThe digital clock hovering over us read exactly 10:00.\n\nA musician was performing directly outside the Coop. He was quite good,\nsold a couple CDs, and encouraged people to visit his website. In\nbetween songs, he\u2019d make odd jokes about songs about his lack of a\ngirlfriend. He chatted with a less coherent fellow on a bicycle who rode\nby sometimes.\n\nThere was a man in an orange jacket who really got into dancing to the\nmusic, before he finally took his place on a mat outside the Coop.\nAnother man with a green sleeping bag turned in. I watched the big\ncrimson flags outside the store wave, marvelling at their beauty.\n\nAround 11 a whole group of kids blew through the square, seeming\nsomewhat drunk and laughing. Little snippets of conversation could be\nheard.\n\nThat\u2019s one odd thing about Harvard Square. If you sit at in the square\nand listen to people, you hear them talking about boys and homework.\nMeanwhile, I ordered breakfast once at a dingy little shop here in Davis\nSquare, Somerville, and the girl behind the counter was arguing with the\ntwo older cooks about how the welfare policies of socialist countries\naffect their marriage rates, doing it as if it was the most natural\nthing in the world. After that, Harvard students really don\u2019t impress\nme.\n\nAround 11:30 it was getting pretty empty and the musician began packing\nup his stuff. I didn\u2019t last much longer, so I laid my sleeping bag out\nalong the side of the Coop and climbed inside. There were about five or\nsix people on the other side, all tiled in nicely with each other, all\nin a different sort of gear.\n\nI drifted in and out of consciousness for a bit, heard odd noises going\npast us on the street. Finally, I fell asleep around midnight (my usual\nbedtime), and didn\u2019t wake up until 5am when a subway train rolled\nunderneath me. Everyone was still there, the day was still dark and\nquiet. I wanted to watch the sunrise but fell back asleep and didn\u2019t\nwake up until 8, by which time the sun had most certainly risen and\neveryone else had left. It had apparently rained overnight, because the\nground was thoroughly soaked, and I tried to avoid the puddles as I went\nto dig out my subway fare.\n\nIt was right where I left it and I got onto the train without incident.\nMy keys were where I left them as well and I managed to get into the\napartment just in time for work.\n\n*What was so hard about that?*, I thought.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/33809408@N00/150538078/"], "time": 1161673200.0, "postid": "coopnight", "internal_links": []}, "mlk22": {"post_title": "More MLKJ Day", "tags": [], "post_content": "More MLKJ Day\n=============\n\nJanuary 27, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mlk22)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[This episode of *The Boondocks*](http://www.mininova.org/tor/200949)\nabout Martin Luther King, Jr. is amazing.

Bill Clinton, for example, took away what\nmeager assistance the government paid to poor single mothers, signed\nNAFTA, and begun attempting [to chip away at Social\nSecurity](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fedagencies/jan-june98/security_4-7a.html).\n\nBut even worse than these policy defeats are the conceptual defeats that\nunderly them. As cognitive scientist [George Lakoff has\nargued](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001118) people think about\npolitics through conceptual moral frames, and the conservatives have\nbeen masterful at creating frames for their policies. If the left wants\nto fight back, they\u2019re going to have to create frames of their own.\n\nEnter Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy\nResearch and one of the people instrumental in fighting back against the\nmost recent attempt to privatize social security (as author *Social\nSecurity: The Phony Crisis* he had plenty of facts to demonstrate that\nthe crisis was, in fact, phony). He has a new book out, *The\nConservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay\nRich and Get Richer*, which takes decades of conservative frames and\nstands them on their head. (Disclosure: I liked the book so much I\nconverted it to HTML for them and was sent a free paperback copy in\nreturn.)\n\nHis most fundamental point is that conservatives are *not* generally in\nfavor of market outcomes. For far too long, he argues, the left has been\ncontent with the notion that conservatives want the market to do what it\npleases while liberals want some government intervention to protect\npeople from its excesses.\n\n*No way!*, says Baker. Conservatives *love* big government \u2014 only they\nuse it to give money to the rich instead of the poor. Thus the\nconservative nanny state of the title, always looking out for crybaby\nmoneybags to help.\n\nTake, for example, trade policy. The conservative nanny state is more\nthan happy to sign free trade agreements that let manufacturing jobs in\nthe United States flee offshore. And they\u2019re happy to let immigrant\nworkers come into the country to replace dishwashers and day laborers.\nBut when it comes to the professional class, like doctors, lawyers,\neconomists, journalists, and other professionals, *oh no!*, the\nconservative nanny state does everything it can (through licensing and\nimmigration policy) to keep foreign workers out.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just help the doctors, it hurts all of us because it means\nwe have to pay more for health care. NAFTA boosters estimate that the\nentire agreement saved us \\$8 billion dollars a year. Using competition\nto bring only doctor\u2019s salaries down the levels seen in Europe would\nsave us *eighty* billion dollars \u2014 nearly \\$700 per family per year,\njust from improved prices for doctor\u2019s. You\u2019d see similar amounts from\nother major professions.\n\nBaker\u2019s book is also one of the few to reveal the shocking secret behind\nthe Federal Reserve Board you always hear messing with interest rates on\nthe news. This unaccountable technocracy, most of whose members are\nappointed by banks, uses its power over interest rates to drive the\neconomy into a recession so that wages won\u2019t get too high. That\u2019s right,\nthe government tries to slow down the economy so that you get paid less.\n(Full details are in the book.)\n\nBaker\u2019s book is also chock-full of fascinating new policy ideas. He\npoints out, for example, that corporations aren\u2019t part of the free\nmarket, but instead a gift offered by the government. (A very popular\none too, since companies voluntarily pay \\$278B each year for it.) And\nbecause of this, there\u2019s absolutely no reason the government can\u2019t tweak\nits terms to make us all better off. For example, Baker points out that\ncurrently, corporate rules count shareholders who don\u2019t vote at all as\nvoting in favor of whatever the director\u2019s of the corporation prefer.\nBaker suggests requiring that all CEO pay packages get approved by a\nmajority of those actually voting, instead of letting major CEOs pick\nhow much to pay themselves as they do now.\n\nOr what about copyright and patents? Again, this isn\u2019t a law of nature,\nbut a big government gift. People who really care about shrinking\ngovernment would want to try to get rid of or shrink the laws that say\nthe government gets to make rules about what songs and movies we can\nhave on our personal computers.\n\nAmericans spend \\$220 billion on prescription drugs, largely because of\ngovernment-granted patents. Instead of handing that money to big drug\ncompanies, the government could spend far less (only a couple hundred\nmillion) funding researchers itself and making the resulting drug\ndiscoveries free to the public. College students spend \\$12 billion.\nAgain, the government could make free textbooks for one-thousandth that.\nAnd we spend \\$37 billion on music and movies. Why not create an\n\u201cartistic freedom voucher\u201d (vouchers \u2014 a conservative favorite!) that\ncan only be spent on artists who place their work in the public domain?\n\nNone of these would require outlawing the existing system \u2014 they could\nwork side-by-side, simply forcing the existing drug, textbook, and movie\ncompanies to compete with this alternate idea. If their version works\nbetter, then fine, they\u2019ll get the money. But if not, there\u2019ll be no\nconservative nanny state to protect them.\n\nSimilarly, the government could expand the social security program,\nallowing every to buy additional personal accounts from a system with\namazingly low overhead (.5% versus the 20% of private funds) and a\n70-year track record of success. Or it could try to improve our\npitifully-bad health care system by letting people buy into the\ngovernment\u2019s Medicare program, which again has amazingly low\nadministrative costs (did you know that, on a per person basis, we spend\n80% of what Britain spends on health care altogether simply on\nadministration?) and serious bargaining power to push down prices.\nAgain, why not let the private companies try their best to compete?\n\nThe book itself also discusses bankruptcy laws, torts and takings, small\nbusinesses, and taxes. And it goes in to far more detail on each of\nthese subjects. And it\u2019s all available for free on the Internet, so\nthere\u2019s no excuse for not reading it. It\u2019s an fun read, the kind of book\nthat turns the way you think about the economy upside-down.\n\n-   [Official website](http://www.conservativenannystate.org/)\n-   [PDF version](http://www.conservativenannystate.org/cnswebbook.pdf)\n-   [HTML version](http://www.conservativenannystate.org/cns.html)\n-   [Paperback version](http://www.lulu.com/content/301875)\n\n\n[image1_cns]: image1_cns.jpg", "external_links": ["http://www.conservativenannystate.org/", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fedagencies/jan-june98/security_4-7a.html", "http://www.conservativenannystate.org/", "http://www.conservativenannystate.org/cnswebbook.pdf", "http://www.conservativenannystate.org/cns.html", "http://www.lulu.com/content/301875"], "time": 1148281200.0, "postid": "cns", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001118"]}, "campaignirony": {"post_title": "The Credibility Gap", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Credibility Gap\n===================\n\nNovember 15, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/campaignirony)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was, you may recall, a truism of the campaign that Barack Obama did\nnot have the experience to \u201clead\u201d, while Hillary Clinton and John McCain\nclearly did. This was a difficult point to argue against politically \u2014\nvoters knew that John McCain and Hillary Clinton had been in government\nand on TV for many years and looked old and respected, while Barack\nObama looked young and new. And yet, the exact opposite was true: Barack\nObama was the only one of the three who was a competent leader.\n\nThis was seen, foremost, in the management of their campaigns. Hillary\nClinton\u2019s campaign consisted of friends and loyalists, each with\npoorly-defined job titles, who took every opportunity to attack their\ncoworkers for their own benefit. (\u201cIt was a terribly unpleasant place to\nwork,\u201d [explained](http://www.newsweek.com/id/167582/output/print) a\nClinton staffer. \u201cYou had seven people on a morning call, all of whom\nhad tried to get someone else on the call fired, or knew someone on the\ncall tried to get them fired. It was not a recipe for cohesive team\nbuilding.\u201d)\n\nSpending was out of control, the campaign lurched from message to\nmessage, and her senior advisors were woefully ill-advised. (Top\ncampaign strategist Mark Penn, who didn\u2019t even quit his day job as CEO\nof the most notorious corporate public relations and unionbusting firm,\ndidn\u2019t even know that states awarded delegates proportionally.) Bill\nkept interfering, backchanneling with staffers and giving speeches\nwithout clearance, while Hillary got angry and threw fits.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise. [As far back as\n2004](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/001600.html),\nBrad DeLong was trying to talk people out of supporting Hillary for\nPresident, based on her total failure at health care reform in 1993/4.\nHis explanation is worth quoting at length:\n\n> [W]hen senior members of the economic team said that key senators like\n> Daniel Patrick Moynihan would have this-and-that objection, she told\n> them they were disloyal. When junior members of the economic team told\n> her that the Congressional Budget Office would say such-and-such, she\n> told them (wrongly) that her conversations with CBO head Robert\n> Reischauer had already fixed that. When long-time senior hill staffers\n> told her that she was making a dreadful mistake by fighting with\n> rather than reaching out to John Breaux and Jim Cooper, she told them\n> that they did not understand the wave of popular political support the\n> bill would generate. And when substantive objections were raised to\n> the plan by analysts calculating the moral hazard and adverse\n> selection pressures it would put on the nation\u2019s health-care system\u2026\n\nHillary fans later tried to assure him that she had change, but this\ncampaign seems to have borne out his original estimation.\n\nJohn McCain\u2019s campaign consisted of extremists pulled from Bush\u2019s\nentourage and beyond, who pressured the candidate into compromising his\ninstincts, policies, and principles. Used to running small, personal\ninsurgent campaigns, he let his Bush-backed campaign advisors spend\nmoney on huge offices and ad buys meant to convey a sense of\ninevitability. (It didn\u2019t work \u2014 the Bush base never contributed the\nmoney needed to pay for it all and it was largely scrapped when the\ncampaign went bankrupt.)\n\nHis policy advisors came not just from the Bush team, but from the gamma\nquadrant. When McCain slipped up and said he wouldn\u2019t meet with Latin\nAmerican dictators like the President of Spain, McCain\u2019s foreign policy\nadvisor insisted this wasn\u2019t a gaffe \u2014 that McCain wasn\u2019t planning to\nmeet with the man who pulled his troops out of Iraq. On health care, the\ncenterpiece of their plan was to raise the price of insurance so that\npeople wouldn\u2019t buy so much. On the economy \u2014 well, on the economy\nMcCain seemed to announce a new plan every day. He canceled his campaign\nand flew to Washington to demand a meeting with the President on the\nbailout bill, but when, in the meeting, he was asked what his position\nwas, he stormed out of the room. When the bill came to the floor, he\ntook credit for putting it together. When it failed, he took credit for\nmaking sure it didn\u2019t pass. When a modified version passed, he took\ncredit for that too. And in the debates, he seemed to announce new\nprograms off-the-cuff, like one plan to have the government buy up all\nbad mortgages directly.\n\nHis management was similarly erratic. He liked to call staffers directly\nwith ideas, in a subversive attempt to overthrow his own chain of\ncommand. He liked running his mouth off to the press and had to be\nrestrained by his own staffers. Indeed, his whole campaign seemed like a\nstruggle between two aspects of his personality. One knew what he had to\ndo to win and put structures in place to do it, the other wasn\u2019t so big\non winning and tried to subvert those same structures.\n\nWhen a spokesperson, Jill Hazelbaker, called Obama\u2019s trip overseas a\n\u201ccampaign rally\u201d and \u201cone giant photo opportunity\u201d, McCain told the\npress he disagreed and would speak to her about it. Upset, Hazelbaker\nrefused to come into work or return McCain\u2019s phone calls. His campaign\nmanager told him he [had to\napologize](http://www.newsweek.com/id/167865/page/2) to his\nspokesperson. Isn\u2019t it supposed to work the other way around? Then\nagain, it does kind of explain why McCain addressed a group of\nsupporters as [\u201cmy fellow\nprisoners\u201d](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFm5kK4f1k).\n\nBarack Obama was a serious contrast. He picked the most experienced and\ntalented staffers from the past Democratic campaigns. With a deft\nunderstanding of how to manage large, volunteer organizations from his\ndays as a community organizer, he gave them clear roles and managed them\neffectively. With millions of volunteers around the country, he built\nwhat was probably one of the largest organizations in the country, and\nthe whole thing went off like clockwork, with everyone having clear,\nachievable goals and being held accountable for meeting them \u2014 despite\nthe vast majority of them being unpaid volunteers!\n\nWhen it came to policy, he put together advisory teams on each topic\nthat contained leading experts from a variety of perspectives and tried\nto synthesize a coherent and centrist policy from each of them. The\nresults were not perfect, but they were far more detailed and thoughtful\nthan anyone expected from a Presidential candidate and tend to impress\npolicy experts. (Compare this to their usual reaction to campaign\nmaterial which is to hide their eyes and insist \u201cwell, (s)he really\ndoesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d)\n\nHis team had a strategy and message and, for the most part, stuck with\nit, despite the usual fluctuations and setbacks. People weren\u2019t\ncapriciously fired (with the exception of foreign policy advisor\nSamantha Powers, who was axed for calling Hillary \u201ca monster\u201d) or\nreshuffled. They did their jobs and they did them well. \u201cNo drama Obama\u201d\nwas the slogan and they carried it out \u2014 no big changes or fights or\nleaks.\n\nHis transition has shown a similar preparedness and focus. He\nimmediately assembled a council of varied and respected advisors on the\nfinancial crisis and later other topics. (Although at times the teams\u2019\nmembership criteria can be puzzling.) One member of his team talks to\nthe public (through Sunday show interviews and YouTube videos), while a\nwebsite keeps everyone up-to-date. His staff does a thorough review of\neach candidate\u2019s background and each agency\u2019s operations. His team is\neven reviewing every Bush executive order to see which ones need to be\noverturned.\n\nNo doubt he will be a similar president: a competent manager, surrounded\nby effective and experienced people, all trying to do good things\nwithout fuss. The only remaining questions \u2014 remaining, clearly, because\nthe answers haven\u2019t been decided yet \u2014 are who those people will be and\nwhat good things they will carry out.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/id/167582/output/print", "http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/001600.html", "http://www.newsweek.com/id/167865/page/2", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFm5kK4f1k"], "time": 1226736000.0, "postid": "campaignirony", "internal_links": []}, "googled": {"post_title": "Googling for Sociopaths", "tags": [], "post_content": "Googling for Sociopaths\n=======================\n\nDecember 14, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/googled)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the best things about capitalism is the way it handles\nsociopaths.

True, they\u2019re far from\nperfect, but you have to admit it\u2019s a lot better than mass slaughter.\n\nMany books have been written about Google, even though we\u2019re all pretty\nfamiliar with the company to begin with, but what makes Ken Auletta\u2019s\n*Googled* interesting is that it\u2019s a history of the company as told by\nthe incumbent sociopaths.

The sociopaths may be outraged, but this is exactly what\u2019s\n*supposed* to happen. Most people don\u2019t have a vested interest in\nwhether ABC does well or even continues to exist. What they want are\ngood television shows at a reasonable price, and if they can get those\nfrom Apple and Google instead of their local cable company, then bully\nfor Apple and Google.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s hard for the sociopaths to get their head around is\nthat this isn\u2019t because one of their rivals has outsmarted them \u2014 it\u2019s\njust the march of technology. When the only way to get most television\nshows to people\u2019s houses was over a wire or across airwaves that could\nonly hold so many channels, their particular distribution model made\nsense. But when the same connection \u2014 whether cable, DSL, satellite, or\nWiFi \u2014 can let people download whatever video program they choose, an\nentirely new model can take hold. The shift isn\u2019t Google\u2019s fault any\nmore than America should be blamed for breaking off from Pangea.\n\nAs a result, the closest people to moguls behind the recent shifts in\nmedia distribution are two computer science grad students: Larry and\nSergey. These guys don\u2019t even have the decency to behave like real\nmoguls \u2014 they wear t-shirts and sneakers, get bored during meetings, and\nlike to travel around the world instead of around Manhattan. What\u2019s\nworse, they\u2019re constantly talking about \u201cmaking the world a better\nplace\u201d (by, for example, donating 1% of their profits to charity) and\n\u201cempowering the user\u201d (by cutting out middlemen and not forcing choices\ndown people\u2019s throats). Sociopaths don\u2019t talk like that! Who do these\npeople think they are?\n\nGoogle gets a lot of criticism (often deserved), but it\u2019s worth taking a\nmoment to think of all the things they haven\u2019t done. If Microsoft had\nGoogle\u2019s market share in search, is there any doubt that they\u2019d be\nsystematically demoting or even banning their competitors in the search\nresults? Demoting someone in Google is a virtual death sentence, and yet\nnot only has Google never been accused of using this vast power, the\nidea itself is almost unimaginable.\n\nHearing things from the sociopaths\u2019 perspective, it\u2019s easy to get\nfooled. \u201cYeah!\u201d you think. \u201cWhy should these Google guys get to control\neverything?\u201d But for average people, this shift has been great: much\nmore stuff is available, faster and freer than ever before, and the\npeople making all the money off of it are actually decent human beings\nwho feel some responsibility for the planet they inhabit. Sure, I don\u2019t\nagree with them on everything and there\u2019s a lot more they can do, but\nlet\u2019s not lose sight of the basic point: at least they\u2019re not\nsociopaths.\n\n-   [Buy the book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594202354)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594202354"], "time": 1260777600.0, "postid": "googled", "internal_links": []}, "researcherjob": {"post_title": "Researcher Job", "tags": [], "post_content": "Researcher Job\n==============\n\nDecember 27, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/researcherjob)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI\u2019m looking for a researcher to work with on a couple projects.

These models are powerful because they\u2019re so\ndeeply-ingrained we don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re using them. They just seem\nlike \u201ccommon sense.\u201d In politics, there are two major models for how\nvoters think, which I\u2019ll call the median voter model and the mixed voter\nmodel.\n\nThe median voter model says that politics lives on a line from left to\nright. Voters are scattered across this line and vote for the politician\nthat\u2019s closest to them on it. Politicians get elected by \u201cpositioning\u201d\nthemselves closest to the most voters, which usually means in the\n\u201ccenter\u201d of the line.\n\nThere are some complications, though. Because primary voters tend to be\n\u201cmore extreme\u201d (i.e. Democratic primary voters are all on the left,\nRepublicans on the right), politicians take a more extreme tack during\nthe primaries, before heading back to the center for the general. And\nbecause they don\u2019t want to seem like flip-floppers, they\u2019re somewhat\nconstrained by the primary positions they take.\n\nBut, in general, this model is pretty widely-accepted in politics. So\nwidely that it\u2019s not even thought of as a model \u2014 it\u2019s implicitly\nassumed by all the things political commentators say. Comments like\n\u201cHe\u2019s moving to the center to pick up votes,\u201d \u201c[X] couldn\u2019t get elected\nin that district, so how is someone more extreme going to make it?\u201d only\nmake sense because we all have this model in our heads.\n\nBut, while I haven\u2019t studied the question in detail, there doesn\u2019t seem\nto be much evidence for this model. Even intuitively, it doesn\u2019t make\nsense: does the average person really develop a location on a\none-dimensional issue spectrum and then figure out where various\npoliticians stand on that same spectrum? The notion seems almost\nridiculous.\n\n**UPDATE:** Andrew Gelman has studied the question in detail, and\n[concludes](http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/11/politicians_have_a_lot_of_leew.html)\nthat the median voter theorem doesn\u2019t seem to be true: \u201cMy research with\nJonathan Katz suggests that being a moderate is worth about 2% of the\nvote in a congressional election: it ain\u2019t nuthin\u2019, but it certainly is\nnot a paramount concern for most representatives. \u2026 Incumbent\ncongressmembers almost always win reelection. And, when they don\u2019t,\nthey\u2019re often losing as part of a national swing (as in the 1994\nRepublican sweep or the 2006/2008 Democratic shift). And when an\nincumbent does lose unexpectedly, it can be for something unrelated to\ntheir votes (remember the \u201ccheck kiting scandal\u201d of 1992?).\u201d\n\nThe mixed voter model, promoted by George Lakoff and most prominently\nadopted by Howard Dean, says that voters aren\u2019t rational, coherent\nevaluators but a bundle of feelings, prejudices, and contradictions.\nPoliticians get elected by playing on the feelings voters already have\nthat would encourage a voter\u2019s\u2019 support. Thus, instead of moving to the\ncenter to get more votes, Lakoff argued politicians should actually\nbecome more extreme. Conservatives won votes by appealing to people\u2019s\nsense of order; liberals would have to respond by appealing to their\nsense of empathy. Moving to the center by promoting a compromise\nposition that prevented rhetorical appeals of either type, was doomed.\nThis model was used to explain why radical conservative politicians kept\nwinning elections against moderate and centrist Democrats, when there\nwas no evidence of a conservative electorate.\n\nThis model makes much more sense to me, although again I haven\u2019t seen\ntoo much specific evidence for it. But it\u2019s still pretty rare and seems\ndeeply-counterintuitive to most practitioners of politics. But whether\nit\u2019s right on the details or not, it\u2019s clear that unless we evaluate and\nquestion these models and think about them critically instead of just\nassuming one is true, it\u2019ll be hard to make much political progress.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/11/politicians_have_a_lot_of_leew.html"], "time": 1248764400.0, "postid": "medianvoter", "internal_links": []}, "tdk": {"post_title": "What Happens in *The Dark Knight*", "tags": [], "post_content": "What Happens in *The Dark Knight*\n=================================\n\nNovember 1, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdk)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Spoilers, obviously.*\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, in [*Batman\nBegins*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/batmanbegins) 1960s-style full\nemployment and antipoverty programs lead to skyrocketing crime while in\n[*The Dark Knight Rises*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr)\n1980s-style tough-on-crime policies and neoliberal economics lead to a\nrevolt of the economic underclass. The films are mirror images, one\nabout the failure of liberal policies; the other about the failure of\nconservative policies. In this sense, *The Dark Knight* is truly the\nfinal film in this nihilistic trilogy, documenting the hopelessness of\nanything outside that usual left-right struggle.\n\nFrom the start, the city is torn about how to handle the Batman, who has\ninspired a wave of second-rate imitators. Some believe it\u2019s wrong to be\nidolizing a masked vigilante, but most (including the new DA, Harvey\nDent) approve of his results.\n\nDent is doing his own part to lock up the criminals, working inside the\nsystem. He\u2019s arrested all the mob bankers (except Lau) and is now going\nafter the gangsters themselves, starting with mob boss Maroni (who took\nover for mob boss Falcone). But while the prosecutions bring him a great\ndeal of political attention, they don\u2019t seem to achieve much in the way\nof concrete results \u2014 new gangsters spring up to take the place of\nwhoever Dent arrests.\n\nDent decides the only way to win is to go big \u2014 really big. He arrests\neveryone at once, on charges that are unlikely to stick. Dent doesn\u2019t\ncare that he\u2019s breaking the rules, as long as it solves the problem. He\ncites the Romans who suspended democracy to protect their city.\n(Although, as Rachel points out, they ended up losing democracy.) \u201cYou\neither die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the\nvillain,\u201d Dent explains. He hopes to take up Batman\u2019s mantle, but do it\nfrom inside the system.\n\nBut, as the mayor explains, Dent isn\u2019t just taking on his own sense of\nethics, he\u2019s taking on the entire system: \u201cthe mob, politicians,\njournalists, cops \u2014 anyone whose wallet\u2019s about to get lighter\u201d. If he\nfails, both of their careers are over.\n\nJust as Dent is frustrated with the justice system, the Joker is\nfrustrated with the criminals. He tells them they need to go big: they\nneed to kill the Batman. He offers to do it for a sizable sum of money,\nwhich the gangsters eventually agree to. The Joker is obsessed with the\n*homo economicus* of game theory (from whence his name?): when the\ngangsters ask why he needs the money to kill the Batman, he explains\n\u201cLike my mother used to tell me: if you\u2019re good at something, never do\nit for free.\u201d\n\nThe film opens with the Joker hiring five men to rob a mob bank: Dopey\nsilences the alarm, Happy shoots him and drills through the vault,\nGrumpy shoots him and empties the cash into duffel bags, a bus runs him\nover, Bozo shoots the bus driver. Finally, Bozo pulls off his mask to\nreveal he\u2019s the Joker. This is a classic [pirate\ngame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game) and, just as in the\ntheory, the Joker gets to keep almost all the cash.\n\nBatman eventually tries to track down the Joker by threatening the\ngangster Maroni. But it\u2019s no use, as Maroni explains: \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna\ntell you anything\u2014they\u2019re wise to your act\u2014you got rules. The Joker,\nhe\u2019s got no rules. No one\u2019s gonna cross him for you.\u201d This is a\nstraightforward application of game theory\u2019s [Davies-Folk\ntheorem](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/11/29/reputations-are-made-of/):\nthe rational thing is to seem irrational so your opponents can\u2019t count\non you doing the rational thing.\n\nAlfred sees this quickly, because it reminds him of a story from his own\npast:\n\n> I was in Burma. A long time ago. My friends and I were working for the\n> local government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal\n> leaders, bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were\n> being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit. We were asked\n> to take care of the problem, so we started looking for the stones. But\n> after six months, we couldn\u2019t find *anyone* who had traded with him. \u2026\n> One day I found a child playing with a ruby as big as a tangerine. \u2026\n> The bandit had been throwing the stones away. \u2026 Some men just want to\n> watch the world burn.\n\nNote the parallels. In Alfred\u2019s story the entire status quo (including\nthe local government and tribal leaders) is totally corrupt: *the\nofficial plan* is to bribe people. But the plan is defeated by someone\neven crazier, someone willing to steal the money but not interested in\nkeeping it for himself.\n\nSure enough, when the Joker finally does get his hands on the money, he\nmerely lights it on fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Dent\u2019s ethical compromises begin to grow and grow. When he\nkidnaps one of the Joker\u2019s thugs, he tries to threaten information out\nof him. This is something Batman does routinely, but Batman reminds Dent\nthat Dent can\u2019t get away with that sort of thing \u2014 it\u2019d destroy his\ncredibility as an insider.\n\nIn a climactic scene, the Batman finally confronts the Joker in the\nmiddle of the street. The Joker knows Batman lives by just one rule (\u201cI\nwill not be an executioner\u201d) and encourages him to break it and kill\nhim. But Batman can\u2019t bring himself to do it, he swerves at a key moment\nand ends up smashed while the Joker survives. (Yep: the Joker has just\nwon the game of [chicken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)).)\n\nWhen he comes to, the Joker tells Batman that despite nominally working\noutside the system, he\u2019s actually just the system\u2019s pawn:\n\n> To them you\u2019re a freak like me. They just need you right now. \u2026 But as\n> soon as they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll cast you out like a leper. \u2026 Their morals,\n> their code\u2026 it\u2019s a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble.\n> They\u2019re only as good as the world *allows* them to be. You\u2019ll see\u2014I\u2019ll\n> show you\u2026\n>\n> You have these rules. And you think they\u2019ll save you. \u2026 [But t]he only\n> sensible way to live in this world is *without* rules.\n\nGordon arrests the Joker and takes him to the major crimes unit, only to\nfind the Joker claiming Gordon does not actually control the unit \u2014 his\npeople actually working for mob boss Maroni. \u201cDoes it depress you,\nLieutenant, to know how alone you are?\u201d he asks (a classic\n[principal-agent\nproblem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem)).\n\nThe Joker has kidnapped both Dent and Rachel and set them both to blow\nso that Batman can only rescue one ([opportunity\ncost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)). Batman goes to\nrescue Rachel but the Joker has switched their addresses and he actually\nends up rescuing Dent^[1](#fn:pb)^. Rachel dies and Dent loses half his\nface, becoming Two-Face.\n\nReese, one of Bruce Wayne\u2019s employees goes on TV and threatens to reveal\nthe identity of the Batman, but the Joker calls in and asks him to stop.\n\u201cI had a vision,\u201d he says. \u201cOf a world without Batman. The mob ground\nout a little profit and the police tried to shut them down, one block at\na time\u2026 and it was so\u2026 boring. I\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d He threatens\nto blow up a hospital unless someone kills Reese. (He has thus\nconstructed a [trolley\nproblem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem): people must\ndecide whether it\u2019s better to let the 100 die or kill the 1.)\n\nAt the hospital, the Joker explains things to Dent:\n\n> Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey? I don\u2019t have a plan\u2026\n> The mob has plans, the cops have plans. \u2026 Maroni has plans. Gordon has\n> plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I\u2019m not a schemer, I\n> show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really\n> are.\n>\n> It\u2019s the schemers who put you where you are. You were a schemer. You\n> had plans. Look where it got you. \u2026 Nobody panics when the *expected*\n> people get killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan,\n> even if the plan is horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow a\n> gangbanger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up,\n> nobody panics. Because it\u2019s all part of the plan. But when I say that\n> one little old mayor will die, everybody loses their minds! Introduce\n> a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything\n> becomes chaos. I\u2019m an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about\n> chaos, Harvey? \u2026 It\u2019s *fair*.\n\nThis pushes Dent over the edge. He starts going after everyone\nresponsible for killing Rachel: He starts with Weurtz, who kidnapped\nhim. Weurtz gives up Maroni, who points to Ramirez, who helps him get\nGordon\u2019s family, who naturally gets Gordon.\n\nBatman, meanwhile, is also crossing lines. In his attempt to find the\nJoker, he has turned every cell phone into a spy device. Even he admits\nthis might be too much power for one man to have.\n\nThe Joker scares the city onto its two ferries. Once the ferries are in\nthe middle of the water, he cuts their power and gives them both a\nbutton to blow up the other ferry, thereby constructing a [prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) (one boat is\nfilled with real prisoners). The passengers discuss and vote. One of the\nprisoners makes a [Ulysses\npact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact) and [credibly\ncommits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency) by tossing\nthe detonator overboard.\n\nThe Joker also took a busload of people from the hospital to the Prewitt\nBuilding where, through the window, you can see Joker\u2019s thugs with guns\nholding hospital people hostage. Gordon rushes in to get the thugs, but\nBatman discovers the thugs are hostages and the hostages are the thugs.\n(The Joker is illustrating [\u201cThe Market for\nLemons\u201d](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons): if the\nJoker is making it easy for you to kill his henchmen, why should you\nbelieve they\u2019re actually his henchmen?)\n\n(Batman saves the hostages (dressed as thugs) and stops the SWAT team\nand takes out the thugs (dressed as hostages). Neither of the boats\ndecides to blow up the other and Batman prevents the Joker from\ntriggering the failsafe.)\n\nHe then goes to rescue Gordon, who is trying to stop Dent from killing\nhis family. Dent explains his new philosophy:\n\n> You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. You thought we\n> could lead by example. You thought the rules could be bent but not\n> break\u2026^[2](#fn:fn1)^ you were wrong. The world is cruel. And the only\n> morality in a cruel world is chance. Unbiased. Unprejudiced. *Fair.*\n\nThroughout the film, we\u2019ve seen various desperate attempts to change the\nsystem by ignoring the usual rules: Batman originally thought he could\ninspire change by being a cultural exemplar, but only ended up causing a\nbunch of kids to get themselves hurt by dressing up as him. Dent thought\nhe could clean up the system by pushing righteously from the inside, but\nended up cutting more and more ethical corners until his own personal\nobsessions ended up making him a monster. The Joker had by far the most\ninteresting plan: he hoped to out-corrupt the corrupters, to take their\nplace and give the city \u201ca better class of criminal\u201d.\n\nAnd the crazy thing is that it works! At the end of the movie, the Joker\nis alive, the gangsters and their money launderers are mostly dead, and\ntheir money has been redistributed (albeit though the deflationary\nmethod of setting it on fire). And, as we see from the beginning of the\nthird movie, this is a fairly stable equilibrium: with politicians no\nlonger living in fear of the gangsters, they\u2019re free to adopt tough\nanti-crime policies that keep them from rising again.^[3](#fn:f)^\n\nThe movie concludes by emphasizing that Batman must become the villain,\nbut as usual it never stops to notice that the Joker is actually the\nhero. But even though his various games only have one innocent casualty,\nhe\u2019s much too crazy to be a viable role model for Batman. His inspired\nchaos destroys the criminals, but it also terrorizes the population.\nThanks to Batman, society doesn\u2019t devolve into a self-interested war of\nall-against-all, as he apparently expects it to, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nanyone enjoys the trials.\n\nThus Master Wayne is left without solutions. Out of options, it\u2019s no\nwonder the series ends with his staged suicide.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  I\u2019m actually not sure which game this is supposed to be.

And, like anyone with such a weighty responsibility,\nthey sometimes want a break: a chance to see a movie or eat out with\ntheir spouse.\n\nKids always make these things difficult, so in the late 1950s someone\nthought of starting a Capitol Hill Babysitting Coop. The idea was\nsimple: a bunch of families would get together and dole out scrip \u2014\nlittle fake money \u2014 amongst themselves.

And so, over the years, the amount of scrip in\ncirculation fell. Soon scrip was in short supply and people begun\nhoarding theirs for fear of losing it forever. There were few\nopportunities to babysit (and thus earn scrip) so people didn\u2019t want to\nlose the scrip they had by paying it to a sitter. Which, of course,\nmeant even fewer babysitting opportunities, making more people want to\nhoard their scrip, and on and on in a downward spiral.\n\nSince the coop consisted largely of lawmakers and lawyers, they\nattempted a legislative solution to the crisis, requiring everyone go\nout at least once every six months. The proposal just made things worse.\nEventually, someone tried the idea of handing out more scrip to\neveryone, and soon, the coop\u2019s delicate balance was restored.\n\n* * * * *\n\n![Book cover: Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not\nBust](image1_depressions)\n\nIn the 2000s, house prices started rising and everyone started sinking\ntheir money into them. Average people would buy houses and mortgage\nthem, banks would buy mortgages, investors would buy mortgage\nderivatives from banks, and so on. Pundits published books with titles\nlike *Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust* and many people just\nassumed housing prices would go up forever. At the peak of it, we had\nroughly \\$80 trillion in global financial assets.\n\nOf course, it was clear to anyone who looked closely that this couldn\u2019t\ngo on forever \u2014 and that when it stopped, it would bring a lot down with\nit. And, sure enough, today housing prices are almost back to their\nusual level and we now have only \\$60 trillion.\n\nJust like people taking scrip out of the babysitting coop, an enormous\namount of money has been taken out of the economy. So naturally people\nwant to hold on to what\u2019s left. So they don\u2019t spend their money, which\nmeans there\u2019s less employment opportunities, which means more people\nwant to hold on to their money, and on and on in a downward spiral.\n\nNormally when this happens, as in a recession, the government has an\neasy solution: lower interest rates. What happens is the country\u2019s\nleading bankers meet at the Federal Reserve and vote to lower interest\nrates. Let\u2019s say they decide to lower them (as they\u2019ve done a lot\nlately). Then the Federal Reserve Bank in New York starts buying up\nTreasury Bills (government IOUs) for cash, injecting money into the\neconomy. This allows banks to lend out more money, lowering the interest\nrate at which money is lent out, and thus encouraging people to start\nspending again. (Later, when the economy is doing well, they\u2019ll raise\nthe rates again, pulling money out and making sure things don\u2019t get out\nof hand.)\n\nBut this isn\u2019t simply a recession. The Fed\u2019s lowered the interest rate\nto zero \u2014 *zero!* they\u2019re giving money away \u2014 and unemployment just\nkeeps rising. Losing a quarter of global financial assets hurts. But now\nthe Fed has a problem: it can\u2019t lower the interest rate anymore.\nInterest rates don\u2019t go any lower than zero.\n\nWhich means, as J. M. Keynes foresaw back during the first Great\nDepression, we need another way of getting money into the economy. This\nisn\u2019t rocket science \u2014 Keynes suggested stuffing bills into bottles and\nburying them down mineshafts; Milton Friedman once proposed tossing cash\nout of helicopters. But as long as the government is spending money, we\nmight as well spend it on something useful. And thus, fiscal stimulus.\n\nWe spend the money to build roads and trains and high-speed Internet\nconnections. We give away health care and hand out welfare checks and\nmail people tax rebates. We do whatever it takes to get more money into\nthe economy. Which people then turn around and spend on all the things\nthey normally start spending money on and the engine of capitalism once\nagain start to turn.\n\n* * * * *\n\nKeynes\u2019 genius came in seeing that the Depression wasn\u2019t a moral\nproblem. We\u2019re not being punished for our exuberance or our stinginess,\njust as the folks on Capitol Hill weren\u2019t at fault for not wanting to go\nout. In both cases, the problem wasn\u2019t legislative, but merely\ntechnical: there just wasn\u2019t enough money to go around. And the\ntechnical problem has a technical solution: print more money.\n\nThe moralists insist it\u2019s irresponsible for us to just print more money.\nAfter all, they say, debt got us into this mess; is more debt really\ngoing to get us out? This is what they told FDR, causing him to hit the\nbreak on a recovery that was pulling us out of the Great Depression.\nThis is what they told Japan, ending their recovery and plunging the\ncountry into a \u201clost decade\u201d of unemployment.\n\nIt\u2019s not irresponsible to spend money; it\u2019s irresponsible not to.\nFactories are lying idle, people are sitting at home unemployed, and our\neconomy is slowing. We can spend money to make use of it all, or we can\njust continue downward spiral. The choice is ours.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFurther reading:\n\n-   Sweeney and Sweeney, \u201c[Monetary Theory and the Great Capitol Hill\n    Baby Sitting Co-op\n    Crisis](http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~kildegac/Courses/M&B/Sweeney%20&%20Sweeney.pdf)\u201d\n    [PDF]\n-   DeLong, \u201c[The Financial Crisis of 2007-2009: Understanding Its\n    Causes, Consequences\u2014and Its Possible\n    Cures](http://www.scribd.com/doc/9719227/null)\u201d [scribd]\n-   Krugman, *[The Return of Depression\n    Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393071014)*\n-   Baker, [Why Stimulus Won\u2019t Increase the\n    Debt](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=mankiw_promulgates_confusion_o#111235)\n\n\n[image1_depressions]: image1_depressions.jpg", "external_links": ["http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~kildegac/Courses/M&B/Sweeney%20&%20Sweeney.pdf", "http://www.scribd.com/doc/9719227/null", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393071014", "http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=mankiw_promulgates_confusion_o#111235"], "time": 1233734400.0, "postid": "depressions", "internal_links": []}, "namedropping": {"post_title": "Namedropping", "tags": [], "post_content": "Namedropping\n============\n\nJuly 20, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/namedropping)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI was having tea the other day with Nancy Pelosi, when she got a call\nfrom her good friend Tom Hanks.

(It has since been pointed out to me that one of the\nsecrets of successful people is that they try a lot of projects and then\nyou only see the successes. So perhaps this is not as bad a strategy as\nI initially thought.) Now that the year has come to a close, I thought I\nwould review the projects I mentioned there and see how they were doing.\n\n[Open Library](http://demo.openlibrary.org/): Moderate success. Open\nLibrary has a team of six or so people working on it. It\u2019s not\nprogressing as quickly as I would like, but it is progressing. The demo\nsite has launched and there are no big hurdles in our path. Personally,\nI\u2019ve learned an enormous amount about managing projects.\n\nMemoir: Failed. At the end of last year, I planned to start this year to\ntake a week to write a memoir of life at Reddit. The writing proceeded\non schedule but towards the middle of the week I fell terribly ill,\nrealized I would not be happy with the resulting book, and reluctantly\nabandoned it. Why did it fail? There were lots of mid-level reasons (I\u2019m\nnot that interesting a subject, my memory of the period was poor, I was\ndoing it with impure motives) but the fundamental one was that I just\ndid not honestly believe a memoir of my time at Reddit was a book that\nwas worth reading. I only lost a couple days, so this was not a\ndevastating failure.\n\nPsychology book: On hold. After the Reddit book, I begun researching and\noutlining a book about the highlights of psychology. I am still\ninterested in this book and think about it a fair amount, but I put the\nproject on hold after I started work on Open Library.\n\nAnother book: Unknown. In the other post I said I was working on three\nbooks. I can\u2019t remember what the third one is now. I think about\ndifferent books a lot but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve pursued any others very\nseriously.\n\nConsult on Berkeley [Big Ideas](http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/): Failed.\nI had no big ideas for helping this project and I did not follow through\non finding any. I had made no strong commitments, so I do not consider\nthis a serious failure.\n\n[JobBook](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/30/jobbookorg-up-and-running/):\nIntermediate. An initial site is launched but I have not spent a lot of\ntime on it nor is it progressing rapidly. Other people are pursuing it,\nthough, so I feel less pressure.\n\n[Science That Matters](http://sciencethatmatters.com/): Intermediate.\nThis site has launched and a fair number of posts have been written, but\nit hasn\u2019t been updated in a while and nobody else has really joined\nseriously. But the site hasn\u2019t been officially abandoned, so it\u2019s not a\ntotal failure.\n\n[Jottit](http://jottit.com/?partner=aaronsw): Moderate success. The site\nwas finished and launched and got incredibly positive reviews but hasn\u2019t\nreally caught fire with traffic yet. Perhaps this is because it\u2019s a\ngreat product that no one wants to use or perhaps we simply haven\u2019t\nfigured out how to market it yet. (If you want to try to market it,\ncontact [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com).)\n\nStatful: Intermediate. This was a project I mentored for Summer of Code\nto allow for better web stats visualization. I was a fairly bad mentor,\nin retrospect. A fair amount of the coding got done for this project but\nI did not have a clear design in place ahead of time so the software is\nnot especially usable. If any readers want to help work on the design\nfor a free software web stats analyzer (you know, something that will\ntell you who\u2019s visiting your site) please email\n[me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com). I still think the project is\nfinishable but it certainly has languished for a while.\n\n[Seddit](http://seddit.revision1.net/): Failure. This was the other\nSummer of Code project. The code got written but not tested or launched\nand has since languished. The schedule budgeted time for launching the\nproject but apparently not enough. I think the lesson here is that in\nsuch projects launching should be done first and features added later,\nso that whatever results is usable. Also, I should be a better mentor.\n\nGmail clone: Failure. I got a couple of people started working on this\nproject but I didn\u2019t follow through because I felt too overloaded.\nHowever, people have since pointed me to\n[Posterity](http://posterity.edgewall.org/) and\n[Sup](http://sup.rubyforge.org/). Again, the consequences weren\u2019t too\nbad. I wasted some people\u2019s time, but not an enormous amount.\n\nBook reader: Intermediate. I finished 70% of this but never launched it.\nJust never got around to it. The same was true of a number of other web\nprojects.\n\n[Journalism](http://aaronsw.jottit.com/writings): Success. I had two\narticles published for money and a third is on its way to the editor.\n\n[Paper](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/whowriteswikipedia/): Intermediate.\nPlagued by difficulties, the paper has been teetering on the brink of\nfailure for another year. I think a big problem was not having a partner\nwho had enough time to push me about it more.\n\n[Novel](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity): Intermediate. I had\nto stop working on the novel when I got sick but I mostly did it on time\nwhen I was OK and a shocking number of people seemed to actually read\nit. I will try to finish it early this year.\n\nAll in all, I think it was a fairly mixed year project-wise. A couple\nminor failures, a couple minor successes, and a couple big projects\nwhere time will tell. In truth, it may be too soon to evaluate this\nyear. If Open Library becomes a big success, this year will have been\nwell worthwhile. Otherwise, its legacy will be more mixed.\n", "external_links": ["http://demo.openlibrary.org/", "http://bigideas.berkeley.edu/", "http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/30/jobbookorg-up-and-running/", "http://sciencethatmatters.com/", "http://jottit.com/?partner=aaronsw", "mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://seddit.revision1.net/", "http://posterity.edgewall.org/", "http://sup.rubyforge.org/", "http://aaronsw.jottit.com/writings"], "time": 1199260800.0, "postid": "projects2007", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/interruptdriven", "http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/whowriteswikipedia/", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bubblecity"]}, "lastgoodbyes": {"post_title": "Last Goodbyes", "tags": [], "post_content": "Last Goodbyes\n=============\n\nJune 19, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/lastgoodbyes)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s minutes to midnight and I\u2019m hurriedly packing.

I\u2019ve spent a lot\nof the last few weeks lying in bed and drinking fluids. (With occasional\nbreaks to play Rock Band, much to the annoyance of my neighbors.) Once\nagain, I\u2019ve been sick \u2014 this time, with four different illnesses.\n\nI have a lot of illnesses. I don\u2019t talk about it much, for a variety of\nreasons. I feel ashamed to have an illness. (It sounds absurd, but there\nstill is an enormous stigma around being sick.) I don\u2019t want to use\nbeing ill as an excuse. (Although I sometimes wonder how much more\nproductive I\u2019d be if I wasn\u2019t so sick.) And, to a large extent, I just\ndon\u2019t find it an interesting subject. (My friends are amazed by this;\nwhy is such a curious person so uncurious about the things so directly\naffecting his life?)\n\nOne of my goals for this blog is to describe what it\u2019s like to be in\nvarious situations and it struck me that I\u2019ve never said much about what\nit\u2019s like to be sick. So I figured I\u2019d try to remedy that.\n(Unfortunately, being sick has made this slightly more difficult. I\nstarted this post on thanksgiving and now it\u2019s almost four days later.)\n\n**Cold:** All the time I feel tired and woozy. My throat is sore and I\u2019m\nconstantly searching for kleenex to address my nose. Sometimes I feel\ntoo hot, like I\u2019m burning up. I\u2019m always thirsty. Concentrating on\nanything is difficult. I just feel kind of wasted.\n\n**Upset stomach:** Huge pains grind through my stomach, like it\u2019s trying\nto leap out of my body. Food is always followed by pain, followed by\nrunning to the bathroom. I\u2019m afraid to go out because I wouldn\u2019t want to\nget too far from a toilet. I\u2019m always thirsty and the dehydration makes\nme angry and confused. At times the pain is excruciating and even after\nit goes I spend some time just reeling from it.\n\n**Migraine:** Ever felt someone\u2019s nails dig into your scalp? Imagine\nthat their nails are knives and they\u2019re scratching thru your brain and\nyou can begin to imagine what a migraine feels like. Light, sound, touch\n\u2014 everything makes it worse, making the most painful pains even more\npainful. Even when you quell it with a pill, you still end up feeling\nwoozy and disconnected, as if the pill is just barely keeping the pain\nat bay.\n\n**Depressed mood:** Surely there have been times when you\u2019ve been sad.\nPerhaps a loved one has abandoned you or a plan has gone horribly awry.\nYour face falls. Perhaps you cry. You feel worthless. You wonder whether\nit\u2019s worth going on. Everything you think about seems bleak \u2014 the things\nyou\u2019ve done, the things you hope to do, the people around you. You want\nto lie in bed and keep the lights off. Depressed mood is like that, only\nit doesn\u2019t come for any reason and it doesn\u2019t go for any either. Go\noutside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and you don\u2019t\nfeel any better, only more upset at being unable to feel the joy that\neveryone else seems to feel. Everything gets colored by the sadness.\n\nAt best, you tell yourself that your thinking is irrational, that it is\nsimply a mood disorder, that you should get on with your life. But\nsometimes that is worse. You feel as if streaks of pain are running\nthrough your head, you thrash your body, you search for some escape but\nfind none. And this is one of the more moderate forms. [As George\nScialabba put\nit](http://www.bu.edu/agni/essays-reviews/print/2003/57-scialabba.html),\n\u201cacute depression does not feel like falling ill, it feels like being\ntortured \u2026 the pain is not localized; it runs along every nerve, an\nunconsuming fire. \u2026 Even though one knows better, one cannot believe\nthat it will ever end, or that anyone else has ever felt anything like\nit.\u201d\n\nThe economist Richard Layard, after advocating that the goal of public\npolicy should be to maximize happiness, set out to learn what the\ngreatest impediment to happiness was today. His conclusion: depression.\nDepression causes nearly half of all disability, it affects one in six,\nand explains more current unhappiness than poverty. And (important for\npublic policy) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy has a short-term success\nrate of 50%. Sadly, depression (like other mental illnesses, especially\naddiction) is not seen as \u201creal\u201d enough to deserve the investment and\nawareness of conditions like breast cancer (1 in 8) or AIDS (1 in 150).\nAnd there is, of course, the shame.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSo I hope you\u2019ll forgive me for not doing more.

I haven\u2019t gotten very far, but it seems to me to\nbe a horribly muddled book, wrong on just about every point. So perhaps\nthis will be an ongoing series where I debunk the book in sequence. I\napologize to my readers if these posts seem obvious and not very\ninteresting. That\u2019s because I think the situations Parfit discusses are\nactually quite simple and it\u2019s only his muddled terminology that makes\nthem seem tricky.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify Parfit\u2019s discussion of self-defeating theories, which\nreally comes down to a discussion about credible commitments. For\nsimplicity, imagine there is no interest or inflation and your only goal\nin life is to maximize how much money you have. Thus an act is rational\niff it contributes to that goal.\n\nCase 1: There are two buttons. SUBTRACT removes \\$1000 from your bank\naccount, ADD adds \\$5000 to your bank account. Obviously it is rational\nto press ADD and irrational to press SUBTRACT.\n\nCase 2: There is one button, BOTH, which does both at the same time.\nObviously it is rational to press BOTH, since it results in a net gain\nof \\$4000.\n\nCase 3: There is a different button, DELAY, which adds \\$5000 to your\nbank account today and then removes \\$1000 in exactly one week. (DELAY\nis a weird button \u2014 to prevent you from using it twice at the same time,\nit stays down for the whole week and only pops back up once the \\$1000\nis removed.) Obviously it is rational to press DELAY since it too\nresults in a net gain of \\$4000.\n\nCase 4: There are two buttons: DELAY, which is the same as before, and\nEVADE, which changes your bank account number so that none of the other\nbuttons work. You can only press each button once and they have no other\nconsequences. It is rational to press DELAY and then EVADE, for a net\ngain of \\$5000.\n\nWhen is it rational to press EVADE? Only when you don\u2019t expect to be\nable to press DELAY ever again. (EVADE gains you at most \\$1000, while\nDELAY gains you at least \\$4000.) If you could press DELAY twice, would\nit be rational to hit EVADE after the first press? Of course not, it\u2019d\ncost you at least \\$4000. But Parfit seems to suggest one is acting\nrationally irrationally by not pressing it. The notion seems\nnonsensical.\n\nCase 5: Same two buttons, except after you press the DELAY button it\nengages a little impenetrable metal cover that physically prevents you\nfrom pressing EVADE. It\u2019s rational to press DELAY. Then it\u2019s rational to\npress EVADE, but that\u2019s kind of irrelevant, because it\u2019s also\nimpossible.\n\nCase 6: Same as 5, except it injects you with a serum that prevents you\nfrom pressing EVADE. Again, it\u2019s rational to press DELAY and then\nrational but impossible to press EVADE.\n\nI don\u2019t see a big difference between these two cases, but Parfit seems\nto think the difference is vital.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the fact that another person is involved that leads to the\ncomplications?\n\nCase 7: Same as 4, except the \\$1000 goes into Bob\u2019s account and only\nBob can press DELAY. Bob has the same notion of rationality as you and\nthus will only press DELAY if he believes you will not press EVADE. You\ncould promise not to press it, but it would be irrational for you to\nkeep that promise so Bob rightly does not believe it. However, it would\nbe rational for you to engage the impenetrable cover or take the serum\nthat prevents you from pressing EVADE.\n\nThere is no rational irrationality. Your goal of maximizing your money\nis not self-defeating. This all seems like the most obvious, unarguable\nstuff in the world. So I don\u2019t see why Parfit is so confused about it.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1277967600.0, "postid": "parfit1", "internal_links": []}, "fatbacklash": {"post_title": "Fat Backlash", "tags": [], "post_content": "Fat Backlash\n============\n\nMay 7, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fatbacklash)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*They told me exercise and diet\\\n If I would try it, would cure my ills\\\n But though I\u2019m already past my quota\\\n I want another load o\u2019 those magic pills*\\\n \u2014 They Might Be Giants, \u201c[Renew My\nSubscription](http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/Renew_My_Subscription)\u201d\n\nThe response to [my suggestion that there might be a simple and painless\nway to lose weight](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/miraclediet) brought\nsome interesting responses.

And yet, as these writers clearly know, obesity is,\nas I understand it, an epidemic in this country. So this supposed\nsolution clearly isn\u2019t working. Yes, it might work in the sense that if\neveryone followed it they\u2019d be fine (although even that is somewhat\nunclear), but plainly it\u2019s too hard to follow. If our goal is to\nactually stop obesity, then we\u2019re failing.\n\nBut I suspect for some people, that isn\u2019t the goal. And Martijn\u2019s last\nsentence hints at this. In [my last\npiece](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fatfuture) I drew an analogy\nbetween being poor and being fat. And I think this rage at an easy way\nto lose weight parallels the rage we see at \u201cgovernment handouts\u201d that\nprovide an \u201ceasy way out\u201d of being poor.\n\n(To be clear, I\u2019m talking about people who are opposed to easy ways to\nlose weight in general; not the people who were skeptical about this\ndiet in particular or sick of fad diets altogether. Such reactions are\nperfectly right and reasonable.)\n\nThis is one thing I didn\u2019t really predict in my last piece on the\nsubject, but undoubtedly such far-reaching changes will also have their\nbacklash. People who have spent their whole lives putting themselves\nthrough the pain of starvation and strenuous exercise to maintain their\nphysique are undoubtedly going to be a little upset to figure out it was\nall unnecessary. It would be bad enough if it was some new invention\nthat made fat disappear \u2014 after all, it hadn\u2019t been invented yet when\nthey\u2019d gone through all that so there was no way they could take\nadvantage of it. But olive oil and sugar water? That\u2019s been around\nforever! How could they have missed it?\n\nRonald Reagan got elected campaigning against imaginary \u201cwelfare queens\u201d\nin supposed-Cadillacs. Will right-wing politicians of the future rail\nagainst those who take the easy way out of being fat?\n\nOne major difference is that economics is at least thought to be a\nzero-sum game. Those welfare queens are taking \u201c*your money*\u201d, in the\nform of taxes. But you lose nothing if more people get thin. By the same\ntoken, there\u2019s not a whole lot the government can do about this problem.\nThe welfare payments were theirs, so they could cut them (as Clinton\nsavagely did) but what\u2019s the government going to do about the diet? Ban\nolive oil?\n\nPerhaps instead we\u2019ll see social pressure. The major visible difference\nbetween someone on the diet and someone who isn\u2019t (considering that the\nolive oil can be taken in private) is that someone who\u2019s on the diet\nsimply doesn\u2019t eat much. But eating is a major social function, around\nwhich much business and friendship is conducted. Perhaps backlash\nmembers will heap scorn on those who skip lunch or eat little, perhaps\neven ostracizing them until they start eating like normal (and thus\nweakening the effects of the diet).\n\nI\u2019ve seen a little bit of this myself \u2014 as a supertaster, my tastes are\nsufficiently strange that when eating with new people I\u2019m often asked\nabout my choice of food and then queried and lightly mocked for my\nexplanation. It\u2019s not so bad and I\u2019m sure people mean perfectly well by\nit, but it is a cost and if people are actually angry about the diet, it\nmay get worse.\n\nSo while actually being fat may go away easily, the stigma might be a\nlittle harder to erase.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.tmbw.net/wiki/index.php/Renew_My_Subscription"], "time": 1146985200.0, "postid": "fatbacklash", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/miraclediet", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fatfuture"]}, "clichefinder": {"post_title": "Cliche Finder", "tags": [], "post_content": "Cliche Finder\n=============\n\nDecember 22, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/clichefinder)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt\u2019s not an essay, but I hope I can count it as a blog post.

I had been researching various topics \u2014 law, politics,\nthe media \u2014 and become more and more convinced that something was\nseriously wrong. Politicians, I was shocked to discover, weren\u2019t\nactually doing what the people wanted. And the media, my research found,\ndidn\u2019t really care much about that, preferring to focus on such things\nas posters and polls.\n\nAs I thought about this more, its implications struck me as larger and\nlarger. But I still had no bigger picture to fit them in. The media was\nsimply doing a bad job, leading people to be confused. We just had to\npressure them to do better and democracy would be restored.\n\nThen, one night, I watched the film *Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky\nand the Media* (I think it had come up in my Netflix queue). First off,\nit\u2019s simply an amazingly-good film. I\u2019ve watched it several times now\nand each time I\u2019m utterly entranced. It\u2019s undoubtedly the best\ndocumentary I\u2019ve seen, weaving together all sorts of clever tricks to\nenlighten and entertain.\n\nSecond, it makes shocking points. I didn\u2019t understand all of what it was\nsaying at the time, but I understood enough to realize that something\nwas severely amiss. The core of the film is a case study of Indonesia\u2019s\nbrutal invasion of the country of East Timor. The US personally gave the\ngreen light to the invasion and provided the weapons, which allowed\nIndonesia to massacre the population in an occupation that, per capita,\nranks with the Holocaust. And the US media ignores it and when they do\ncover it, inevitably distorts it.\n\nShocked and puzzled by the film, I was eager to learn more. Noam Chomsky\nhas dozens of books but I was fortunate to choose to read *Understanding\nPower*, a thick paperback I picked up at the library. Edited by Peter\nMitchell and John Schoeffel, two public defenders in New York, the book\nis a collection of transcripts of group discussions with Chomsky.\n\nChomsky lays out the facts in a conversational style, telling stories\nand explaining things in response to questions from the groups, covering\nan incredibly wide range of topics. And on every single one, what he\ntells you is completely shocking, at odds with everything you know,\nturning the way you see things upside-down. Mitchell and Schoeffel know\nyou\u2019re unlikely to believe these things, so they\u2019ve carefully footnoted\nand documented every claim, providing blockquote excerpts from the\noriginal sources to establish them.\n\nEach story, individually, can be dismissed as some weird oddity, like\nwhat I\u2019d learned about the media focusing more on posters than on\npolicy. But seeing them all together, you can\u2019t help but begin to tease\nout the larger picture, to ask yourself what\u2019s behind all these\ndisparate things, and what that means for the way we see the world.\n\nReading the book, I felt as if my mind was rocked by explosions. At\ntimes the ideas were too much that I literally had to lie down. (I\u2019m not\nthe only one to feel this way \u2014 Norman Finkelstein noted that when he\nwent through a similar experience, \u201cIt was a totally crushing experience\nfor me. \u2026 My world literally caved in. And there were quite a number of\nweeks where \u2026 I just was in bed, totally devastated.\u201d) I remember\nvividly clutching at the door to my room, trying to hold on to something\nwhile the world spun around.\n\nFor weeks afterwards, everything I saw was in a different light. Every\ntime I saw a newspaper or magazine or person on TV, I questioned what I\nthought knew about them, wondered how they fit into this new picture.\nQuestions that had puzzled me for years suddenly began making sense in\nthis new world. I reconsidered everyone I knew, everything I thought I\u2019d\nlearned. And I found I didn\u2019t have much company.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me two years to write about this experience, not without\nreason. One terrifying side effect of learning the world isn\u2019t the way\nyou think is that it leaves you all alone. And when you try to describe\nyour new worldview to people, it either comes out sounding unsurprising\n(\u201cyeah, sure, everyone knows the media\u2019s got problems\u201d) or like pure\nlunacy and people slowly back away.\n\nEver since then, I\u2019ve realized that I need to spend my life working to\nfix the shocking brokenness I\u2019d discovered. And the best way to do that,\nI concluded, was to try to share what I\u2019d discovered with others. I\ncouldn\u2019t just tell them it straight out, I knew, so I had to provide the\nhard evidence. So I started working on a book to do just that. (I\u2019m\nlooking for people to help, if you\u2019re interested.)\n\nIt\u2019s been two years now and my mind has settled down some. I\u2019ve learned\na bunch more but, despite my best efforts, haven\u2019t found any problems\nwith this frightening new world view. After all this time, I\u2019m finally\nready to talk about what happened with some distance and I hope I\u2019m now\nable to begin work on my book in earnest.\n\nIt was a major change, but I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything.\n\n-   [*Understanding Power* on\n    Amazon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565847032)\n-   [The *Understanding Power* web site](http://understandingpower.com/)\n-   [*Manufacturing Consent* DVD on\n    Amazon](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B00005Y726)\n-   [*Manufacturing Consent*\n    torrent](http://www.torrentspy.com/torrent/341194/Manufacturing_Consent_Noam_Chomsky_and_the_Media_1993_DVD_Rip_avi)\n-   [companion book](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1551640023)\n\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565847032", "http://understandingpower.com/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B00005Y726", "http://www.torrentspy.com/torrent/341194/Manufacturing_Consent_Noam_Chomsky_and_the_Media_1993_DVD_Rip_avi", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1551640023"], "time": 1147676400.0, "postid": "epiphany", "internal_links": []}, "lazybackup": {"post_title": "Lazy Backup", "tags": [], "post_content": "Lazy Backup\n===========\n\nNovember 29, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/lazybackup)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing good UI designers know, it\u2019s that the best UI is\nnot to have one at all.

Adults run examinations and programs, try to be\n\u201chip\u201d to teen culture, but ultimately, we must admit, we have little\nidea what really goes on, making it easy for rumors to run wild.\n\nJeremy Iversen and Rebekah Nathan decided to see for themselves what\nschool life was really like, by going undercover and experiencing it\nthemselves. While they went to different places, in different guises, in\nentirely different situations (Iversen was a senior in high school,\nwhile Nathan was a freshman in college), the pictures they draw are\nstartlingly similar: a world where genuine education is absolutely the\nlast thing on everyone\u2019s mind.\n\n* * * * *\n\nJeremy Iversen grew up in New York, attended a prestigious boarding\nschool, and went to college at Stanford. But, he says, life after school\ndidn\u2019t have the same appeal. So he decided to go back and get the\ntypical high school education he never had. The result \u2014 *High School\nConfidential* \u2014 is a gripping memoir of what life is actually like for\nthe cool kids in a southern California high school.\n\nThe general outlines are perhaps less than shocking to those who have\nbeen paying attention. High school kids routinely have casual sex with\neach other, for example. (\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to do in this town,\u201d one\nstudent comments, \u201cexcept start drama with everybody.\u201d) They take drugs\n\u2014 marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, speed \u2014 right under their parents noses.\n(In one scene, Travis, the class\u2019s drug dealer, and Alexis, his sister,\nare confronted by their father. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a drug test,\u201d he\nwarns them. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been clean since nursery!\u201d Travis replies. \u201cOh,\nit\u2019s only your sister I\u2019m worried about,\u201d explains the father.) The kids\ncheat, not just by copying on tests, but by taking copious steroids and\nhuman growth hormone to compete in sports. (\u201cI read an article about\nhigh school steroid use in *Sports Illustrated*\u201d, comments the team\ncoach, as the kids who are using look away. \u201cGood thing that\u2019s not a\nproblem in our school.\u201d)\n\nDespite living in a very diverse community, many of the kids are full of\ncasual racism and right-wing politics (white people need to stand up for\ntheir heritage, nuke all the Arabs), although they\u2019re far more liberal\nin practice (doing drugs with their Middle Eastern friends). When they\nget mad at each other, they aren\u2019t afraid to take it out in violent\nbrawls. And when the school throws parties, everybody gets totally\nhammered. (There\u2019s a brilliant scene where some kids throw up on Richard\nNixon\u2019s grave.)\n\nHowever, the novel is gripping in its details, with more amusing\ncharacters and fascinating stories than any television show imitation of\nhigh school life. The teachers are such characters that were this\nfiction you might accuse them of being overwritten. School events are so\nlavish (a band performs every day at lunch, large coordinated\ndance-and-light shows are done for spirit rallies) that they seem like\nTV exaggerations. School assignments are so inane (cut apart this cat)\nthat you might think the kid telling you this was exaggerating. But\nIversen was there, the dialogue in the book is copied down verbatim, the\ndescription of events was taken first-hand.^[1](#fn:1)^\n\nAnd, indeed, the most shocking components are not the tales of the kids,\nbut of the schools. Iversen draws a picture of an institution that is\nnot just failing at learning, but antithetical to it. Thea, the only\ngirl in the book with any academic passion, is routinely discouraged by\nthe actions of both peers and adults. But no other student even gets\nthat far. The school\u2019s student culture makes caring about class\nunthinkable; the school\u2019s classes make learning near-impossible.\n\nBut the grandest component of Iversen\u2019s tale is how he dismantles our\nprevious methods for trying to understand how schools operate. First,\nthere is Derrick, the school board\u2019s secret weapon. Derrick is an\narticulate and popular student, admired by all, and elected class\npresident. But it slowly becomes clear that student government,\nincluding him, is nothing but the administration\u2019s pawn. The regulations\nare designed to make genuine complaints impossible to bring before the\nadministration, while the administration uses Derrick at every\nopportunity as a mouthpiece for their lies about what the children\nreally think. Thus the only student representative most outside adults\nsee is no representative at all.\n\nThen there are the standards regulations, around which the curriculum is\nsupposedly organized. The state school accreditation team is coming to\nverify that it is, and the adults worry that they\u2019re quite likely to\nfail. So the principal goes all-out, bribing, threatening, and faking\nthe school into appearing good. Any kid who ever caused a problem is\nlocked away in a hidden trailer for the duration of the inspector\u2019s\nvisit, every class is replaced with fake, scripted, standards-compliant\nmaterial. Every child puts on fake happy faces under severe duress. And\nthe school passes with flying colors. \u201cI wish every kid in the state\ncould have an education this good\u201d, insists the lead inspector.\n\nThe reality is that between adult and student, there is a vast gulf in\nmentality. Iversen\u2019s genius is that he can get us inside the heads of\nboth sides.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAround the same time, Rebekah Nathan, an anthropology professor at AnyU\n(both psuedonyms), was sitting in on some classes herself. She noticed\nthat simply by acting like a student \u2014 sitting in class, taking notes,\netc. \u2014 her fellow students began treating her like one, sharing gossip\nand trading facts she never got to see as a professor. Eager to cross\nthat same mental gulf, she decided to spend her sabbatical the following\nyear doing an undercover anthropological study of her own university.\n\nNathan enrolled as a freshman, lived in a dorm, and took a full load of\ncourses. Despite looking like a mom, the other students accepted her as\ntheir own. She probably couldn\u2019t get involved in the party scene and\ndidn\u2019t try \u2014 she stuck to studying the academic and intellectual side of\ncollege life \u2014 but pretty much everything she says fits with my\nimpressions as a freshman Stanford student around the same time and I\ncan even confirm a couple of her more surprising specific points.\n\nAfter confining her focus to the intellectual, Nathan discovers that\nthere simply isn\u2019t much there. Students have their own culture with\nregard to class, a language known as \u201cUndergraduate Cynical\u201d, where\nactually caring about the material is deeply frowned upon, and the only\nquestions you\u2019re permitted to ask of a teacher are about the details of\ngrading and assignments:\n\n> A good question, I learned, is one that voices a concern shared by\n> other students or that asks for clarifications of upcoming work. \u201cWill\n> there be more questions on the test from the text or the lecture?\u201d\n> \u201cShould the paper be double- or single- spaced?\u201d [\u2026]\n>\n> [\u2026] \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d is, incredibly, just not the kind of\n> question that an American college student would ask.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just show; students genuinely aren\u2019t engaged in classes. They\ndon\u2019t do the required reading, they dash off assignments, they ditch\nclasses, they cheat on tests. Some go up and talk to the teacher about\nthings, but they do so with ulterior motives in mind. Signs and talks\ngeared to incoming students explain that one must \u201cwork the teachers\u201d by\ntalking to them, getting them to recognize you so they will give you\nhints about tests and go easy on you when you need exceptions. \u201cI take\nthe information I need from the professor\u201d, one highly-successful\nstudent tells Nathan, explaining what that consists of: \u201chow they\u2019re\ngoing to grade you and what they think is important\u201d. Everything is seen\nas part of the game, not worthwhile for its own sake.\n\nBut it\u2019s all too easy to lament this sad state of student affairs,\nperhaps complain about the laziness of modern students. But Nathan goes\none step further: she shows *why* it is happening. For even she, a\nprofessor with a Ph.D, finds herself doing the exact same things. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t need to study those things, they won\u2019t be on the test\u201d, she tells\nher study partner Rob. It takes Rob, a fellow student, to ask her\nwhether she just cares about learning for its own sake.\n\nThe culture of Undergraduate Cynical, you see, is not created by student\nlaziness or a lack of concern for intellectual life. It\u2019s created by the\nnecessities of the schedule. Students simply don\u2019t have time to care.\nThey take three to five classes, each with separate sections and lab\nassignments, each with its own schedule of papers and readings and\nadults to suck up to. That alone is enough to drive Rebekah crazy,\ndespite her thinking she had pretty good time management skills juggling\nall her commitments as a professor. But on top of that most students go\nto activities and clubs, work an on- or off-campus job, party in the\nevenings, and try to maintain relationships. When you run the math,\nthere just isn\u2019t enough time to care.\n\nSo students instead focus on doing what\u2019s required of them: just\nscraping by. Anything that won\u2019t impact their grade much is tossed and a\ndesire to learn becomes a desire to pass. It\u2019s hard to imagine any\nsincere desire to learn surviving such a harried schedule. As soon as\nyou get engrossed or a book or topic, you have to dash off to your next\nmeeting.\n\nAgain, this is all something completely invisible to the professors.\nThey spend their days worrying about tomorrow\u2019s lecture and are shocked\nwhen students don\u2019t do the same. But the students haven\u2019t had time:\nthey\u2019ve had two more classes and who knows how many assignments in the\ninterim. And, anyway, they only picked this course because it filled a\nconvenient hole in their schedule, they\u2019re not even sure what it\u2019s\nabout.\n\nSo the students simply don\u2019t get engrossed, student discussion groups\ndon\u2019t actually discuss things, but instead each student simply makes up\na point of view and shares it so they don\u2019t get a zero on their in-class\nparticipation grade. There is no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d on any subject;\nthere are hardly any minds.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBoth books, their research being conducted undercover, will no doubt\nlead some to raise ethical questions. Jeremy Iversen had to deceive and\nmislead his fellow students \u2014 including creating a fake backstory \u2014 in\norder to experience life with them. Rebekah Nathan, while not explicitly\nlying, led students to believe she was just an older woman going back to\nschool, and certainly not one of their professors.\n\nBut deception alone is not an ethical violation. Psychology studies\nroutinely deceive subjects into thinking the experiment is about X, when\nactually it is about Y. (I myself have been so deceived.) The key\ndifference, and in my opinion the only possible ethical lapse on Iversen\nand Nathan\u2019s part, is that after the study is over, the psychologists\nexplain what was really going on. Neither Nathan nor Iversen told their\nfriends afterwards, leaving them only to discover it after the project\nhad gone public.\n\n(By contrast, Barbara Ehrenreich, in *Nickeled and Dimed*, her study of\nlow-wage work, told her fellow workers at the end that she was working\non a book about the experience. They were \u201cremarkably blas\u00e9\u201d about it,\nshe found.)\n\nBut more generally, important scientific projects like these might have\nto step on a few ethical toes. Some of the greatest experiments in\npsychology \u2014 the Milgram experiments on obedience to authority and\nZimbardo\u2019s Stanford Prison Experiment \u2014 were easy fodder for armchair\nethicists. But while people may have their feelings ruffled, in all of\nthese experiments there was little lasting hurt to the participants,\nwhile the educational consequences of the studies themselves have been\nimmense.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe real ethical question is how we can justify forcing our children\ninto such institutions of anti-intellectualism. Iversen found that high\nschool students were quite conservative politically, even more so than\ntheir parents, and perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that Bush\u2019s\nanti-intellectual charm appeals to kids who daily experience education\nas a form of torture.\n\nPerhaps students learn something by going through the necessary motions\nrequired to get a degree, but I defy anyone to read both of these\naccounts and continue to insist that schools are teaching kids to be\n\u201ccritical thinkers\u201d with a \u201clife-long love of learning\u201d. If anything,\nthe real education is in the opposite.\n\nInstead of critical thinkers, we have kids willing to accept any\nrequirement, no matter how absurd, without question. \u201cIf you write what\nyou want to that prof,\u201d explains a successful senior, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna end\nup with a bad grade. Whereas, if you write to *them*, you win\u2014you can\nstill have your own mindset and say, hell, I know this isn\u2019t the way I\nfeel, but I\u2019ll give them what they want.\u201d But, as experiments in\ncognitive dissonance have shown us, if one continues saying what one\ndoesn\u2019t feel, one begins feeling it before too long. It\u2019s easy to see\nhow this is effective training for professionalism, which actually means\ndoing what you\u2019re told, despite what you believe. But it\u2019s hard to see\nhow this system is going to generate students who will buck a trend.\n\nInstead of life-long learners, we have kids who learn that genuine\nlearning is a joke. \u201cEducation\u201d becomes that stupid thing in classrooms\nthat you have to do to get a decent job, an entirely mercenary\nperspective that\u2019s unhelpfully encouraged by the mercenary pressures of\nstudent loans. If the only education you\u2019ve ever experienced is doing\nwhat\u2019s necessary to get a good grade, why would you do it when the\ngrades weren\u2019t around?\n\nOur public high schools were supposed to make every child a good citizen\nof the democracy. Our great universities were supposed to show young\npeople our grandest achievements. One could say that these institutions\nare failing at their jobs, but it might be more accurate to say that\nthey\u2019re being all too successful.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* * * * *\n\n1.  Some of the more verbal students at the school, upset at being\n    hoodwinked by an undercover writer and disappointed at their\n    portrayal, have taken to posting nasty comments on web sites and in\n    the school paper suggesting that Iversen\u2019s book is fictionalized.\n    But, as far as I can see, everything they claim that he left out, he\n    actually included (with a single exception: one person on the\n    Internet claimed kids called him \u201cPlasticface\u201d) and they have failed\n    to dispute any details he included. So, while no doubt Iversen\u2019s\n    book contains errors (every book does, especially one as difficult\n    to write as this), I\u2019m compelled to believe it is largely\n    accurate.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:1)\n\n\n\n[image1_undercoverlearning]: image1_undercoverlearning.jpg\n[image2_undercoverlearning]: image2_undercoverlearning.jpg", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743283635", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0143037471", "#fn:1", "#fnref:1"], "time": 1160550000.0, "postid": "undercoverlearning", "internal_links": []}, "critmass": {"post_title": "Solidarity for the Shy: Achieving Critical Mass", "tags": [], "post_content": "Solidarity for the Shy: Achieving Critical Mass\n===============================================\n\nAugust 8, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/critmass)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe idea is simple: once a month, people meet up in the center of the\ncity with their bikes and then go on a ride through the city together,\ntaking over the streets through sheer numbers. There\u2019s little explicit\npolitics \u2014 with the exception of a distaste for \u201ccar culture\u201d \u2014 and no\nleaders or official organizers. The whole thing, the (unofficial)\nwebsite explains, is a \u201cxerocracy\u201d: pass out xeroxes of your proposal\nand maybe people will follow it. Sounds like fun.\n\nI finally got myself together enough to go this month and, half an hour\nbefore starting time, hopped on my bike and headed over. Unfortunately I\ndidn\u2019t look at the directions all that carefully and ended up getting\nlost in Boston. At one point I made a wrong turn and found myself\ntrapped in the middle of a major highway, facing the wrong direction,\nand with little opportunity to make it to the side. Somehow, though, I\nmanaged to escape.\n\nI got lost several more times and became increasingly frustrated with\nBoston\u2019s loopy street plan. Forget about being bike-friendly, this city\nisn\u2019t even car-friendly. As I repeatedly reversed my path, I figured I\nhad no doubt missed the event. Just as well, I figured, since my leg\nmuscles were aching from a heavy day of running yesterday and the sky\nwas so cloudy that rain seemed inevitable. Still, I figured, I should at\nleast try to find the location of the meetup for next time.\n\nI made sure to bring nothing with me save the key to my apartment (both\nfor aerodynamism and in case I got arrested \u2014 in New York, the police\nhave been known to harass and arrest CMers for \u201cparading without a\npermit\u201d) so I don\u2019t know what time I arrived, but I do know how my face\nlit up when I saw the mass of bicycles and cyclists arranged at the\npark, even as the wind was trying to blow me over.\n\nThe park was a small right triangle,taking up less than half the block.\nOn one side was a farmer\u2019s market, closing up shop for the day. On the\nother was a small protest about Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, with many\nwaving Lebanese flags and a speaker on a podium (whose voice was\namplified by portable radios his associates carried around the crowd)\ndiscussed the tragedy of the invasion. A fat balding man waved a sign\nreading \u201cModerate Muslims: Help US Fight Islamonazism\u201d, but things were\notherwise quite civil.\n\nFinally, on the hypotenuse, were the cyclists, just standing and\nchatting. By the time I\u2019d made my way over to them, I noticed they were\nbiking around in a circle together, so I joined in, smiling at the\nsight. We all biked around for a while until someone shouted \u201cMike, go\nright!\u201d Mike did, exiting onto the street, and the crowd followed.\n\nFor the most part, I tried to stay in the middle of the pack. Bikes rode\non all sides of me, while cars were stopped in their tracks. Frustrated,\nmany of them pounded on their horns. In response, the crowd imitated\ntheir honk, except shouting \u201cwoohoo\u201d as the noise, as if the cars were\ncheering them on.\n\nWe were particularly amused at the sight of a duck tour stopped in its\ntracks. I didn\u2019t catch what happened next, but from what I heard, the\nduck tour tried to break into the mass and ended up running right into\nthe car next to it, greatly amusing all the massers.\n\nBefore we started, I overheard someone discussing about how last time a\ncar tried to break into the mass as it was passing by. He said this no\nso much in anger but rather in amazement at the audacity of the idea. If\nthe mass had any opinions, it definitely felt that the street was\nrightly its.\n\nTo protect against future such incursions, a couple people with long\nbikes stood in front of cars at intersections, acting as human\nbarricades, then sprinting back to the front of the mass so they could\ndo it again. At one intersection, they even tried to placate the cars.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, we\u201d just be a second, just hold on one sec,\u201d they\nshouted too the cars, which the mass found hilarious.\n\nIt was probably just as well the cars stayed put. Once one managed to\nbreak into it the mass, but quickly found itself stymied, like a\nbewildered bear suddenly finding itself in the middle of a swarm of\nhoneybees.\n\nWhen cars asked what we were all doing, we responded that we\u2019d simply\ndecided to go out for a bike ride. When pedestrians asked, however, we\nshouted \u201cCritical Mass!\u201d Still, despite our vehiclism, some cars did\nexplicitly shout their support for Critical Mass.\n\nThroughout I\u2019ve been referring to the mass as a single entity, but it\ndidn\u2019t really feel like one. While there certainly were a lot of bikes,\nand together we formed quite an imposing swarm, but despite engaging it\na coordinated activity, we related mostly as individuals, most people\njust talking to the friends they\u2019d come with. For the most part, there\njust wasn\u2019t much to talk about. I was riding my weirdo bike, so a lot of\npeople said something like \u201csweet bike\u201d, but the conversation didn\u2019t go\nfar beyond \u201cdid you build it?\u201d Bikes were, perhaps, the only thing we\nhad in common. And even casual smalltalk seems exceedingly awkward in\nsuch a situation. American education, it has been said, is about\nlearning how to be alone in a crowd. Perhaps its not surprising then\nthat it also teaches how to be alone at a mass protest.\n\nThe group, however, did make some attempt at community. When some began\nfalling behind, they\u2019d shout \u201cmass up!\u201d encouraging the others to slow\ndown and catch up with the group. But this was more an issue of\npracticality than community, though, as a dispersed mass had less\neffect.\n\nWe winded around the city of Boston for a while. Cambridge is some\ncomplex and entertaining, and I\u2019m such a loner and stay-insider, that I\nrarely find myself across the river in Boston. That\u2019s probably a shame,\nbecause from what I see of it, the city\u2019s quite nice. I suppose I must\nhave been in the North End, which I gather is the nice neighborhood, but\nI didn\u2019t realize how much so. The streets turned into long promenades\nupon which men in dashing suits would dash and attractive women walked\ntheir dogs. The houses were intricate constructions of brick and, from\nthe outside at least, appeared exceedingly elegant. The whole scene\nreminded me of the expensive parts of Manhattan. A fancy shopping\ndistrict was just blocks away.\n\nAfter touring this part of the city, with so many twists and turns that\nI completely lost track of where we were, we turned up at the bridge to\nMIT. Storm clouds provided a backdrop to the horizon and as we crossed\nwe saw bolt of lightning come down from the clouds and connect with some\ntall building. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about getting my bike wet, but I\nfigured that as long as we were heading in the direction of my\napartment, I might as well continue on.\n\nWe rode up Mass Ave, Cambridge\u2019s main street, past a noticeably\nfriendlier crowd of passersby. By the time we\u2019d gotten half-way to\nHarvard Square though, the rain started coming down, very quickly\naccelerating to full sheets and then to buckets. The wind was blowing so\nhard that the rain drops attacked my face like darts, making my eyes\nsting. Even when I put my hand above my eyes for protection, they\nmanaged to work their way around it and straight into my eyeballs. In\nshort order, I quickly became soaked through and through. It was a good\nthing I brought nothing save those keys.\n\nThe massers, for the most part, embraced the rain, throwing their hands\nin the air and cheering. And, since I had nothing to worry about getting\nwet (except the bike, which had already been left out in the rain one\ntoo many times), I did the same. It was liberating.\n\nAs we passed Harvard Square, the rain started pouring down even harder,\nflooding the streets with water in which our bikes left beautiful\ntrails. We headed into a tunnel, screaming the entire length. Then we\nstopped at the firehouse at the end, waiting for the rest to catch up,\nuntil someone shouted \u201clet\u2019s go again!\u201d and we headed back into the\ntunnel in the other direction, again screaming. It was this point that\nwe began to turn around and head back to Boston, though by a circuitous\nroute I\u2019d never seen before and didn\u2019t quite understand. As we turned\naway from my apartment, I thought about taking this chance to make my\nexit and head home, but somehow riding home alone seemed more dangerous\nthat continuing on inside the protective bubble of the mass. So I\ncontinued. The rain quickly died down, to the annoyance of some riders.\n\u2018That\u2019s all you got?\u2019 one shouted. \u2018Come on!\u2019\n\nBy the time we got back to the bridge to Boston, I was feeling kind of\ntired and couldn\u2019t quite force myself to make it all the way up and, in\nany event, wasn\u2019t quite sure whether I should continue on with everyone.\nThe group had thinned significantly by this point, with people\npresumably peeling off as we passed their houses. I decided to save the\nfull tour for another time and turned around to head back home.\n\nDespite being physically tired and thoroughly soaked, I was exhilarated.\nIt was the most fun I\u2019d ever had on a bicycle, despite its oddities and\nflaws. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell my friends.\n\nAs I rode home, I apparently committed some traffic error, leading some\njerk in a car to shout \u2018Get the fuck off the road, you ass!\u2019 It didn\u2019t\nfaze me at all, though. \u2018Get the fuck off *my* road,\u2019 I thought.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1155020400.0, "postid": "critmass", "internal_links": []}, "femhosp": {"post_title": "A Feminist Goes to the Hospital", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Feminist Goes to the Hospital\n===============================\n\nSeptember 27, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/femhosp)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn *[A Pattern Language](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195019199)*,\nChristopher Alexander comments on the idiocy of trying to nurse people\nto health by locking them up in the land of the sick, but a visit to an\nactual hospital makes the point more vividly than logical argument ever\ncould. The modern hospital is a place of nightmares, even visiting I\ncannot manage to spend more than an hour here without beginning to go\ninsane. I cannot imagine how anyone ever escapes.\n\nAn island of white in an ocean of green, the modern hospital\u2019s\nlandscaping dangles the promise of verdant beauty while its insides are\nall white sterility. The hallways of identical doors twist and turn\naround so much that it\u2019s impossible to find any room that isn\u2019t\ncarefully numbered, even after several attempts to try to discern the\nbuilding\u2019s layout. The muted colors and dreary duplication do not reward\nsuch attempts at investigation, or even mere attempts at life.\n\nIt seems like the building itself is ill. Odd pieces are blocked off\nwith white sheets, larger ones with completely opaque walls. Bizarre\nmachines with large tubes line the hallways, apparently standing in for\nbroken parts of the building\u2019s innards, while workmen wander around\nattempting to treat the other symptoms.\n\nThe rooms themselves are monstrous cells, tiny boxes with doors that\nstay open and walls that fight any attempts at individuality or privacy.\nThe size makes entertaining guests awkward, while the lack of activities\nmakes loneliness unbearable.\n\nWere the large sign reading \u201cHospital\u201d to go missing, one might easily\nmistake the facility as one for torture: men whose clothes have been\nreplaced by dreary gowns slowly wander the halls in dreary stupor, their\nbattered faces making them appear as if they have been badly beaten.\nThey are not permitted to escape.\n\nWere one, under such amazing conditions, to try to mount an attempt at\nfruitful work, it would quickly fail. Even assuming one was able to\nmuster the energy to focus, the noises through the thin walls and\nunclosed doors would quickly distract. The beeps and buzzes from the\nassorted machinery would frustrate to no end. The screeching\nannouncements from the loudspeakers would fast derail any trains of\nthought. And if one manages to get past all these things, well, it will\nonly be a short while until a nurse or orderly comes to insert another\nneedle or run some other humiliating and invasive task.\n\nAnd so one simply watches the seconds tick away, as in some odd form of\nChinese water torture. Sometimes the pain is made more vivid by the\ncombination of very real physical discomfort, which incapacity makes\ndifficult to alleviate. Itchiness, dirtiness, and restlessness are the\norders of the day, with powerlessness coming in to make sure the others\ndon\u2019t escape.\n\nOstensibly this place is meant to cure things, the unimpeachable\nknowledge of science and the clean sterility of the building meant to\ncombine to induce health. But, as before in history, the cure may be\nworse than the disease. [Robert Karen has\ndocumented](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitalbabies) how early\nconcerns about antisepsis led hospitals to keep children far away from\ntheir parents. The result, as was plain to anyone paying attention, was\nsevere psychological trauma for the children, who assumed their parents\nhad abandoned them, leading to mental problems that last a lifetime.\n\nWhile modern hospitals induce problems apparently less severe, they are\nstill problems. Again, the doctors that are supposed to help the\npatients seem less concerned about the patients as people than bodies,\nthings to be measured and operated upon, puzzles to solve, problems to\nfix. They do not tell the patient what is being done to them, do not\nreap the benefits that could be received by engaging them in the search\nfor the solution, but instead only share knowledge when forced by law\nand precedent, preferring to keep the real details private among the\npriesthood of doctors and nurses.\n\n[Barbara Ehrenreich and Deidre English\nnote](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400078008) how well-off women of the\npre-feminist era suffered from mysterious symptoms of inactivity, a\ncondition they diagnose as the psychological result of their inactivity\nand powerlessness; society entrusted them with no responsibility and so\ntheir minds collapsed from lack of active use.\n\nWhile women have made great strides in the years since, for many the\nproblem is still quite real. And laid up in a hospital, with domestic\nand childrearing tasks undoable, they may find the responsibilities they\nhad fade away, their condition stripped back to that of their afflicted\nforebearers.\n\nAnd so patriarchical society and patriarchical medicine combine to strip\nall vestiges of humanity away. No freedom, no responsibility; no\nmovements, no tasks; no privacy, no thought. The person becomes the body\nthat the doctors treat them as.\n\nFriends and family may try to visit, in an attempt to bring a bit of\ntheir outside world into this sterile place, but the awkward situation\nstrains even the best relationships. Friendly conversations become hard\nwhen one party is lying in bed moaning, while strained family\nrelationships are stretched further, surfacing their most disgustingly\ndysfunctional aspects. Family members, whatever else they may\naccomplish, somehow learn the remarkable skill of knowing just what to\ndo to drive you up the wall. And as the hospital environment (along with\nthe psychological stress of seeing you trapped in it) drives them insane\nas well, their presence quickly becomes more curse than blessing.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen an environment so effective at inducing such severe\npsychological pain. After just an hour, I feel like screaming, tearing,\npounding, killing. I go \u201cout of my mind\u201d and yearn to get out of my body\nas well, running around in circles, pounding against the floor, with not\neven exhaustion appearing to cure me.\n\nIt needn\u2019t be this way, for there is a cure: the joy of life. Sanity can\nbe restored through attempts at music, channeling the fundamental\ndisorder into form and elegance, focusing the energy toward good. Art,\nespecially the art of nature, as Alexander suggested, is likely another\ncure. But hospitals aren\u2019t built for that.\n\n*Bonus:* [Life in the Hospital](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitallife)\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195019199", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400078008"], "time": 1159340400.0, "postid": "femhosp", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitalbabies", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitallife"]}, "books2009": {"post_title": "2009 Review of Books", "tags": [], "post_content": "2009 Review of Books\n====================\n\nJanuary 3, 2010\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWell, it\u2019s time for my annual look back thru the books I read this year.\n(Previously: [2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006),\n[2007](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007),\n[2008](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books).)

[Gaming the Vote](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002SB8OMA)\n\n    Poundstone\u2019s really become an amazing writer. While this isn\u2019t as\n    good as *[Fortune\u2019s\n    Formula](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990)* it really is quite\n    fun. Poundstone takes a rather novel tack in making the argument for\n    voting system reform. Instead of saying that it will allow for\n    third-parties to get a fair hearing, he argues it will protect the\n    major parties from the insidious effect of spoilers.\n\n    Furthermore, instead of IRV, Approval, or even Condorcet voting, he\n    endorses Range Voting as the best voting system, arguing against\n    Condorcet on some weird grounds about determinant ballots that just\n    doesn\u2019t make sense to me (p. 226).\n\n    Both of these seem reasonable when Poundstone lays them out, but are\n    totally insane upon further inspection. Voting reform may protect\n    against spoilers in the short-term, but in the long term it\u2019ll\n    likely doom us to some kind of fractured multiparty system. (That\u2019s\n    not to say it\u2019s a bad thing.) And range voting, like its proponents,\n    is totally batshit insane. (He even passes on their ridiculous\n    claims about it being better than democracy with a straight face.)\n\n    Let\u2019s think about this for a second. Strategic voting with a range\n    ballot (which even range voting\u2019s proponents say they\u2019ll do) is\n    simply approval voting (plus maybe some meaningless nursery effect \u2014\n    if you want that, just have a nonbinding approval box or something).\n    So for the system to work, it depends on people voting\n    astrategically. But obviously those people\u2019s votes will count less\n    than strategic votes. So range voting\u2019s only advantage over approval\n    voting is that it counts the votes of naive voters less. How is that\n    fair?\n\n    I think the Range Voting comparison with Condorcet is rigged; you\u2019ll\n    notice they never provide any explanation for why their supposedly\n    strategic Condorcet behavior is actually strategic. And the only\n    strategic Condorcet behavior Poundstone provides is trying to create\n    a tie to force it into sequential dropping, which seems wildly\n    implausible in a real-life scenario. So it still seems Condorcet\n    outperforms them all.\n\n132. [If You\u2019re an Egalitarian, How Come You\u2019re So\n    Rich?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674006933)\n\n    I really enjoyed this book. It starts with a simple thought\n    experiment: imagine you had a long-lost identical twin who grew up\n    in a conservative home and became a conservative. You, by contrast,\n    grew up in a liberal home and became a liberal. Wouldn\u2019t meeting him\n    make you question your beliefs? And thus, shouldn\u2019t the possibility\n    that you *could* meet him make you question your beliefs? (I\u2019m not\n    totally convinced by this; my beliefs are much more shaken by\n    converts \u2014 people who were strong believers in X but converted to\n    believing in Y.)\n\n    From this, Cohen heads to a reminiscence of his own upbringing,\n    which I found especially touching, perhaps because he has the\n    identity I wish I had: a Canadian communist in an antireligious\n    Yiddish-speaking home. In the middle there\u2019s a good bit on Hegel,\n    Marx, and why not to heighten the contradictions, and he concludes\n    by refuting Rawls with the same argument Matt Yglesias used on Kent\n    Conrad: Rawls says that in a just society, everyone would embrace\n    the Difference Principle, but the Difference Principle allows for\n    differences because some people will work harder if they get more,\n    but if those people embrace the principle then why wouldn\u2019t they\n    give their money to the poor and embrace egalitarianism? He ends by\n    addressing the title question and accepting a sort of Yglesian\n    approach to politics: an overriding concern with the structure of\n    political institutions, but also a strong sense of moral demands for\n    people to achieve they best they can within existing structures.\n\n    Finally, it got me wondering: a lot of Marx (and, I would add,\n    Keynes) thinks about the future as some sort of society where\n    industrial products give us abundance and economic laws loosen their\n    hold on us. The industrial revolution didn\u2019t do that, but perhaps\n    the post-scarcity technological future might?\n\nAnd my first book of the new year is Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s\n*[Secrets](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142003425)*, which I\u2019m already\nloving.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKO3K5WR85YB/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WP6BGGG59R3/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I4OZJU4C5UQ/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLP4VN68PP0A/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RD66PCB1QYMH2/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9UW6NKMWA6J/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TF84EZX5F0W/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWTNES8RE9XJ/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9RZ7Q6X6BRS/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOVNQ3JLY6GF/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R3312XB4IFMO2R/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QYA1TV8GOIJ/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R370YSX27EUSZS/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW8N49XT2TYR/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBH5SLNQ9JZQ/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1CTSTZLCNO5/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHIL6NUKLFWE/", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R203162R8QOQ3D/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/052144585X", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R171OSWU5ATSOH/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/097063241X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674018214", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679729453", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672409", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871545845", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1566630193", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0143116169", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394758110", "http://www.reasonandpersuasion.com/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002VPE6ZC", "http://www.amazon.com/review/R20404QWHD9MI7/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932416870", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0749304650", "http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/nemch1.htm", "http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/Nemesis%20Chapters/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002SB8OMA", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674006933", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142003425"], "time": 1262505600.0, "postid": "books2009", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/generaltheory"]}, "morewikipedias": {"post_title": "Making More Wikipedias", "tags": [], "post_content": "Making More Wikipedias\n======================\n\nSeptember 14, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias)\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Wikimedia 2006 Elections**\n\nPart 1: [Wikimedia at the\nCrossroads](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads)\\\n Part 2: [Who Writes\nWikipedia?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)\\\n Part 3: [Who Runs\nWikipedia?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia)\\\n Part 4: [Making More\nWikipedians](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians)\\\n Part 5: **Making More Wikipedias**\\\n Part 6: [Code, and Other\nLaws](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw)\\\n\nIf you translate this essay, please [contact me](mailto:me@aaronsw.com).\n\n**[Vote for me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election)** in\nthe election for the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but it seems like everywhere you look people are\ntrying to get a piece of Wikipedia. Wikis sites have been started in\nevery field from [the Muppets](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Wiki)\nto [the law](http://lii.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Main_Page). The\ndomain Wiki.com recently was [sold for 3 million\ndollars](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,71591-0.html?tw=wn_technology_1).\nProfessor Cass Sunstein, [previously\nseen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691095892) arguing the Internet could\ntear apart the republic, just published [a new\nbook](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195189280) arguing tools like wikis\nwill lead us to \u201cInfotopia\u201d. So is it possible to replicate Wikipedia\u2019s\nsuccess? What\u2019s the key that made it work?\n\nUnfortunately, this question hasn\u2019t gotten the attention it deserves.\nFor the most part, people have simply assumed that Wikipedia is as\nsimple as the name suggests: install some wiki software, say that it\u2019s\nfor writing an encyclopedia, and *voila!* \u2014 problem solved. But as\npretty much everyone who has tried has discovered, it isn\u2019t as simple as\nthat.\n\nTechnology industry people tend to reduce web sites down to their\ntechnology: [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/) is simply an instance of\nwiki software, [DailyKos](http://www.dailykos.com/) just blog software,\nand [Reddit](http://reddit.com/) just voting software. But these sites\naren\u2019t just installations of software, there also communities of people.\n\nBuilding a community is pretty tough; it requires just the right\ncombination of technology and rules and people. And while it\u2019s been\nclear that communities are at the core of many of the most interesting\nthings on the Internet, we\u2019re still at the very early stages of\nunderstanding what it is that makes them work.\n\nBut Wikipedia isn\u2019t even a typical community. Usually Internet\ncommunities are groups of people who come together to discuss something,\nlike cryptography or the writing of a technical specification. Perhaps\nthey meet in an IRC channel, a web forum, a newsgroup, or on a mailing\nlist, but the focus is always something \u201cout there\u201d, something outside\nthe discussion itself.\n\nBut with Wikipedia, the goal is building Wikipedia. It\u2019s not a community\nset up to make some other thing, it\u2019s a community set up to make itself.\nAnd since Wikipedia was one of the first sites to do it, we know hardly\nanything about building communities like that.\n\nIndeed, we know hardly anything about building software for that. Wiki\nsoftware has been around for years \u2014 the first wiki was launched in\n1995; Wikipedia wasn\u2019t started until 2001 \u2014 but it was always used like\nany other community, for discussing something else. It wasn\u2019t generally\nused for building wikis in themselves; indeed, it wasn\u2019t very good at\ndoing that.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s real innovation was much more than simply starting a\ncommunity to build an encyclopedia or using wiki software to do it.\nWikipedia\u2019s real innovation was the idea of radical collaboration.\nInstead of having a small group of people work together, it invited the\nentire world to take part. Instead of assigning tasks, it let anyone\nwork on whatever they wanted, whenever they felt like it. Instead of\nhaving someone be in charge, it let people sort things out for\nthemselves. And yet it did all this towards creating a very specific\nproduct.\n\nEven now, it\u2019s hard to think of anything else quite like it. Books have\nbeen co-authored, but usually only by two people. Large groups have\nwritten encyclopedias, but usually only by being assigned tasks.\nSoftware has been written by communities, but typically someone is in\ncharge.\n\nBut if we take this definition, rather than wiki software, as the core\nof Wikipedia, then we see that other types of software are also forms of\nradical collaboration. Reddit, for example, is radical collaboration to\nbuild a news site: anyone can add or edit, nobody is in charge, and yet\nan interesting news site results. Freed from the notion that Wikipedia\nis simply about wiki software, one can even imagine new kinds of sites.\nWhat about a \u201cdebate wiki\u201d, where people argue about a question, but the\noutcome is a carefully-constructed discussion for others to read later,\nrather than a morass of bickering messages.\n\nIf we take radical collaboration as our core, then it becomes clear that\nextending Wikipedia\u2019s success doesn\u2019t simply mean installing more copies\nof wiki software for different tasks. It means figuring out the key\nprinciples that make radical collaboration work. What kinds of projects\nis it good for? How do you get them started? How do you keep them\ngrowing? What rules do you put in place? What software do you use?\n\nThese questions can\u2019t be answered from the armchair, of course. They\nrequire experimentation and study. And that, in turn, requires building\na community around strong collaboration itself. It doesn\u2019t help us much\nif each person goes off and tries to start a wiki on their own. To learn\nwhat works and what doesn\u2019t, we need to share our experiences and be\nwilling to test new things \u2014 new goals, new social structures, new\nsoftware.\n", "external_links": ["mailto:me@aaronsw.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/Election", "http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Wiki", "http://lii.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Main_Page", "http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,71591-0.html?tw=wn_technology_1", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691095892", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195189280", "http://wikipedia.org/", "http://www.dailykos.com/", "http://reddit.com/"], "time": 1158217200.0, "postid": "morewikipedias", "internal_links": ["http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians", "http://aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw"]}, "cambridge": {"post_title": "Cambridge", "tags": [], "post_content": "Cambridge\n=========\n\nFebruary 1, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/cambridge)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere\u2019s something magical about Harvard Square. I\u2019ve hardly been all\nover the world, but I\u2019ve been a bunch of places, and nothing can quite\ncompare to the electricity I feel every time I visit this spot in the\ncenter of Cambridge.\n\nOne one side, the gates of Harvard University. On another, the campus\nbook store. On the third, a pit where kids hang out and bands sometimes\nperform and street performers crowd around. On the fourth, a shopping\ndistrict.\n\nCut down Dunster and you find yourself facing the Harvard Lampoon\nbuilding. Follow the road a bit and you\u2019ll see the mix of shops and\nHarvard dorms. Keep going and you\u2019ll find the riverside. If it\u2019s a fall\nday, the trees will be turning brown and the sky and river will be blow\nand a couple boats will be rowing down the stream and you\u2019ll breathe in\nthe air and wonder if there could ever be any paradise more perfect.\n\nAcross the river is the tree-lined campus of the Harvard Business\nSchool, but turn back up JFK Street and you\u2019ll see hotels and shops and\ncafes and parks and boulevards. Everything you\u2019ll ever need is there and\ncars and people intermingle, looking content.\n\nMake a left on Brattle and follow it a ways and you\u2019ll see a little dip\nin the street. Another singer has set up shop there and kids are sitting\non the stone slab in front, listening to the songs, lying on their\nbacks, reading books.\n\nStop into the Coop or the Harvard Bookstore and you can pick up a book\nof your own. Or cross the street into the famed Harvard Yard, the\ntree-lined quad where college students sit and run and walk. The paths\nmeander past the dorms and classrooms, open up in parks with cafe tables\nwhere vendors sell sandwiches, close up again to head towards the\nlibrary.\n\nThe library, the big building right in the middle, a giant edifice in\npraise of collected knowledge, its big stone steps streaming down as if\nto say *you too may be elevated*. Inside, the soaring archways, the\ncountry\u2019s largest library (after the Library of Congress), the floors\nand floors of stacks, the underground additions, books seeping into the\ngroundwater of the campus.\n\nThe knowledge infects everything. Kids in the street talk about the\narrangement of bones, the politics of the economy, the topology of\nmathematical spaces. Even the service staff get into the act: as you sit\nin a cafe, the college dropout clerk argues with the immigrant cook\nabout the political necessity of marriage and the status of its legality\nin various countries.\n\nThe seasons come here, just as you imagined: the sweltering heat of\nsummer, the overpowering beauty of fall, the snow-capped vistas of\nwinter, the budding excitement of spring. There is a city, an ocean, a\nriver, a suburb, a harbor, and a bike path. There is a subway, but it\u2019s\nnot strictly necessary. The city is small enough that it can be walked\nacross, simple enough that it can all fit in your head.

Pynchon\u2019s novels, as eminent\nliterist Scott McLemee put it, discuss \u201cthe domains of information\ntheory, mathematical physics, cosmology\u201d with frequent references to\nsuch subjects as \u201cWilliam Hamilton\u2019s quaternions or Georg Riemann\u2019s zeta\nfunction\u201d in which the Michelson-Morley experiment takes center stage.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything but a new Richard Feynman book could do\nmore to warm a scientist\u2019s heart.\n\nMeanwhile, take Jonathan Franzen\u2019s bestseller, *The Corrections* (even\nan Oprah\u2019s book club pick!). The book, which revolves around the dot-com\neconomic upturn, not only features frequent and detailed references to\neigenvector-based computer algorithms, advances in neurological\ntechnology, and odd properties of electrophoresis, but even features a\nmain character who goes from being in that most constructivist of\nprofessions \u2014 left-wing literary criticism \u2014 to a job building dot-com\nwebsites.\n\nIt seems geekiness has gone mainstream. And along with it, the geeky\nculture of scientism now buts up against the aesthete culture of\nliterism. It\u2019s hard to see how anyone can take the two cultures\ncomplaints seriously anymore.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1167206400.0, "postid": "twocultures", "internal_links": []}, "books2007": {"post_title": "2007 Review of Books", "tags": [], "post_content": "2007 Review of Books\n====================\n\nJanuary 5, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Previously:* [2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)\n\nThis year I only read 70 books, down from over 120 last year. I guess\nthat\u2019s not too bad considering this was the Year of Other People \u2014 I\nstill beat my general goal of 52. Once again, here are the books that\nstruck me as completely worth reading. This year, though, I\u2019ve\nintermixed them with the other books I read:\n\n-   Fight Club, Palahniuk\n-   The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager\n-   The Crying of Lot 49\n-   Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track, Feynman\n\nGeorge Orwell, *[Down and Out in Paris and London](http://www.orwell.ru/library/novels/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/english/)* \n:   The original *Nickeled and Dimed*, Orwell lives as a plonguer and a\n    tramp in Paris and London respectively. The descriptions of such\n    poor conditions are typically riveting and a great deal of\n    fascinating reflection is included throughout.\n\n-   When Prophecy Fails, Festinger et al\n-   Classical Experiments in Psychology, Mook\n-   Rhetorical Occasions, Berube ([reviewed\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rhetocc))\n-   Incompleteness, Goldstein ([reviewed\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/godel))\n-   Our Underachieving Colleges, Bok ([reviewed\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/underbok))\n-   Way Out There In The Blue, FitzGerald ([reviewed\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intheblue))\n-   No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart, Slee ([reviewed\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nobodyshops))\n-   The Mystery of Consciousness, Searle ([commented on\n    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/searle))\n-   Play It As it Lays, Didion\n-   The Blind Side, Lewis\n\nHugh Laurie, *[The Gun Seller](http://books.theinfo.org/go/067102082X)* \n:   Hugh Laurie, the British actor (Americans know him as Gregory House,\n    M.D.), takes his first crack at writing in this comic novel. (The\n    novel was originally sent to publishers under a pseudonym to avoid\n    celebrity favoritism, but naturally sales forced him to publish it\n    under his real name.) The plot is a fairly standard spy-guns\n    thriller, although very well executed, but the book\u2019s brilliance is\n    the way it adeptly undermines its own cliched language, to hilarious\n    effect. In that way it\u2019s a lot like the British TV comedy *People\n    Like Us* (itself well worth seeing). A good, fun read.\n\n-   Founders at Work, Livingston\n\nJohn Searle, *[Mind, Language, and Society](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465045219)* \n:   This book combines, in abbreviated form, the arguments in all of\n    Searle\u2019s work up to the time of its publication (which is basically\n    everything except *Rationality in Action*). In doing so, it\n    basically has all the hallmarks of Searle\u2019s work, only more so: a\n    clear exposition of complex philosophical ideas that demonstrates\n    how to think better, useful tools to help you understand your world\n    better, and genuine philosophical solutions that let you resolve\n    confusions you may have had before. And all of it is done with\n    Searle\u2019s customary wit and style \u2014 almost an anti-style, like that\n    of D. J. Bernstein, in which he simply explains things clearly and\n    concisely. A model of public philosophy.\n\n-   Freedom and Neurobiology, Searle\n-   The Rediscovery of the Mind, Searle\n-   Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Lindsay\n-   Mind, Searle\n-   Applied Ethics, Singer (ed.)\n-   The Plato Cult, Stove\n-   Responsibility and Control, Fischer and Ravizza\n-   The Game, Neil Strauss ([previously\n    reviewed](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thegame))\n-   My Way, Fischer\n-   The Social Misconstruction of Reality, Hamilton\n-   Adam\u2019s Fallacy\n-   Intentionality, Searle\n-   Writing in America\n-   Intuition\n-   Who Rules America?\n-   Knowledge and Wonder\n-   Things You Should Know About Captain Rick\n-   Send In The Idiots\n-   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson\n-   The Occupation\n\nDavid Lodge, *[Small World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140072659)* \n:   A strong, fun novel, packed with interesting ideas and characters\n    and gimmicks, telling the story of people I love to read about:\n    jetsetting academics. I\u2019m normally not one for novels, but I have to\n    admit it: Lodge makes it work. My only caveat is that this is part\n    of a trilogy and one should probably read the first book, *Changing\n    Places*, first, since later books refer back.\n\n-   Searle, The Construction of Social Reality\n-   Dawkins, The Selfish Gene\n-   Hacking, The Social Construction of What?\n-   Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype\n-   Kitchner, Vaulting Ambition\n-   Goodman, Growing Up Absurd\n-   Gitlin, Inside Prime Time\n-   Layard, Happiness\n-   Thompson, Calculus Made Easy\n-   July, No One Belongs Here More Than You\n-   Searle, Rationality in Action\n-   Virginia Tufte, Syntax as Style\n-   Everything is Miscellaneous\n-   The United States Since 1980\n-   She\u2019s Such a Geek\n-   What We Wish We\u2019d Known\n-   Winnie-the-Pooh\n-   How Doctors Think\n-   Gawande, Better\n-   Bukowski, Post Office\n\nAdrian Tomine, *Shortcomings* \n:   Short, meaningful, and elegant. More than you could reasonably\n    expect from such a book.\n\n-   Conspiracy Theories: The Philosophical Debate\n-   The New Ruthless Economy\n-   Luria, Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations\n-   Wall Street Noir\n-   Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures\n\nSaul Alinsky, *[Rules for Radicals](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679721134)* \n:   Including this is not quite right, because I cannot actually\n    recommend this book without reservation. Alinsky is an anecdotalist,\n    not a writer, and the first half of the book drags as he forces\n    himself to come up with some general platitudes and lecture the\n    youth of today. The second half, however, is incredibly fun and\n    gives you an excitement and energy about accomplishing things with\n    power politics that you just can\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\n:   Sadly, there aren\u2019t any good alternatives I can recommend. Alinsky\u2019s\n    biography, *Let Them Call Me Rebel* by Sanford Horwitt, is quite\n    good but has a few serious failings. First, it drags a great deal in\n    the middle between the beginning of Alinsky\u2019s career, in which he\n    worked for Al Capone as research for his University of Chicago\n    sociology dissertation, and the end, when he organized the black\n    neighborhoods of Chicago and Rochester to fight the white\n    establishment. During these middle years, Alinsky didn\u2019t do much\n    except watch three wives get sick and die and the book spends\n    several hundred pages watching it happen. (Also, frustratingly, the\n    book seems to be exhausted by the time it gets to the interesting\n    end part and covers it in less detail than one would like.)\n    Furthermore, the biographer apparently has come to severely\n    disapprove of his subject, especially his habit of exaggerating or\n    inventing stories about himself, that his disapproving tone takes\n    all the fun out of the action.\n\n:   Another possible alternative is Michael Gecan\u2019s *Going Public*.\n    Gecan is one of the top people in the Industrial Areas Foundation,\n    the foundation Alinsky started and ran for most his life. *Going\n    Public* is his attempt to go back to writing (apparently his college\n    career) and tell the stories of the battles he fought as an IAF\n    organizer. Gecan has much more of a flair for writing than Alinsky,\n    but never got the chance to develop his editing skill, and the\n    result is an uneven, sometimes overwritten, book. Also, Gecan\u2019s IAF\n    is much more watered down than Alinsky\u2019s ever was and some of his\n    tactics just seem downright silly.\n\n:   There\u2019s also Alinsky\u2019s first book, *Reveille for Radicals*, but this\n    can be dismissed as coming out during the early part of career,\n    before some of the most fun stuff. So, because of the extreme\n    importance it had on this year and because I have no serious\n    alternatives, I have to recommend *Rules for Radicals*, along with\n    everyone else.\n\n-   Culture War?\n\nBrian Morton, *[Starting Out in the Evening](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0156033410)* \n:   I read this entire novel in one sitting and it touched me in a\n    profound way. It asks what it means to dedicate your life to\n    writing, by looking at four people who come together, each of which\n    has taken a different position in the New York intellectual scene.\n    It\u2019s also recently out at a film, which is a very bizarre experience\n    to watch, because the book takes place almost entirely in the\n    characters\u2019 heads while the film will have none of that and only\n    shows the brute actions. I\u2019m not sure other people will have the\n    same experience I did, but as a writer I found this book very\n    powerful. By the same token, I\u2019m looking forward to this year\u2019s\n    *[All the Sad Young Literary\n    Men](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670018554)* (and gleefully downing\n    the new issue of *[n+1](http://nplusonemag.com/)*).\n\n-   Richistan\n-   Let Them Call Me Rebel\n-   Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction\n\n", "external_links": ["http://www.orwell.ru/library/novels/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/english/", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/067102082X", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465045219", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140072659", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679721134", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0156033410", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670018554", "http://nplusonemag.com/"], "time": 1199520000.0, "postid": "books2007", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rhetocc", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/godel", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/underbok", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intheblue", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nobodyshops", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/searle", "http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thegame"]}, "books2006": {"post_title": "Books I Recommend Without Reservation: 2006", "tags": [], "post_content": "Books I Recommend Without Reservation: 2006\n===========================================\n\nJune 28, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI read over a hundred and twenty books in 2006. Some of them were OK.\nSome were good. Some were very good. Here are the handful that I can\nrecommend you read without any reservations. This isn\u2019t a top ten list;\nthe books aren\u2019t in any particularly meaningful order. These are just\nthe books that I can honestly say that, as a human being, I think you\nwill enjoy reading (and you\u2019ll be a better person for having done so).\n\nAnnette Lareau, *[Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0520239504)* \n:   This loving ethnography is like a trip inside the lives of children.\n    Laureau spends time with families black and white; poor,\n    middle-class, and wealthy. The description is engrossing and the\n    theoretical contributions thought-provoking, even if you have no\n    background in the field.\nG. H. Hardy *[A Mathematician\u2019s Apology](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521427061)* ([PDF](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician%27s%20Apology.pdf))\n:   Godfrey Hardy was a great mathematician. But, looking back on his\n    life, he wondered what it was he had actually contributed to\n    society. In this, his classic defense of his pragmatically-worthless\n    profession, he examines what it means to have spent your life\n    wisely. (Previous thoughts: [my\n    apology](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology),\n    [Legacy](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/legacy).)\nRaymond Smullyan, *[5000 BC (And Other Philosophical Fantasies)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312295162)* \n:   In this bizarrely delightful little book, Smullyan, the famed\n    recreational logician, addresses topics from the annoyances on long\n    car rides to the most difficult problems in philosophy, often at\n    once, using stories that are so delightfully amusing that it seems\n    hard to believe they could have any educational value.\nAtul Gawande, *[Complications: A Surgeon\u2019s Notes on an Imperfect Science](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312421702)* \n:   Since I read this book, Gawande has become something of a rock star,\n    but here he is the mild-mannered surgeon who\u2019s writing on *Slate*\n    got him picked up by the *New Yorker*. The columns in this book are\n    collected from his pieces for that magazine and address with\n    reflection and investigation the various difficulties of modern\n    medicine.\nGeorge Saunders, *[In Persuasion Nation: Stories](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159448242X)* \n:   I have to be honest with you. I\u2019m not really one for science\n    fiction. Indeed, I\u2019m not a big fan of fiction in general. But George\n    Saunders is different: I\u2019ll read just about anything by him.\n    Saunders\u2019 stories manage to combine a whimsically-imagined future,\n    biting critique of our present era, along with a use of language so\n    delightfully varied that one wonders how one man can have such\n    control over his authorial voice.\nThomas Geoghegan, *[Which Side Are You On?: Trying to Be for Labor When It\u2019s Flat on Its Back](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565848861)* \n:   One would think a book on labor history would be dreadfully dull\n    and, more to the point, depressing. And yet, in the first chapter of\n    this book, I found something that made me laugh or smile widely on\n    practically every page. My friend Rick Perlstein got me to read this\n    book by [telling\n    me](http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9730) it was \u201cthe\n    best political book of the last 15 years [\u2014] the best book of the\n    last 15 years.\u201d (He\u2019s since taken me to meet Geoghegan several\n    times.) It\u2019s hard to imagine a book more important and touching.\nRobert Karen, *[Becoming Attached: Unfolding the Mystery of the Infant-Mother Bond and Its Impact on Later Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)* \n:   At the beginning of the last century, doctors thought parental love\n    was unimportant: [parents weren\u2019t allowed to even visit their kids\n    in the hospital](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitalbabies),\n    psychology experts encouraged moms not to hug or kiss their\n    children, the US government handed out pamphlets on how to be firm\n    with your children. This *tour de force* book tells the amazing\n    story of how all that was overturned by a group of dedicated\n    scientists whose research into the subject of parental love brought\n    some of the most stunningly strong results in the entire field of\n    psychology. Thrillingly good story, textbook on the science, and\n    self-help guide all in one \u2014 I can\u2019t recommend this book enough.\nDavid Feige, *[Indefensible: One Lawyer\u2019s Journey into the Inferno of American Justice](http://books.theinfo.org/go/031615623X)* \n:   Being a public defender is a fairly interesting job, but David Feige\n    manages to make it downright fascinating in this in-depth\n    description of his career. Feige describes his life in luscious\n    detail, from the urine on his doorstep to the gritty details of the\n    courtroom, and doesn\u2019t hesitate to name names or dig into unpleasant\n    subjects. If only there was a book this good on every career.\nScott McCloud, *[Making Comics: Storytelling Secrets of Comics, Manga and Graphic Novels](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060780940)* \n:   Any Scott McCloud book is a treasure, but this one is especially\n    probing. Essentially, McCloud asks what it is a writer does and what\n    it takes to be a good one. His medium is comics, but a lot of the\n    rules are applicable to other formats and it\u2019s hard to imagine a\n    book this curious or this well-written about them.\nDean Baker, *[The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1411693957)* ([full text](http://conservativenannystate.com/))\n:   One wouldn\u2019t expect a book about economic abuses to be fun, but Dean\n    Baker manages to do it, mostly by turning everything you thought you\n    knew about the subject topsy-turvy. I gave this book to a fairly\n    conservative friend of mine and even he loved it. Plus it\u2019s\n    downloadable for free. ([Previous\n    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/cns)) (Disclosure: I liked\n    the book so much I converted it to HTML and got a free paperback\n    copy in return.)\nJeremy Iversen, *[High School Confidential: Secrets of an Undercover Student](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743283635)* ([alt. link](http://isbn.nu/0743283635))\n:   Leaving school, Jeremy Iversen didn\u2019t find the world as exciting as\n    he expected. So he went back. Posing as a high school student, with\n    only the school\u2019s principal knowing the truth, he spent half a year\n    among the kids and teachers, documenting the life of the average\n    Californian and wondering what it meant for our nation\u2019s future. The\n    result is an amazingly good read and a fascinating look at an\n    incredibly important institution. ([Previous\n    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/undercoverlearning))\n    (Disclosure: I\u2019ve [hung\n    out](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visitingla) with the author.)\nLaura Kipnis, *[Against Love: A Polemic](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375719326)* \n:   Kipnis is a rollickingly vicious writer, with sentences that have\n    the rhythm and punch of a machine gun. But the book isn\u2019t just a fun\n    rant, it also makes an incredibly thought-provoking argument about\n    what it means socially to be in a relationship. ([Previous\n    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/againstlove))\nMatt Taibbi and Mark Ames, *[The eXile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0802136524)* \n:   Matt Taibbi is my favorite political journalist. He writes with a\n    raw honesty that manages to be both politically biting and\n    hilarious. This book tells the story of how, after playing\n    professional basketball in Inner Mongolia, met up with co-founder\n    Mark Ames and started an independent newspaper that danced in the\n    flames of Russia\u2019s dying society. The result is a strange and\n    incredible book: stories of seedy dive bars full of drugged up loose\n    women, intermixed with incredible feats of investigative journalism\n    into the oligarchs dragging Russia down \u2014 without any change in\n    tone. It\u2019s wonderful.\nJoan Didion, *[Political Fictions](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375718907)* \n:   Damn, this book is good. Nobody knows how to take a book and skewer\n    it like Didion. The *New York Review of Books* pieces reprinted in\n    here are simply some of the best eviscerations of any genre. Its\n    hard to imagine how people can walk after a review like that.\nJonathan Franzen, *[The Corrections: A Novel](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312421273)* \n:   After the popular reviews and the Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection, I had\n    just about learned to ignore Franzen\u2019s big novel. But when a friend\n    told me she was loving it, I decided to check it out. That was no\n    mistake. This is a thoughtful, readable piece of fiction, with big\n    geeky topics and a hearty emotional core.\nRick Perlstein, *Nixonland* \n:   Perlstein\u2019s last book, *Before the Storm*, managed to turn the story\n    the a largely-dismissed political figure, Barry Goldwater, into a\n    lesson on how the left can take over the country. Now, in\n    *Nixonland*, he examines the turmoil of the 1960s with fresh eyes\n    and the perfidy of the Nixon administration with new depth. I read\n    the book as he was writing it and sent comments \u2014 apparently I was\n    the first outside his home to finish it \u2014 and the final version\n    hasn\u2019t been published.

I\u2019ve mostly tried\nto keep it off this blog, but it\u2019s hard to not get swept up in the\nfever. As someone who wants to make a difference in the world, I\u2019ve long\nwondered whether there was an effective way for a programmer to get\ninvolved in politics, but I\u2019ve never been able to quite figure it out.\n\nWell, recent events and Larry Lessig got me thinking about it again and\nI\u2019ve spent the past few months working with and talking to some amazing\npeople about the problem. I\u2019ve learned a lot and must have gone through\na dozen different project ideas, but I finally think I\u2019ve found\nsomething. It\u2019s not so much a finished solution as a direction, where I\nhope to figure more of it along the way.\n\nSo the site is called watchdog.net and the plan has three parts. First,\npull in data sources from all over \u2014 district demographics, votes,\nlobbying records, campaign finance reports, etc. \u2014 and let people\nexplore them in one elegant, unified interface. I want this to be one of\nthe most powerful, compelling interfaces for exploring a large data set\nout there.\n\nBut just giving people information isn\u2019t enough; unless you give them an\nopportunity to do something about it, it will just make them more\napathetic. So the second part of the site is building tools to let\npeople take action: write or call your representative, send a note to\nlocal papers, post a story about something interesting you\u2019ve found,\ngenerate a scorecard for the next election.\n\nAnd tying these two pieces together will be a collaborative database of\npolitical causes. So on the page about global warming, you\u2019ll be able to\nlearn more about the problem and proposed solutions, research the donors\nand votes on the issue, and see or start a letter-writing campaign.\n\nAll of it, of course, is free software and free data. And it\u2019s all got a\ndozen different APIs to make it easy for others to build on what we\u2019ve\ndone in their own work. The goal is to be a hub, connecting citizens,\nactivists, organizations, politicians, programmers, and everybody else\nwho\u2019s interested in politics.\n\nThe hope is to make it as interesting and easy as possible to pull\npeople into politics. It\u2019s an ambitious goal with many pieces and\npossibilities, but with all the excitement right now we want to get\nsomething up as fast as possible. So we\u2019ll be developing live on\nwatchdog.net, releasing pieces as soon as we finish them. Our first goal\nis to put up data about every representative and a way to write them.\n\nI\u2019ve managed to find an amazing group of people willing to help out with\nbuilding it so far. And the [Sunlight\nNetwork](http://www.sunlightnetwork.com/) has encouraged me and\ngraciously agreed to fund it. But we still need many more hands,\nespecially programmers.

You have to lose weight first.\n\nThat leaves eating less. I have found three strategies to be effective\nhere:\n\n1.  **Get rid of all snacks.** It used to be when I was hungry, I\u2019d just\n    grab a snack from the kitchen. It got so I basically did this\n    without thinking and, as a result, I ended up eating a lot of\n    snacks. Now the only food I have is unprepared; if I want to eat, I\n    have to consider it and take the time to actually cook something or\n    travel to someplace that sells prepared food.\n\n2.  **Drink more water.** There are [lots of\n    reasons](http://www.shapeupshop.com/weightloss/water-weight-loss.html)\n    to drink more water, but it\u2019s also a great way to lose weight. A lot\n    of what feels like hunger is actually thirst, while having water in\n    your stomach seems to counteract certain feelings of hunger.\n    Furthermore, burning fat requires extra water.\n\n3.  **Don\u2019t be afraid to be hungry.** This is no doubt my most\n    controversial tactic, but I do tend to think the body has a \u201cset\n    point\u201d for the number of calories it\u2019s used to consuming. Lowering\n    that set point may mean ignoring a bout of hunger or two and\n    possibly even going a whole day without eating. But after that, your\n    body gets full after eating much less. Again: I\u2019m not saying more\n    than a day \u2014 this isn\u2019t anorexia \u2014 but a one-day fast is far from\n    unheard of.\n\n    This may be easier for me since I almost always eat meals alone,\n    making it no big deal if I skip them. People who eat meals with\n    others may need to get used to only eating a side dish or just\n    nibbling at their order.\n\nLosing weight has been better than I ever imagined. Not only am I\ndramatically thinner, but I have more energy, I waste less time eating,\nand I now like the way I look. I\u2019m much more flexible and mobile and,\nmost incredibly, I\u2019ve gotten taller \u2014 this at the age of 23. (A lot of\npeople are skeptical that I\u2019ve actually grown taller, but the changes\nare measurable and dramatic and come with all the symptoms of height\ngrowth I remember from my childhood (including the strange urge to\nstretch vertically on a regular basis). I suppose it\u2019s possible the\nheight difference simply results from better posture, but that seems\nworth counting.)\n\nI do not propose a new diet or some new theory. These are very simple\ncommonsense tips: remove temptation, get enough water, remove\nobligation. But I\u2019ve found they\u2019ve been enough for me to lose dramatic\namounts of weight.

It\u2019s a grand, elegant\ncampus, the school has a singular reputation, the neighborhood is one of\nthe most interesting in the world. And yet, on the college tour, this\nisn\u2019t what they told us. They mentioned a bit about John Harvard and the\n1700s but spent most of their time telling us how great it was they had\n\u201cshopping week\u201d, where you could try out different courses for a couple\nclasses.\n\nThe other month, I visited the University of Chicago. Chicago has a\nworldwide reputation as a tough-minded school. It seems like every field\nhas a \u201cChicago School\u201d of thought and the University\u2019s former presidents\nare responsible for things like the Great Books. But you wouldn\u2019t know\nthat from the tour \u2014 the only time actually studying was mentioned was\nwhen one kid said he\u2019d heard the University had a nose-to-the-grindstone\nreputation. \u201cWell,\u201d the tour guide said, \u201cyou can work hard if you\nwant,\u201d and then went back to talking about the sports program.\n(\u201cWhenever I feel like exercise,\u201d the University\u2019s president once said,\n\u201cI lie down until the feeling passes.\u201d)\n\nIt was as if the entire admissions program had been through a focus\ngroup, every bit of individuality shorn off. They put their\nself-description through a series of tests and only the generic things\nthat every student finds themselves agreeing with survived the ordeal.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d they now insist, \u201cwe\u2019re just like every university. We want to\nlet you be you.\u201d But why go to a University for that? I can be me at\nhome just fine.\n\nNo, the real reason I want to go to a University \u2014 and the reason, when\nyou get right down to it, everybody else seems to be interested in as\nwell \u2014 is the people. I want to go to a place filled with people like\nme, but smarter; a place where you can\u2019t help but learn.\n\nThe key phrase there is \u201cpeople like me\u201d. What I want to know is what\nthe culture is like. To unfairly overgeneralize, people at Harvard are\nsnobbish, people at Stanford are lazy, and people at MIT are nerds. But\n(with the possible exception of MIT which actually sells \u201cnerd pride\u201d\nclothing) none of these places advertise this fact. After all,\nadvertising your individuality alienates some of the focus group. In\nfact, that\u2019s exactly the point!\n\nAnd yet, somehow, the cultures remain. It\u2019s not clear to me whether the\nuniversity itself has a culture (perhaps passed down by the older\nstudents and professors) and whoever attends simply learns to conform or\nwhether there\u2019s a secret bulletin I\u2019m not getting about which university\neach kind of person should go to. I suspect the former, since I\u2019ve heard\nthat even houses at Harvard, to which students are assigned randomly\nwhen they arrive, manage to develop a culture of their own.\n\nSo how to decide where to go?\n\nThere are some people who say that if you go to a large enough\nuniversity, you\u2019ll be able to find a subculture of people you can get\nalong with. At MIT, for example, a complicated \u201crush\u201d system at the\nbeginning of the school year allows incoming freshman to sample a\nvariety of dorms and then floors within that dorm to find the place they\nbelong. The dorms apparently put on lavish shows to communicate their\nculture to the incoming students and people seem fairly happy with where\nthey end up.\n\nMIT is a bit of a special case, of course, but some insists that similar\nsubcultures exist at every college, you just have to seek them out.\nPerhaps that\u2019s true, but even so, what\u2019s the point of the university\nthen? There\u2019s a subculture of people I can get along with right here; I\nwant to go to school for something a little more concentrated.\n\nColleges need to drop the focus-group-enforced blandness. [As Malcolm\nGladwell would put\nit](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=m_gladwell&flashEnabled=1),\npeople don\u2019t want ten varieties of bland tomato sauce to choose from.\nSome people love mild and some love extra-chunky.

The kind where the thing is absolutely perfect,\nthe film ends and you shout \u201cBravo!\u201d and you\u2019re elated walking out to\nthe car and then have forgotten the thing entirely by the time you get\nhome. And the kind where something\u2019s not quite right and so it sticks\nwith you, gnaws at you, because the notes don\u2019t quite resolve.\n\n*Citizen Kane* is definitely the second kind of movie.\n\nTo be sure, it had its moments of sheer genius. Number one, in my mind,\nis juxtaposing Welles\u2019 performance as the young Kane gracefully dancing\nwith a showgirl at an office party against him as a much older Kane\nstumbling in the effort to trash a room in his Florida mansion. In both\ncases, there\u2019s an absolutely beautiful physicality to the performance\nand the notion that the same actor was capable of doing both at the same\nage is nothing short of stunning.\n\nThe film is widely-hailed for the cinematographic innovation of *deep\nfocus*, using tricks with projections and lenses to keep foreground and\nbackground in focus at the same time. But the effect is even more\ninteresting than the technique: the film is filled with long shots where\ntons of action goes on through staging but the camera never cuts away. A\ncharacter in the foreground talks to a character in the background, they\npace, they swap places, and the camera might pan a bit (but usually not)\nbut it never cuts.\n\nAnd when it does cut, it always cuts in a sort of overlapping way. The\nstandard modern movie shot is the over-over-two-shot: characters A and B\nare talking, facing each other; the screen alternates between a shot of\nA filmed over the shoulder of B and vice versa. You can clearly see the\npeople but you lose all sense of the space that they\u2019re in, since your\nperspective is constantly flipping back and forth.\n\n*Kane* does pretty much the opposite, almost every new shot overlaps in\nsome way with the previous one, so you never lose your place. A shot\nmight go from wide to tight or tight to wide or, in some cases, shift\nslightly to the left or right, but it almost never completely flips\ndirection, and when it does (as when Kane enters the newsroom for the\nfirst time) it flips around a very noticeable piece of the set, so it\u2019s\nextremely obvious what happened.\n\nThis may have been the result of some deep insecurity about confusing an\naudience mostly used to watching plays from fixed seats, but I like it.\nThe result is to give the film a tremendous physicality that makes it\nall feel much more substantial. This sort of thing was apparently\nextremely common in the early days of film, which makes me wonder why\nit\u2019s so rare now. ([The main modern exception is *There Will Be\nBlood*](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2011/02/14/watching-you-watch-there-will-be-blood/),\nwhich was intentionally a period piece.)\n\nBut even among older films *Kane* distinguishes itself: most films have\nclear staging because they\u2019re simply staged as plays, with a static\ncamera watching a flat scene. *Kane*\u2019s sets, innovatively, have ceilings\nand a full complement of walls and while action feels staged in them\nthey never really feel like they\u2019re on a stage.\n\nBut in the scheme of things, it has to be admitted, these are small\nthings. *Kane* suffers from far bigger problems. The first, and most\nblatant, is that aside from Welles the cast simply cannot act. Well,\nthey cannot act in movies, at least. Were this a radio show, they would\nhave been fantastic \u2014 close your eyes and you hear nothing but strong,\nstirring performances. Were they on stage, they likely also would have\ndone just fine. But this was their first role in film and apparently no\none stopped to tell them that in the movies, we can see your face.\n\nTheir faces are consistently either blank, as if they forgot they were\nsupposed to move it to and not just their voice, or overwrought, as if\nthey were exaggerating their features so they would carry through to the\ncheap seats. In either case, watching them destroys any sense of realism\nthat the careful shot construction has built up and brings the whole\nthing to the verge of melodrama.\n\nThe other big problem is the script. The \u201cspiraling\u201d effect of\noverlapping tellings of Kane\u2019s life (a bit like the overlapping cuts, I\nsuppose?) may have been a brilliant formal innovation, but it doesn\u2019t\nreally add much to the film. Instead of following the through-line of a\nstrong and compellng story, we\u2019re constantly bouncing back and forth in\ntime, with interruptions at key moments. What do these interruptions get\nus? As far as I can tell, they just slow the film down.\n\n(The best argument I can make for them is that they emphasize the fact\nthat Kane drove those who were closest to him away. This makes some\nsense for Susan and Jed, but Bernstein is still loyal to him and\nThatcher is dead, so what does that emphasize?)\n\nThe modern excuse for this kind of early flash-forward is to set up a\nbig mystery which only the full story can resolve (*Damages* is an\negregious example). *Kane* kind of does this with the famous \u201cRosebud\u201d\n(although since we see this first-hand, it doesn\u2019t explain why the whole\ninvestigative-obituarist plotline is necessary). Perhaps it was just\nterribly spoiled for me, but Rosebud did not feel like a particularly\ncompelling mystery. Especially with all the questions raised by the\n\u201cNews on the March\u201d sequence, it was really the last of the things I was\ncurious about. (And the notion that an editor would be so curious about\nit as to waste that much money on an answer really belies the\npresentation of journalism in the rest of the film.)\n\n(I\u2019m also upset that the film wasted a great opportunity for the ending.\nIt currently ends with a speech by the investigative obituarist, saying\nthat he never figured out what \u201cRosebud\u201d was but even if he did it was\nprobably just another ill-fitting piece in the man\u2019s great jigsaw\npuzzle. Then the camera pulls out and cuts to a wider shot and cuts\nagain and eventually cuts to a whole new scene where someone pulls a\nsled out of a pile and throws into into a fire and then we cut to the\nsled and see the name \u201cRosebud\u201d as it gets licked with flames. The\nobvious ending is to have the camera pull back in one steady shot as we\nhear the jigsaw puzzle speech until amidst this enormous pile of junk\nthe sled is just in foreground, with \u201cRosebud\u201d written on its side, as\nthe gaggle of journalists wanders off in background. What\u2019s all this\n*deep focus* stuff for if you\u2019re not going to use it for a movie-making\nshot like that!)\n\nThe film does have some great bits about journalism, but it also has\nsome weird lapses. There\u2019s hardly anything of substance about the\nSpanish-American War, which I would have thought was the most\ninteresting tale of Hearst\u2019s life. The film is weirdly afraid to leave\nthe country (it follows Kane to Chicago, but not to Europe) or even the\nbuilding (I guess street scenes would have been too expensive), making\nit feel a bit cooped-up and claustrophobic.\n\nBut the most frustrating thing, script-wise, is that it raises the grand\nquestions of ambition and money and power and answers them with just a\ngiant muddle. Kane was incapable of loving but desperate to be loved,\nwe\u2019re told repeatedly, but what kind of sense does that make? There are\nsome great moments: in an early precursor of \u201cFair and Balanced\u201d, Kane\nprints a brave \u201cStatement of Principles\u201d promising to always tell the\ntruth on his front page, just above a story about a murder he invented.\nBut this is on day one! There is no sense that power corrupts or even,\nas Caro would have it, that power reveals. Kane just stay the same\nthroughout and as his means allow him to grow the size of his gestures,\nhe also grows the size of his failures. Maybe this is an interesting\nphilosophical point (don\u2019t count on scale to save you?) but a story so\nstatic doesn\u2019t work particularly well as drama. Caro would have told it\nas an epic rise and fall. Kane would have told it as an epic rise. But\nWelles just tells it as a flatline. It\u2019s like a Caro subject without the\nCaro, or the subject.\n\nI put this criticism last because it\u2019s the one I\u2019m most uncomfortable\nabout.

It\u2019s similarly obvious\nwhen the camera is on acid: rainbow colors, things melting into each\nother, and a sort of dazed gaze. Yet, despite the prevalence of pot,\nI\u2019ve never seen a film or TV show where the camera is high on marijuana.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to show. Some deep breaths, a\nslight tingling sensation, and then an odd feeling as if something is\npressing on part of your brain, lifting your head up, making you happy.\nAn odd happiness, to be sure, but a happiness nonetheless. Friends are\nunable to distinguish between when I\u2019ve just gone skinnydipping and when\nI\u2019m simply high. It\u2019s hard to show a camera being happy.\n\nContrast this with Omega-3 fatty acids, the fish oil acids that various\nnew studies are supposed to show have all sorts of positive effects for\nyour brain. When I swallowed a stack of Omega-3 pills, I felt as if I\nwas crawling up into my head, living in there instead of plotting the\nnext moves for my body. It made it pretty hard to get anything done.\n\nIn San Francisco, medical marijuana is perfectly legal and health-food\nculture makes Omega-3 practically mandatory, but possessing a gun is\nactually outlawed within city limits (even for off-duty cops). To\nactually discharge one you have to drive south of the border, where\nshooting ranges allow deprived northerners to partake of this\nrecreational craze.\n\nUnlike the flowing, hippie vibe of drug culture, gun culture is strictly\nutilitarian: concrete walls, florescent lights, drab carpeting.\nTough-looking guys take your license and hand you a gun. First-timers go\ninto the training room for a quick primer on how to use it, then you\ntake your weapon, ammo, and target into the shooting range.\n\nMost of the targets are pretty bland \u2014 vague silhouettes or bullseyes \u2014\nbut there was one frightening option that featured a blatantly\nstereotypical illustration of a hooded bad guy character holding a gun\nto a cute young girl\u2019s head. Normally descriptions of such pictures are\nmore evocative than the pictures themselves, but this drawing was just\nabout perfect.\n\nNaturally, this was the target our neighbors on the shooting range had\nchosen and were now shooting at with enormous shotguns whose blasts\nshook the entire room. Meanwhile, I had a small handgun with a little\nbit of a kick and a simple silhouette.\n\nMy gun jammed the first couple of times I tried to shoot; I had to go\nthrough the process of unloading and reloading it several times before I\neven shot a single bullet. It\u2019s amazing how comically fake the actual\ngun feels when you do this \u2014 it makes all the noises and motions you\u2019d\nexpect from a gun, but it seems to lack any internal mechanisms for\ndoing the actual shooting, like a prop for a movie.\n\nWhen I finally did manage to get the gun working, I relaxed, aimed my\nweapon, and took ten shots at where I thought the bullseye was. (My\nlong-distance eyesight is really terrible and I hadn\u2019t thought to bring\nmy glasses until now, so I gave it my best shot.) I shot again and\nagain, the pattern of kicking and aiming becoming almost rhythmic. When\nthe gun was finally empty, I pushed the little button to whirr my target\nback to me. To my amazement, nearly all ten bullets had gone in right by\nthe bullseye. My partner looked frightened.\n\nWhat\u2019s odd about shooting is how, well, relaxing it is. Something about\nthe furious action of the gun seems to drain you of all your nervous\nenergy. And while, if you think about it, the item you\u2019re holding is a\nweapon of terrible destruction, there\u2019s very little visual evidence of\nthat fact. Just as the gun feels like a prop, the whole thing feels like\na game: aim, press the trigger, and some dots appear in a piece of\npaper. But when you\u2019re done you don\u2019t feel hyped-up like after a video\ngame. Instead you feel as if what you actually discharged was your\nnervous energy.\n\nWe rolled up the bullet-ridden silhouette to take home as a souvenir.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll mail this to my mom,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very\ngood idea,\u201d came the reply.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1166515200.0, "postid": "drugsandguns", "internal_links": []}, "rlrr": {"post_title": "Release Late, Release Rarely", "tags": [], "post_content": "Release Late, Release Rarely\n============================\n\nJuly 5, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rlrr)\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen you look at something you\u2019re working on, no matter what it is, you\ncan\u2019t help but see past the actual thing to the ideas that inspired it,\nyour plans for extending it, the emotions you\u2019ve tied to it.

It is therefore inherently \u201celitist,\u201d merely in\n> this obvious sense: as with skateboarding, some will be demonstrably\n> better at it than others.\n\nKragen saw fit to ponder the meaning of elitism. Kragen thinks of\nhimself as an anti-elitist, but he\u2019s also very pro-science. How to\nreconcile the two?\n\nKragen begins by defining \u201celite\u201d:\n\n> An \u201celite\u201d is a small group of people who are distinguished from the\n> majority in one of two ways: either they are better in some way, or\n> they have more power.

Sometimes an elite is distinguished by the mastery of a\n> particular skill, such as skateboarding or mathematics, and sometimes\n> by past accomplishments; but the much more common sense of the term\n> today is to refer to a group of people who have power.\n\nElitism, then (according to Kragen) is the ideology that insists that\nthe elite and non-elite reached their positions through intrinsic merit.\n(This belief might also be called meritocracy, but that is perhaps a\nless pejorative term.)\n\nIronically, the very article that begun this investigation appears to\nbelieve in this ideology. The article claims that textbooks, in trying\nto be \u201cdemocratic\u201d, lower their standards so that even the dullest\nstudents can comprehend them. Instead, the article insists, textbooks\nmust be more \u201celitist\u201d and teach real science, which is hard.\n\nAnti-elitists like Kragen and I would agree that textbooks should teach\nmore real science, which is hard. But we do not consider this elitist,\nbecause we do not believe that only a small elite has the capability of\ncomprehending physics.\n\nTo anti-elitists, egalitarianism does not require lowering standards,\nsince we believe more people can reach higher standards with more\nresources. But to elitists, this seems an impossibility. The only reason\nthey are in the club is because they deserve it; to let others in\nrequires bringing the requirements down.\n", "external_links": ["http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-October/000831.html"], "time": 1162105200.0, "postid": "whatselitist", "internal_links": []}, "pokayoke": {"post_title": "New: The Pokayoke Guide to Developing Software", "tags": [], "post_content": "New: The Pokayoke Guide to Developing Software\n==============================================\n\nJune 26, 2012\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/pokayoke)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI\u2019ve put together a new guide for developing software, from idea to\narchitectural details.

Perhaps, I thought for a while,\nit is because there is a \u201clanguage organ\u201d that has specifically evolved\nto let them learn speech while reading has to be learned with more\ngeneral portions of the brain. But the more I learn about neurology, the\nmore ridiculous that seems.\n\nIn retrospect, the answer is rather obvious. Children learn a language\nbecause they are surrounded by it. It\u2019s unavoidable. Their world is full\nof people speaking it and the pattern matchers in their brains go to\ntown, figuring out the structures underlying its grammar and associated\nits vocabulary with the other things they see around them.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for there to be anything similar with words. Sure, some\nwords appear in fairly regular positions (MEN on bathroom doors,\nperhaps) and children may learn to recognize them, but for the most part\nwords are rather avoidable and their patterns hard to spot. How are\nchildren to draw a connection between the words in the newspaper and any\nsentences that they can understand? The only clues are the pictures and\nanyone who\u2019s read picturebooks to a kid knows that kids make valiant use\nof those few clues, but it\u2019s simply not enough to let them learn to\nread.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a way to give children the additional clues they\nrequire, but at their own pace. An adult can read books but only reads\nlinearly and soon gets bored of reading the same thing over and over\nagain. (I\u2019ve often thought that children were being stupid by reading\nthe same things over and over and over again. Now I realize I\u2019m the\nstupid one; it\u2019s the kids who are being smart. Only through repetition\ncan your brain see the patterns!) It\u2019s very difficult for children to\npick up a pattern under such conditions.\n\nBut devices never get tired, so I would propose a device. Here is what I\nimagine: Give the child an iPad with a special program for reading\nbooks. The program provides a selection of nice picture books with words\nin large type underneath. Switching pages can be done the usual way;\nkids seem pretty good at figuring out gestural interfaces. But the big\ninnovation is simply this: when you touch a word, it turns red while the\nspeakers say it out loud.\n\nIn this way, the child can have the machine read the book to them. Tap\nthe words in sequence and the book pronounces them. If a word is somehow\nunclear, just tap it again. When you finish the page, just go to the\nnext one. When you finish a book, read another, or start over.\n\nSoon, I imagine, the child will make some basic associations. They will\nlearn that tapping the word \u201cthe\u201d makes the sound \u201cthuh\u201d and means\n\u201cthe\u201d. They will no longer need to tap it every time to find this out \u2014\nthey can save time by saying it out loud themselves. Eventually, they\ncan just say it in their heads.\n\nPretty quickly, more and more common words can be handled this way. Then\nthe child begins noticing patterns between common words. All the words\nbeginning with k have a kuh sound! With such patterns recognized, some\nwords can be sounded out. Eventually, only strange words need to be\ntapped \u2014 the rest the child can read by themselves.\n\nPeople who have not spent much time around children might claim such a\ndevice will make children lazy \u2014 why learn to read when a device will do\nit for them? But children are desperate to read; those who cannot will\noften try to memorize the shorter books their parents read to them so\nthey can pretend to read those books themselves. This device would\nsimply give them the tools they need. It would lead their brains to make\nthe same associations that the software makes occur physically: point at\nthis word, hear this sound. And there\u2019s nothing are brains are better at\nthan recognizing such simple patterns and being able to predict them in\nthe future.\n\nPerhaps this software already exists. If so, please tell me. If not, I\u2019d\nlike to work with someone to make it. Will it work? There\u2019s only one way\nto find out, but I think it\u2019s got a pretty good shot.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1269846000.0, "postid": "readingmachine", "internal_links": []}, "margo": {"post_title": "Margo Seltzer", "tags": [], "post_content": "Margo Seltzer\n=============\n\nMarch 24, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/margo)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*[part of Ada Lovelace Day](http://findingada.com/)*\n\nMargo Ilene Seltzer was born in rural, upstate New York. \u201cI like to\ndescribe it as a place with more cows than people,\u201d she later told an\ninterviewer. In her small town, she excelled in math and science, but\nwasn\u2019t sure that this would translate when she began attending Harvard\nfor college in 1979.\n\nGraduating in 1983, she studied Applied Mathematics, with a computer\nscience concentration. She took some time to work in industry before\ngoing to graduate school in Computer Science at Berkeley in 1988. Her\ndissertation, completed in 1992, was on \u201cFile System Performance and\nTransaction Support\u201d and found that, due to the costs of garbage\ncollection in most real-world uses, log-structured filesystems in the\nliterature were not any faster than read-optimized filesystems.\n\nAt the time, Berkeley\u2019s CS department was excitedly developing BSD,\nwriting free replacements for all the Unix utilities. They needed a\nreplacement for ndbm, the prominent Unix database manager, and hsearch,\nits hash search function, and Margo had just finished taking a database\ncourse. She decided to apply her new skills by writing hash for BSD.\nSomeone else wrote btree and they both ended up getting packaged\ntogether as db185, which shipped with BSD 4.4.\n\nBerkeleyDB, as it became known, was used in many places but among them\nwas the University of Michigan LDAP server. Netscape built upon this\nserver for their own directory product but found that since bsddb didn\u2019t\nsupport transactions, multiple concurrent writes could lead to corrupted\ndata. They noticed that Margo had once written a paper on the subject of\nadding transactions and gave her a call. It was 1996.\n\nShe said that it was simply academic work and wasn\u2019t ready for use in\nproduction. They asked if she could get it ready for production. They\ncould pay, they reminded her. It was the first time she\u2019d ever done\nanything like this for pay, but she gathered together some friends and\nfounded a company to make the product for Netscape. They relicensed it\nfrom BSD (which allows anyone to integrate it) to their own GPL-style\nlicense which would allow them to continue to separately charge Netscape\nfor using it. Their company was called Sleepycat, and Margo was its CTO.\n\nThe company was a major success, with BerkeleyDB being used in\neverything from SQL databases to behind-the-scenes at Amazon and Google.\nIn 2006, as Oracle was acquiring all the open source database companies,\nthey acquired Sleepycat and Margo went to work for Oracle.\n\nAt the same time, however, she was pursuing a parallel career in\nacademia. In 1992 she became an Assistant Professor of Computer Science\nat Harvard. She became an Associate Professor in 1997, was named Gordon\nMcKay Professor in 2000 and received tenure, occasioning [a *Crimson*\neditorial](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=100809) on how a\nwoman \u201cbeat all the odds\u201d.

And if she doesn\u2019t, you can just not pay her.\n\nBut if you want to hire an interior designer, it\u2019s a mess. Let\u2019s say you\npick one by looking through their portfolio and concluding that you like\ntheir work. But when they come to design your place, you hate the\nresult. What can you do? You say that what you got looks nothing like\nthe stuff in the portfolio and they\u2019ll just say that every space is\ndifferent and so has a different result. There\u2019s no way to ever prove\nthey did a bad job.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something fairly inconsequential. Imagine you\u2019re [wrongly\ncharged with\nmurder](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann)\nor stricken with a potentially-fatal illness. Picking the right lawyer\nor doctor could make the difference between life and death.\n\nBut now there\u2019s not even a portfolio for you to look at. Sure, you can\nsee if the lawyer\u2019s won a lot of cases or if the doctor\u2019s kept most of\nher patients alive, but that doesn\u2019t tell you much \u2014 it probably just\nmeans they\u2019re either very lucky or mostly choose easy cases.\n\nPerhaps instead of looking at outcomes, you could look at the decisions\nthey made along the way. But even if you could get your hands on those\nrecords, how could you possibly learn enough about law or medicine to\nevaluate them? And even if you somehow tried, there\u2019s probably all sorts\nof relevant specific details about the circumstances that could never\nmake it into even the most detailed histories.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just hard for the delegator \u2014 for the same reason, it\u2019s\nhard for the delegatee. If you want to be great at painting walls white,\nit\u2019s easy to get pretty immediate feedback about whether you did the job\ncorrectly. But if you\u2019re a elementary school teacher, you\u2019ll really just\nnever know. You hope you\u2019re helping your kids succeed in life, but\nthere\u2019s no way for you to check that. And what are the chances that you\nstarted doing everything right just by intuition?\n\nNo, the expert performance movement has shown the only way to get really\ngood at something is to practice, continually comparing what you did\nagainst the results it achieved. But in any sort of delegated job this\nis practically impossible: the uncertainties are too great, the feedback\nloops take too long, the opportunities to practice much too rare.\n\nTraditionally, we solve these problems by having an academic discipline\nfigure out the right thing to do using scale. If doctors were just on\ntheir own, they\u2019d still be no better than witch doctors: people would\ncome in with problems and they\u2019d pick a random herb or spell to try and\npray it made the patient feel better. They\u2019d never really know whether\nthey were helping or hurting. But they\u2019re not on their own: because\nmedical schools can conduct randomized trials with hundreds of people,\nthey can just read the results and learn what actually works.\n\nA lot is still left to individual judgment \u2014 there\u2019s not a medical study\nfor every scenario and even if there was, you\u2019d still have to choose how\nto interpret the results \u2014 but there is definitely a trend toward\nknowing more. And some of the most exciting developments in medicine\ncome from replacing human judgment with\n[checklists](http://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto) and [decision\ntrees](http://www.venchar.com/2005/02/emphasizing_the.html).\n\nBut medicine is probably the best-case scenario. I\u2019ve never heard of\nlawyers reading up on the results of [statistical\ntrials](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/11/justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges/)\nand aesthetics is so subjective and fashion so temporary that I doubt\nanything like this could ever be possible for interior designers.\n(Education is probably somewhere in the middle.) How do people ever get\ngood at these things?\n\n* * * * *\n\nPart of why running a nonprofit is so hard is that pretty much all\nnonprofits are delegation. Donors aren\u2019t buying a particular thing they\nknow they want, they\u2019re buying a chance to help others, without knowing\nexactly what it is *they* want. And that\u2019s why [randomized controlled\ntrials](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/about-j-pal) have been\ntransformational for the nonprofit sector \u2014 they\u2019ve converted a\ndelegation into a service. [Great nonprofits](http://www.givewell.org/)\ndon\u2019t have to guess at what will help people the most; they just need to\nlook up the most helpful service and then purchase more of it.\n\n*[Poor Economics](http://pooreconomics.com/)* is a remarkable book if\nonly because it shows how crucial this is. It\u2019s full of tales of\nsmall-scale experiments where well-intentioned do-gooders try hard to\nhelp some people and fail catastrophically. But they only notice because\nthere are academics there collecting data; in the typical nonprofit,\nwhere the decisionmakers are far removed from the evidence on the\nground, they\u2019d probably never know that much was going wrong ([assuming\nthat they even\ncared](http://byliner.com/originals/three-cups-of-deceit)).\n\nBut \u201cpolitical\u201d nonprofits don\u2019t get off so easily. It\u2019s fairly\nimpractical to do randomized controlled trials of things like lobbying,\npublic campaigning, white papers, investigative journalism, public\nrelations, strategic litigation, electoral campaigns, and the rest.\nThere are [brave and noble\nefforts](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/magazine/31politics-t.html?pagewanted=all)\nto try to improve some of the details most amenable to testing, but\nwhile you can test which direct mail flyer makes people more likely to\nvote, it\u2019s hard to test whether GOTV mail is a good use of campaign\nfunds at all.\n\nNow you can get a lot out of [combining all these\nthings](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ist) so you can make big-picture\ndecisions about how to allocate resources. And you can get a lot out of\nhaving the same team do them over and over so they can build up\ninstitutional expertise. But there\u2019s also a lot of room for learning\nwithin each one as well. Just as randomized controlled trials have\nrevolutionized development nonprofits, I think political nonprofits will\nbe revolutionized by developing institutional structures to formalize\nthe process of learning from campaigns.\n\nWhat would this look like? A good first step would be developing a\nseries of case studies of major campaigns, successful or unsuccessful,\nto get some sense of big picture stories. From this, you could distill a\ntoolbook of various tactics, with some notes on which seem to be more\nand less effective and some open questions or avenues of exploration for\neach. Then within each tactic, you could bring together practitioners to\nswap best practices and try to improve the state of the art.\n\nInterviewing people right after campaigns also seems like a fruitful\navenue. As they look back on what happened, what do they see as the big\nmistakes? The big successes? What do they wish they\u2019d had?\n\nThese might all seem like minor, parochial concerns, but when you stop\nto realize that the world is full of huge problems that can only be\nsolved by collective action, figuring out how to inspire coordinated\naction most effectively doesn\u2019t just seem interesting \u2014 it seems\nessential.\n", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann", "http://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto", "http://www.venchar.com/2005/02/emphasizing_the.html", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/11/justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges/", "http://www.povertyactionlab.org/about-j-pal", "http://www.givewell.org/", "http://pooreconomics.com/", "http://byliner.com/originals/three-cups-of-deceit", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/magazine/31politics-t.html?pagewanted=all"], "time": 1310972400.0, "postid": "delegation", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ist"]}, "romantic": {"post_title": "The Incurable Romantic", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Incurable Romantic\n======================\n\nMay 6, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/romantic)\n\n* * * * *\n\n> \u201cromantic\u201d\u2014a curious word meaning all things to all people.

Well, the basic process looks like this:\n\n1.  Read the news and look for a political fight that might interest\n    people.\n\n2.  Think of a way that ordinary people can get involved.\n\n3.  Write an email briefly explaining the issue and persuading people to\n    take action on it.\n\n4.  Channel those actions into a wider impact, e.g. by informing the\n    press, delivering petitions, running ads, etc.\n\nPeople who might be a good fit for this include political bloggers, who\nhave a lot of experience with 1 and 3, and people who have run campaigns\non local issues, giving them experience with 2 and 4. It\u2019s also helpful\nif you have experience with web design and HTML.\n\nBut the most important thing is just being creative and persuasive and\npassionate about the issues. Every campaign is different and each one\nhas to be run differently to seize people\u2019s attention. Someone who can\nthink outside the box and try something new each time is going to be\nmore successful than someone who\u2019s an expert at the standard way of\ndoing things.\n\nHaving done it myself, nothing competes with the thrill of running a\ncampaign. Instead of just getting upset about the news, you get to do\nsomething about it. You get to rally people to action, explain the story\nto the media, and really get into a fight with the bad guys. And every\nonce in a while you actually win a victory that improves the lives of\nmillions of people. It\u2019s ridiculously exciting, fun, and rewarding.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send a resume and a short note persuading me to\ntake some action to [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com) with\n\u201ccampaigner\u201d in the subject.\n", "external_links": ["mailto:me@aaronsw.com"], "time": 1280905200.0, "postid": "campaigners", "internal_links": []}, "howtolaunch": {"post_title": "How To Launch Software", "tags": ["tech and society", "startups"], "post_content": "How To Launch Software\n======================\n\nAugust 22, 2008\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/howtolaunch)\n\n* * * * *\n\n37signals recommends that software developers pursue what they call [the\nHollywood\nLaunch](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch13_Hollywood_Launch.php).\nThey don\u2019t give any argument for this method, except perhaps the title\n(as if Hollywood was a business you should try to imitate?) \u2014 I guess\nthe idea is that you\u2019re supposed to do it since 37signals says to.\n\nThe basic idea behind the Hollywood Launch is simple: you release a few\nhints about your product to build buzz, slowly revealing more and more\nuntil the big day, when you throw open the doors and people flood your\nsite, sent there by all the blog coverage and email alerts.\n\nThis may work well for Hollywood \u2014 if your movie is a big hit at the\nbox-office on opening weekend, then the movie theaters are more likely\nto keep showing it in the weeks to come and you get credit for being\n\u201cone of the weekend\u2019s biggest films\u201d. But for software developers, it\u2019s\nmoronic. Your software isn\u2019t being released in theaters, it\u2019s available\nover the Web. You don\u2019t have to worry about the theater no longer\nshowing after week one; you can keep pushing it for years, growing your\nuserbase.\n\nInstead what happens when software developers try the Hollywood Launch,\nand I\u2019ve seen this many times, is that users indeed do flood to your\nsite on launch day but\u2026\n\n1.  They bring the site down from the load. You scramble to get it back\n    up and succeed by coding like a mad man, only to find\u2026\n\n2.  They discover some big bug that you never quite noticed before,\n    which makes the whole thing look like embarrassing hackwork. (*What?\n    You forgot to test that last-minute JavaScript change in IE6 1/2?*)\n    So you\u2019re desperately rushing to fix the bug before the traffic dies\n    down, rush-patching things and restarting the server when\u2026\n\n3.  You bring the site down for everyone because there was a syntax\n    error in your patch that keeps the server from coming back up. You\n    fix it while cursing yourself madly. Finally everything seems to\n    work. You take a breath and decide to see what people are saying\n    about you on the Web, only to discover\u2026\n\n4.  Everyone misunderstood what your product does because your front\n    page wasn\u2019t clear enough. Now they all think it\u2019s stupid and wonder\n    aloud how you even know how to breathe. So you reply in all the\n    comment threads and fix your front page to ensure no one could\n    possibly misunderstand what it is you\u2019re doing just in time to find\u2026\n\n5.  All the traffic is gone.\n\nTomorrow, hardly any of those users come back. Your traffic graphs look\nlike the sharpest mountain you\u2019ve ever seen: a huge climb up and then,\nalmost immediately, a similarly-sized crash back down.\n\nSo what do you do then? Well, you do what you should have done all\nalong: you grow the site.\n\nI\u2019ll call this technique the Gmail Launch, since it\u2019s based on what\nGmail did. Gmail is probably one of the biggest Web 2.0 success stories,\nso there\u2019s an argument in its favor right there. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1.  Have users from day one. Obviously at the very beginning it\u2019ll just\n    be yourself and your co-workers, but as soon as you have something\n    that you don\u2019t cringe while using, you give it to your friends and\n    family. Keep improving it based on their feedback and once you have\n    something that\u2019s tolerable, let them invite their friends to use it\n    too.\n\n2.  Try to get lots of feedback from these new invitees, figuring out\n    what doesn\u2019t make sense, what needs to be fixed, and what things\n    don\u2019t work on their bizarre use case combination. Once these are all\n    straightened out, and they\u2019re using it happily, you let them invite\n    their friends. Repeat until things get big enough that you need to\u2026\n\n3.  Automate the process, giving everyone some invite codes to share. By\n    requiring codes, you protect against a premature slashdotting and\n    force your users to think carefully about who actually would want to\n    use it (getting them to do your marketing for you). Plus, you make\n    everyone feel special for using your product. (You can also start\n    (slowly!) sending invite codes to any email lists you might have.)\n\n4.  Iterate: give out invite codes, fix bugs, make sure things are\n    stable. Stay in this phase until the number of users you\u2019re willing\n    to invite is about the same as the number you expect will initially\n    sign up if you make the site public. For Gmail, this was a long\n    time, since a lot of people wanted invites. You can probably safely\n    do it sooner.\n\n5.  Take off the invite code requirement, so that people can use the\n    product just by visiting its front page. Soon enough, random people\n    will come across it from Google or various blogs and become real\n    users.\n\n6.  If all this works \u2014 if random people are actually happy with your\n    product and you\u2019re ready to grow even larger \u2014 *then* you can start\n    building buzz and getting press and blog attention. The best way to\n    do this is to have some kind of news hook \u2014 some gimmick or\n    controversial thing that everyone will want to talk about. (With\n    reddit, the big thing was that we switched from Lisp to Python,\n    which was discussed endlessly in the Lisp and Python communities and\n    gave us our first big userbase.)\n\n7.  Start marketing. Once you start using up all the growth you can get\n    by word-of-mouth (and this can take a while \u2014 Google is only getting\n    to this stage *now*), you can start doing advertising and other\n    marketing-type things to provide the next big boost in growth.\n\nThe result will be a graph that just keeps accelerating and climbing up.\nThat\u2019s the graph that everyone loves to see: solid growth, not a one-day\nwonder. Good luck.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSince 37signals quotes from people who followed their advice, I thought\nI might as well do the same.\n[mojombo](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=284057):\n\n> I find this to be excellent advice.

It\u2019s got a lot of attraction\nfor me. First, it\u2019s a big, bold, public labor battle \u2014 the kind you\ndon\u2019t see much anymore. And second, it\u2019s filled with people I know.\n(Yes, I\u2019m the dork who actually tries remember the names of the authors\nof the TV shows I watch.)\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been following, the story is something like this:\n[Amazingly](http://images.salon.com/comics/bolling961125.gif), Hollywood\ndoesn\u2019t consist of actors on soundstages simply saying the brilliant\nlines that come to them in the moment. Instead, people called \u201cwriters\u201d\nslave away in darkness to craft plots and dialogue which are then turned\ninto scripts for the rest of the people in Hollywood to follow.\n\nDespite their importance, writers haven\u2019t been given much due in\nHollywood. They work as employees for studios who pay them money in\nexchange for the copyrights to their scripts. Meanwhile, the studios\nthen turn the scripts into TV shows and movies that go on to run for\nyears, in reruns and syndication and on home video and DVDs and now on\nthe Internet thru streaming and download.\n\nWriters have banded together to form a union, called the Writers\u2019 Guild\nof America, to make sure that, just like authors of songs or books, they\nget paid when the things they write become a success. These payments are\ncalled \u201cresiduals\u201d and writers get them when their show reruns or is\nsold on DVD. The studios have a contract with the guild, and thus with\nall writers, specifying the minimum amounts they have to pay whenever\nsomething like that happens. The guild then audits the studios on behalf\nof the writers, makes sure they pay their fair share, and then\ndetermines which writers deserve the money and mails it out.\n\nStudios are still upset about having to pay writers for their work,\nwishing they could keep all the profits for themselves. Writers are\nstill upset about not having negotiated a better rate for home video\nresiduals. Right now, when you buy a TV show on DVD, the writers get\n0.3% of the price \u2014 something like six cents, usually. The studios want\nto pay them the same pitiful amount for online downloads and pay them\nnothing at all for online streaming. The writers, not surprisingly,\nwould like to get paid a more fair amount.\n\nSo when the contract between the studios and the guild expired weeks\nago, the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a replacement. The studios\nbasically refused to seriously negotiate and that refusal has been going\non (in various forms) ever since. So the writers went on strike: they\u2019re\nno longer allowed to write a single word for a studio until the contract\nissues get resolved.\n\nInstead, writers have been out picketing studio gates, making [clever\nvideos online](http://strikelife.net/%22notes%22.html), and trying to\nbring the studios to the table. As a result, much of television has gone\noff the air, because there are no new scripts to film. *The Daily Show*\nand other nightly comedy shows disappeared immediately, writer-run shows\nlike *The Office* soon after that, and most of the rest are disappearing\nas we speak. The studios are continuing to refuse to negotiate.\n\nAlong the way I\u2019ve learned a great deal about the arcanaties of labor\nlaw (many of which, like *Taft-Hartley*, are everyday words in\nHollywood), the oddities of Hollywood jargon (the Alphabet=ABC,\nhyphenates=writer-producers, etc.), and read many gripping stories about\nwhat it\u2019s like to be [fighting for your\nlivelihood](http://johnaugust.com/).

Abrams, the\ncreator of *Alias* and *Lost*, and his partner Damon Lindelof. Both are\nwriters and both are bound by the \u201cpencils down\u201d rule of the strike,\neven though they\u2019re in the middle of filming the new *Star Trek* film,\npresently Paramount\u2019s biggest movie.

A tobacco company must\nfind people willing to get kids addicted to cigarettes, a school must\nfind teachers willing to repeat the same things that they were taught, a\ngovernment must find public servants willing to enforce the law.\n\nPart of this is simply necessity. To survive, people need money; to get\nmoney, people need a job; to get a job, people need to find an existing\ninstitution. But the people in these positions don\u2019t usually see\nthemselves as mercenaries, doing the smallest amount to avoid getting\nfired while retaining their own value system. Instead, they adopt the\nvalue system of the institution, pushing it even when it\u2019s not necessary\nfor their own survival. What explains this pattern of conformance?\n\nThe most common explanation is an active process of beating people in:\npoliticians get paid campaign contributions (legalized bribes) to meet\nthe needs of the wealthy, employees get bonuses and penalties for\nmeeting the needs of their employers, kids get threatened with time-outs\nand bad grades if they don\u2019t follow the demands of their teachers. In\neach case, the people are forced through a series of carrots and sticks\nto learn the values of the people in charge.\n\nThis is a fairly blatant form of conformance, but I suspect it\u2019s by far\nthe least effective. Studies on punishment and rewards show that dealing\nthem out lessens the victim\u2019s identification with the enforcer. Hitting\nme every time I don\u2019t do my job right may teach me how to do my job, but\nit\u2019s not going to make me particularly excited about it.\n\nIndeed, punishments and rewards interfere with a much more significant\neffect: cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance studies have found\nthat simply by getting you to do something, you can be persuaded to\nagree with it. In a classic study, students asked to write an essay in\nfavor of a certain position were found to agree more with the position\nthan students who could write for either position. Similarly, people who\npay more to eat a certain food claim to like it more than people who pay\nless.\n\nThe basic theory is that people work to lessen the disagreement between\ntheir beliefs and their actions and in most cases it\u2019s simply easier to\nchange your beliefs. Quitting your job for the government is tough and\npainful; and who knows if you\u2019ll soon find another? So it\u2019s much easier\nto simply persuade yourself that you agree with the government, that\nyou\u2019re doing the right and noble thing, that your work to earn a\npaycheck is really a service to mankind.\n\nOf course, it also helps that everyone you\u2019re surrounded by feels the\nsame way. Culture is another important influence on our beliefs. Another\nraft of social psychology studies find that people are willing to deny\neven obvious truths to fit in with a group. In the famous Asch studies\non conformance, a group of confederates were seated around a table, with\nthe subject of the experiment on the end. Everyone at the table was\ngiven a sheet with three lines, one obviously longer than the other, and\nthen was asked to name the two lines of identical length. All of the\nconfederates gave an obviously wrong answer and by the time the question\ngot to the guy at the end, he ended up conforming and giving the wrong\nanswer as well.\n\nSimilarly, spend your days in government offices where people simply\ntake it for granted that they\u2019re doing the right thing, and you\u2019re\nlikely to pick up that tacit assumption yourself. Such ideas are not\nonly frequently stated, they\u2019re often the very foundation of the\ndiscussion. And foundational ideas are particularly hard to question,\nparticularly because they\u2019re so taken for granted.\n\nBut perhaps the most important effect for conformance is simply\nselection. Imagine that nobody was corruptible, that all the carrots and\nsticks in the world couldn\u2019t get someone to do something they thought\nmorally wrong, that they stood fast in the face of cognitive dissonance,\nand that their moral fiber was so strong that they were able to resist a\nless conscientious culture. Even then, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference.\nAs long as there was enough variety in people and their moral values,\nall an organization would need to do is simply fire (or fail to promote)\neveryone who didn\u2019t play their game.\n\nEveryone knows you climb the corporate ladder by being a \u201cteam player\u201d.\nThose who make a fuss or don\u2019t quite live up to expectations simply get\npassed over for a promotion. The result is simply that \u2014 without any\nexplicit pressure at all \u2014 the people in positions of power happen to be\nthe ones who identify with the organization\u2019s aims.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to look at the rather more flashy pieces of punishing people\nfor failing to follow orders or living in a culture of conformity. But\nfor those who want obedient employees, sometimes the most effective\ntechnique is simply failing to say yes.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1167292800.0, "postid": "conformancing", "internal_links": []}, "godel": {"post_title": "Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt G\u00f6del", "tags": [], "post_content": "Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt G\u00f6del\n===================================================\n\nFebruary 12, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/godel)\n\n* * * * *\n\n[![Book cover](image1_godel)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393327604)\n\nG\u00f6del was a hacker.

Others might try to argue them out of it.\nNot G\u00f6del. Perhaps (rightly) he thought that rational argument would get\nhim nowhere with people so detached from reality. So he decided to\n*prove* them wrong.\n\nThe result was G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem, one of the most\ncelebrated results in mathematics and logic, elegantly proving that any\nmathematical system complicated enough to do basic arithmetic contains\nstatements which, while true, cannot be proven within the system.\n\nBut even this was to no avail, the Vienna Circle continued to insist the\nproof was bogus or irrelevant.

It was an unseasonably gorgeous fall\nday, bright sunlight glinting of the color-changing trees and making\neverything look golden, the air warm and comfortable. I walked to my\npolling place, just blocks away, in the basement of city hall. The line\nstretched out the door and around the building. It was clear this was no\nordinary election. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d one old-timer\ncommented. \u201cI\u2019ve never voted here before,\u201d another explained.\n\nAn elderly man brought a chair to sit on while he waited, I chatted with\nfriends I spotted behind me in line \u2014 it seemed as if the whole\nneighborhood was here. Nobody minded. Spirits were bright and the\npollworkers seemed almost giddy at getting to oversee the process. Few\nof the elections were contested and the winner of the Massachusetts\u2019\nelectoral votes was a foregone conclusion, but everyone felt a need to\nbe there.\n\nI grabbed some breakfast and dispatched some errands and then grabbed my\ncompanion for the trip to nearby New Hampshire. The night before I had\npersuaded her to drive me up and volunteer. A swing state, just an hour\naway, I pointed out. Won\u2019t it be fun to join in one of the biggest and\nmost impressive volunteer operations in history? Convinced, we set the\nGPS for Manchester City Center and drove off toward history.\n\nManchester is not a big city. Elm, its main drag, is crammed with office\nbuildings and city hall and sports stadiums side-by-side as if no one\nwould find them if they were spread farther apart. If it gives off any\nimpression, it\u2019s one of New England homeiness: brownstone buildings,\ndivey diners with pizza and subs. Wandering the streets, I couldn\u2019t help\nbut think of Jed Bartlett bundled against the cold, buttonholing a\nsenior staffer. I literally bounced with excitement. The streets were\nfilled with optimism and it seemed like every street bum and cashier and\nradio was talking about the election.\n\nThe Obama office was on Elm Street, just further down, as the buildings\nthinned out and begun to look somewhat abandoned. Next door were what\nlooked like abandoned carpet showrooms turned into headquarters for\nlocal political campaigns, a huge billboard proclaiming \u201cSUNUNU\u201d loomed\nin the distance. Behind it was a packed parking lot in front of an\nelegant cemetery. We parked the car and headed back around to the front\ndoor, passing laughing kids carrying doorhangers, rows of portapotties,\na mountain of discarded pizza boxes, and a few big bags of plastic\nbottles and packaged lunches.\n\nShy at the best of times, I couldn\u2019t summon the courage and walk through\nthe door and lay myself on the line \u2014 so I pushed my companion to do it\nfirst. The notion filled her with dread and, clutching her stomach, she\nran back around to the portapotties to vomit. \u201cYou can\u2019t just expect me\nto march into a campaign office with no warning like that,\u201d she\ncomplained. \u201cYou need to sign up, get an assignment, pick a shift.\u201d I\ndisagreed, pointing to a couple emails I\u2019d gotten on my phone urging me\nto head down to the closest Obama office as quickly as possible. She was\nnot persuaded. At a stalemate, we decided to go grab some pizza and\nsummon our courage.\n\nNewly fortified, I bravely marched into the office. Stairs led up to a\nreceiving platform. One door was labeled phonebanking, another\ncanvassing, and an office seemed to lie behind the front desk. At the\ntop of the stairs peering out over the railing stood a broad-shouldered\nguy in a green shirt. \u201cYou here to volunteer?\u201d he asked us as we walked\nin. \u201cHow can we help?\u201d I asked. \u201cPerfect!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on up here.\u201d\n\nOnce we were within his sights, he began his spiel, full of energy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making history today! This is the most important election of our\nlifetime and we need you to help. And the way you\u2019re going to make\nhistory\u201d\u2014 he grabbed a manila folder off the counter \u2014\u201cis by going to\ngoing to Sandown.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the girl sitting behind the front desk.\n\u201cBedford.\u201d He placed the file back and grabbed a new one from the girl.\n\u201cForget Sandown, you\u2019re not going to make history in Sandown. You\u2019re\ngoing to make history in Bedford.\u201d\n\nA couple young girls walked in, also wanting to volunteer, and he\nquickly pulled them into our group. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make history today\nin Bedford. We need to get every single person out to the polls.\u201d He\nopened the file and pulled out a map. \u201cNow what you\u2019re going to do is\nhead over to our Bedford staging area and they\u2019re going to give you your\nassignment.\u201d He handed out directions and made sure everyone understood.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s not going to be a big building like this \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a\nhouse we\u2019re borrowing with a ton of cars parked outside.\u201d We all nodded.\n\n\u201cSounds good? Are you fired up? Ready to go? Let\u2019s make history!\nRemember \u2014 we\u2019re counting on you. Oh, one more thing\u2014\u201d he turned to one\nof the girls. \u201cDid you vote for change today?\u201d She nodded. He handed her\na \u201cI voted for change\u201d Obama sticker. \u201cDid you vote for change today?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d Sticker. \u201cDid you vote for change today?\u201d \u201cI voted for change\nweeks ago,\u201d my companion explained. He grinned and handed her a sticker.\nAnd I got one too. \u201cNow let\u2019s make history!\u201d And with this enthusiastic\nsendoff, we headed back to our cars to drive to Bedford.\n\nBedford is a sleepy little suburban town with houses three times the\nsize of San Francisco mansions and lawns bigger than the houses. As\npromised, the Bedford staging center was one of them, with cars filling\nthe enormous driveway and stretching out onto the street. As we walked\nthe path up to the front door, little signs had been posted in the\ngrass, together spelling out a quote from Barack Obama about the\nimportance of activism and change, a couple sentences at a time.\n\nInside was the typical suburban home, except filled with campaign\nworkers milling around. It reminded me a bit of what it looks like when\nsomeone\u2019s house is borrowed for filming. \u201cWater and granola to the left,\ncanvas packets to the right,\u201d someone explained. We headed right, into\nthe living room, where a man behind a table was lecturing to a group of\nmaybe twenty or thirty people. He was just finishing up as we arrived.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve talked for long enough. But here\u2019s the basic idea. You go\nthru the packet, you find people who weren\u2019t home or hadn\u2019t voted yet,\nyou knock on their doors and you mark the result down. Got it?\u201d People\nnodded, grabbed their clipboards, and headed out. We went up and grabbed\na clipboard of our own. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d we asked. \u201cYou say: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m\nhere for change. We need change this election. And Barack Obama and\nJeanne Shaheen are the change we need.\u2019 (We support Lynch too but he\ndoesn\u2019t need our help.) This isn\u2019t like normal canvassing. If you spend\nmore than a minute at a house you\u2019re doing it wrong. And you need to\ntake your car\u2014houses here are so far apart that it can take three\nminutes to walk from one to another.\u201d We grabbed some doorhangers and\nheaded off, leaving our name and number on a sheet indicating who was\nworking which turf. Kids were wandering around the apartment chatting as\nwe left. We certainly weren\u2019t the only ones who had driven up from\nBoston. Outside, the signs in this direction read \u201cFired up? Ready to\ngo!\u201d\n\nCanvassing in the suburbs seems about the last thing any kid would want\nto spend your day doing. Here\u2019s how it works: You\u2019re given a clipboard\nwith a list of people. Each one has a name, age, gender, address, and\nsometimes a phone number. They\u2019re sorted by address. You find their\nhouse, park outside, walk down their (looong) driveway, and knock on the\ndoor. Usually, they\u2019re not home and you check \u201cnot home\u201d on the\nclipboard and stick a doorhanger (which says \u201cVOTE OBAMA TODAY\u201d, gives\npolling place information, and explains that college students and\nunregistered people can still vote) on the door. You could tell the\nfolks who were out-of-town because they had a whole collection of\ndoorhangers, each one more urgent than the next \u2014 \u201cVOTE OBAMA NOV. 4\u201d,\n\u201cVOTE OBAMA TUESDAY\u201d, \u201cVOTE OBAMA TODAY!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably the best case. If they\u2019re home, you awkwardly try to\nexplain why you\u2019re out here in the middle of nowhere knocking on their\ndoor, and ask them to go vote. It was late in the day and our walk\npacket had already been walked once before, so everyone we met had\nalready voted, for Obama naturally. (The exception was one couple who we\nencountered walking to their car. They were heading out to vote, they\nassured us.)\n\nThe first few times I was too nervous to say anything and let my\ncompanion do all the talking, but after a few times of seeing what\npeoples\u2019 reaction were like (positive, friendly, and filled with\nassurances they\u2019d already voted for Obama) I begun speaking up and then\nsplitting the workload.\n\nOut in the suburbs, you spend most of the time hunting for the right\nhouse numbers (our walk list was careful to only include known\nsupporters, which meant most houses were skipped) and walking back to\nyour car. You get to see people, but not a particularly wide variety and\nnot for very long. A handful were very friendly and expressed their\nappreciation that we were volunteering. One asked us to leave extra\ndoorhangers for her husband to see. (Naturally, her husband was not on\nour list of Obama supporters.) It was wildly unrewarding work and it\nquickly got late, forcing us to walk alongside streets without sidewalks\nin the dark. (We hadn\u2019t thought to bring flashlights.) Toward the end, I\nran into the one woman who was mean to us. Refusing the open the door\nshe shouted thru the window at me, angry I\u2019d interrupted her cooking\ndinner. (Of course she\u2019d already voted.) Tired and frustrated, we headed\nback to the staging center, only 3/4 of the way through the packet.\n\nBack at the staging center, college girls were chatting with the house\u2019s\nowner, a well-coiffed woman with gold earrings and a pink sweater. Was\nthe kid running things here their son, they asked? \u201cKerry? Oh no, he\u2019s\njust a volunteer who\u2019s been living here for the campaign.\u201d Kerry, for\nhis part, was packing up and heading for Manchester. Like a professional\nentertainer, his enthusiastic demeanor had been packed up too. He was\nupset to hear we hadn\u2019t made it through the whole walklist, but cheered\nup when he learned it was one that had already been walked. \u201cFind any\nnonvoters?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cexcept for one couple we caught on\ntheir way to vote.\u201d \u201cYeah, people here, they need a nudge maybe, but\nthey\u2019re going to vote. Not like people in Manchester. There you gotta\npick \u2018em up, walk \u2018em to the polls, stand next to them in line, and then\nstand behind them as they swear the affidavits.\u201d (New voters without ID\nor proof of address can vote by swearing an affidavit, as the doorhanger\nexplained.) He didn\u2019t sound enthusiastic, just grimly determined.\n\n\u201cYou know, New Hampshire was once won by just a couple hundred votes?\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said, putting on my best isn\u2019t-volunteering-important? tone.\n\u201cOf course, that was like a hundred years ago, but still.\u201d And with\nthat, Kerry rushed out, telling one volunteer to email him and wishing\nhim luck with college.\n\nThe college girls were still chatting. \u201cWow, this is some good pizza,\u201d\nthey said. \u201cHah,\u201d said the house\u2019s owner, \u201cpeople think you can only get\ngood pizza in Boston, but Bedford proves otherwise.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to\nhead back to Boston \u2014 we\u2019ve all got election parties.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much left to do here and with just 45 minutes until the\npolls closed, chasing downtown voters to the polls didn\u2019t sound like\nmuch fun, so we decided to head back to Boston as well. Things were\npretty clear by the time we got there, but we dutifully watched the TV\nand Web as the networks inched closer to calling it. When they finally\ndid, we could hear honks and cheers go up from outside our window.\n\nMcCain quickly conceded \u2014 even before the polls in Alaska had closed \u2014\nand Obama\u2019s acceptance speech followed shortly thereafter. It was a\ncalm, studied affair. There were no big surprises \u2014 everything turned\nout basically as had been predicted for the past month. \u201cAt this point,\nFiveThirtyEight is just spoilers,\u201d my companion observed. I didn\u2019t feel\nmuch enthusiasm, just relief. It had happened. It had really truly\nhappened. We sat quietly and let it sink in.\n\nApparently we were in the minority when it came to quiet acceptance.\nOutside, we could hear drums banging and horns honking and people\nscreaming by. Harvard Square begun filling up with cheering people, as\nfar as the eye could see. I\u2019ve never seen it so packed \u2014 folks said it\nwas even bigger than when the Red Sox won the World Series. Even the\npolice seem jubilant. \u201cWere you expecting this?\u201d someone asked them. \u201cWe\nshould have\u2026\u201d\n\nThe procession marched down Mass Ave, the city\u2019s main street, picking up\npeople on the sidewalk as it went. Flags were hoisted, signs were waved,\npeople chanted \u201cYes We Did!\u201d and \u201cTime For Peace!\u201d (\u201cWhat do we want?\u201d\n\u201cChange!\u201d \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d \u201cNow!\u201d) \u201cChange begins tomorrow\u201d became\n\u201cChange starts now\u201d.\n\nThe police became increasingly aggravated at the march without a permit\nand cop cars began flashing their sirens and trying to force people onto\nthe sidewalk while shouting at us with their megaphones. Folks were\npissed at them \u2014 there was some talk about fighting back or smashing the\nGap we passed \u2014 but cooler heads prevailed and folks just kept marching.\n\nFinally, we headed into the new parkish thing outside Toscanini\u2019s and\nsomeone jumped on top of a table to give a speech. \u201cDon\u2019t stand on that,\nplease,\u201d one of the cops asked, \u201cit was named for one of my guys.\u201d He\nstood on top of a concrete embankment instead. I recognized a few faces\nin the crowd and it became clear I wasn\u2019t the only one who was back from\nNew Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe did this!\u201d the guy on the concrete shouted. \u201cThrough our voting and\nour volunteering, we changed this country. Making change won\u2019t be easy,\nbut tonight we celebrate that we\u2019ve changed who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d\nThe cops snickered. Another kid jumped on top of the concrete. \u201cAnd pot\nis legal!\u201d he screamed. \u201cDecriminalized!\u201d shouted the cops.

There seems to be a surge\nof interest in the topic lately, so I thought I\u2019d write up my\nlongstanding thoughts.*\n\nThe academy is often thought of as the ideal for developing knowledge:\nselect the brightest minds in the country, guarantee them jobs, allow\nthem all the resources they need to research anything, don\u2019t interfere\nwith any of their conclusions. On some issues, these independent-minded\nacademics form a consensus and we tend to give their consensus very\nheavy weight. They can\u2019t all be wrong, can they?\n\nAnd yet, in my empirical research, I find they very often are. A short\nblog post is no place to do a careful study, but I can mention some\nexamples. The classic works in industrial relations turn out to be\ncomplete hoaxes, yet they\u2019ve dominated the teach of the field for over\nhalf a century. (See [Alex Carey\u2019s\nbook](http://books.theinfo.org/go/086840358X) for details.) In political\nscience, the most respected practioner\u2019s most famous work shades and\ndistorts his own findings to support a theory wildly at odds with the\nfacts. (See [*Who Really\nRules?*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whoreallyrules)) The whole field\nof fMRI studies are so flat-out ridiculous that journal articles are\neven [making jokes about\nthem](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/09/dead-salmon-responds-to-portra.html).\nAnd, maybe most blatantly today, economics was dominated by a paradigm\nthat believed substantive unemployment was impossible, despite that\nnotion having been famously and thoroughly debunked by Keynes and, of\ncourse, reality.\n\nHow is this possible? I think the key, as in most institutional studies,\nis that of the filter. To become a professor of X, one must first spend\nseveral years receiving an undergraduate major in X, then several more\nyears going to graduate school in X, then perhaps work as a postdoc or\nadjunct for a bit, before getting a tenure-track position and working\nlike mad to make enough of a dent in the field of X to be seen as\ndeserving of a prominent permanent position. When your time is called, a\npanel of existing professors of X passes judgment on your work to decide\nif it passes muster. Can you imagine a better procedure for forcing\nimpressionable young minds to believe crazy things?\n\nAnd so this process forms what I call disciplinary bubbles. Take the\ncase of industrial relations for a moment. The field was largely created\nby the Rockefellers, who wanted research into how they could get rid of\ntheir unions. They paid lavishly and, not surprisingly, found people who\ntold them what they wanted to hear: that treating workers nicely made\nunions unnecessary and companies more efficient. The studies were\ncompletely bogus but the people who conducted them were hailed as\nheroes, and provided with lavish funding to continue their research. The\nfunding started new departments which trained new proteges, each of whom\nwas taught that the founding studies as gospel. They were told to work\non expanding and refining the results, not results, not questioning\nthen, and so they did, becoming industrial relations professors in their\nown right and continuing the cycle.\n\nLike other bubbles, disciplinary bubbles are difficult to pop. Imagine\nyou do research outside their incorrect assumptions. Your research will\nsimply be marginalized and ignored \u2014 you don\u2019t get into the conferences\nor the journals, it\u2019s just not seen as valid work. And even if you try\nto disprove the bogus assumptions, you get ignored. Everyone already in\nthe field has built their careers on those assumptions. They\u2019ve long\nrationalized them to themselves; nobody is going to support someone who\nargues their life\u2019s work is built on sand.\n\nThus ignorance marches on.\n", "external_links": ["http://books.theinfo.org/go/086840358X", "http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/09/dead-salmon-responds-to-portra.html"], "time": 1256022000.0, "postid": "disciplinarybubbles", "internal_links": ["http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whoreallyrules"]}, "thinkbetter": {"post_title": "Tips for Better Thinking", "tags": [], "post_content": "Tips for Better Thinking\n========================\n\nDecember 15, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thinkbetter)\n\n* * * * *\n\nGo to the library and you\u2019ll find whole bookcases full of books on how\nto write better. But look for a book on how to *think* better and you\u2019ll\nbe busy for a while. (The only major book I could find \u2014 *Crimes Against\nLogic* \u2014 was a dreadful little series of basic logical fallacies dressed\nup in political polemic.)\n\nIt can\u2019t be that writing is more important than thinking. While I\u2019ve met\nmany people who can\u2019t exactly write, it seems that just about everyone\nhas to think \u2014 even writers. Nor do I think it\u2019s that the task is really\nharder. We know very little about the internal process of writing, so\nwriting guides consist mostly of good and bad examples, along with some\ngeneral rules. Surely one could do the same for thought.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that there isn\u2019t such a thing as good thinking.\nBut the case for it seems even stronger than the case for good writing.\nGood thinking is that which better helps us approximate reality \u2014\navoiding fallacies, missteps of judgment, faulty assumptions,\nmisunderstandings, and needless fillips and loops.\n\nAnd yet the subject\u2019s plain importance, I can find scarcely an article\nthat takes up the topic. Where is the piece that savages bad thinking\nthe way [Mark Twain savaged Fenimore Cooper\u2019s aimless\nwriting](http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_fenimore.html)\nor the way [Orwell went after political abuses of\nEnglish](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit)\nor, for more modern readers, [Matt Taibbi\u2019s dissection of Thomas\nFriedman\u2019s latest\nbook](http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/21856/)? It seems like it\nwould be just as fun \u2014 if not more \u2014 to watch a gifted writer slice and\ndice up a convoluted thought until it becomes apparent that it\u2019s\nactually meaningless.\n\nThe closest I can think of is [Chomsky\u2019s review of B.F.\nSkinner](http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19711230.htm) (an unfair\nmatch-up if there ever was one \u2014 a bit like using a blow torch to clear\noff a dust mite). But Chomsky\u2019s attacking Skinner\u2019s ideas rather\nspecifically (and, more generally, exposing the political implications\nbehind bogus science); the essay is certainly not one in a series of\nexamples of how to think better.\n\nAs one gets more skilled, the opportunities for improvement become less\navailable \u2014 apparently because fewer people are interested in improving.\nThe library gives free courses in how to read better, but these are for\npeople who have trouble reading long books, not for those who already\ncan but want to continue to improve. And there are courses in improving\nyour writing, but they generally only get you from awful to serviceable,\nand not from serviceable to great. The same seems true of thinking \u2014\nthere are many books on fairly blatant logical fallacies to avoid, but\nfew on more subtle improvements to thought.\n\nAnd yet, at least with writing, people try. There are English courses in\nschools, [taught by some of the greatest writers of the\ngeneration](http://english.syr.edu/cwp/saunders.htm). And journalists\ncan semi-apprentice themselves by freelancing before great editors, who\nslice and dice their prose until it shines. Yet I\u2019ve never seen a class\nor an apprenticeship in thinking, except perhaps incidentally.\n\nThe reason, I think, is because no one is [thinking\nbigger](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thinkbigger).

Partly\nbecause it\u2019s so cliched (everyone\u2019s doing it), partly because it\u2019s so\nephemeral, partly because it\u2019s just boring. But I think the situation\nObama\u2019s found himself in has larger resonances and coming up with a\nsolution to it is genuinely difficult.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been following things, the story is this. There\nare two candidates: Barack Obama, a young centrist Democrat who bills\nhimself as the post-partisan candidate of \u201cchange\u201d (i.e. not Bush), and\nJohn McCain, a fairly non-ideological 72-year-old Republican who has\ndecided to give up on his centrist inclinations and run far to the\nright. For the first half of the campaign, Obama\u2019s message has been that\nhe\u2019s change while McCain is more of the same (visual: McCain hugging\nBush). McCain has argued that he\u2019s got experience and courage while\nObama is not ready to lead.\n\nThis was exactly the campaign Obama had planned on and their strategy\nwas working perfectly; McCain was behind just about the whole time. So\nMcCain decided to shake things up and picked Sarah Palin, an unknown,\nfar-right woman to be VP and began campaigning on them being \u201cthe\noriginal mavericks\u201d. (McCain\u2019s lack of ideology led the press to call\nhim a maverick for signing onto some liberal bills; Palin won her seat\nthrough a primary challenge against corrupt Alaska Republicans.) Palin\nis wildly inexperienced (and so is being kept from the press) and most\nof her claims to be anti-corruption are complete lies, but the press has\nbeen half-hearted in pointing this out.\n\nSo that\u2019s the recap. Now the problem. Whenever they\u2019re stuck,\nconservatives have two traditional responses: swift-boating and\nprojection. Swift-boating is taking your opponent\u2019s main asset and\nmaking it a liability. The classic example is taking John Kerry\u2019s\nvenerated war service and arguing that it was a fraud. But it can be\nused more generally as well. So when someone says \u201cWe need to increase\nwelfare to help the poor,\u201d the conservatives reply \u201cWelfare doesn\u2019t help\nthe poor \u2014 it just encourages them to be lazier.\u201d Projection is take\nyour opponent\u2019s main asset and claiming it to be your own. The classic\nexample here is that when the media is doing an effective job of\nparroting your story, you get out in front and complain that it spends\nits time parroting your *opponent\u2019s* story. The projection response to\nwelfare is \u201cNo, we\u2019re the ones who really want to help the poor \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019re proposing an ownership society.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tough to swift-boat Obama on the issue of change. He\u2019s young, he\u2019s\nblack, he\u2019s a Democrat. Calling him more of the same just seems\nlaughable. But, because of McCain\u2019s history, saying that McCain is also\nfor change has more resonance.\n\nSo what does Obama do? Whichever direction he goes, McCain will just\nfollow him there. If Obama says he\u2019s for *real* change, McCain will just\nsay he\u2019s for real change too. To voters, it\u2019ll seem like a toss-up.\nWorse, a lot of Obama\u2019s electoral strategy hinges on his massive\non-the-ground team of volunteers bringing out new voters. If he goes\nnegative (the obvious response), he\u2019ll take the campaign down into a\nmud-slinging match and turn all those new voters off. The only way to\nwin is to go someplace McCain can\u2019t. And the one place McCain can\u2019t go\nis the issues. (Gasp! We might actually have to talk about issues.)\n\nMcCain\u2019s plans have been the most nutzoid right-wing proposals: end\nemployer-paid health care, permanent bases in Iraq, tax cuts for the\nrich, and head-in-the-sand about energy. They\u2019re big juicy targets. But\nso far, Obama has been incompetent about going after them. Whenever his\nads begin talking about issues, they suddenly switch into policy-wonk\nmode and begin using so many long words that even I don\u2019t understand\nwhat he\u2019s going on about. And when they criticize John McCain they just\nseem like they\u2019re making stuff up. To win, Obama\u2019s ads will have to make\nthe issues sexy \u2014 he\u2019ll have to find a way to make talking about policy\nentertaining.\n\nCrazy as that sounds, it isn\u2019t impossible. There\u2019s real substance to\nthese policy disagreements \u2014 they\u2019re genuinely interesting. John McCain,\nfor example, thinks the big problem with health care in America is that\npeople have too much of it. Employers buy health care in bulk for all\ntheir workers, whether they need it or not. Instead, he thinks each\nAmerican should pay for health care on their own. That\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s\nsubstantive crazy.\n\nInstead of taking the campaign further into the mud, Obama will seem as\nif he\u2019s raising it back up to talk about the issues. Hell, the media\nmight even feel the pressure and start talking about issues themselves.\nIt\u2019s too late in the game for McCain to rewrite all his policy\nproposals, so he\u2019ll either have to try to defend them (a complete losing\nbattle) or he\u2019ll have to keep slinging mud at someone who is trying to\nhave a serious discussion. Either way, he looks bad.\n\nI have no idea if the Obama campaign is going to do anything like this.\nBut it\u2019s the only way I see out of their rut.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1221462000.0, "postid": "nextobama", "internal_links": []}, "archive": {"post_title": "The Archives", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Archives\n============\n\nOctober 22, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/archive)\n\n* * * * *\n\n**[What is going on here?](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/about)**\n\npolitics and parody\n-------------------\n\n-   [Comprehensive Response to All Arguments Against Gay\n    Marriage](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001037)\n-   [Our Brave Censors](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001085)\n-   [Contest: What has Bush Done for\n    You](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001103)\n-   [Counterpoint: Downloading Isn\u2019t\n    Stealing](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001112)\n-   [Jefferson: Nature Wants Information to Be\n    Free](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001115)\n-   [Bush Fear](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001119)\n-   [Sue For Freedom: Saving Steamboat\n    Roy](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001179)\n-   [President Bush: Why Can\u2019t He Stop\n    Lying](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001188)\n-   [[REDACTED]](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001225)\n-   [Gerrymandering: How Politicans Steal Votes and You Can Return\n    Them](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001171)\n-   [Up is Down: How Stating the False Hides the\n    True](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001173)\n-   [Watch the Comedians: The Daily\n    Show](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/001347)\n-   [Why is Big Media Losing Viewers?

Out\n====================\n\nNovember 14, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/markcooling)\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou run into a man at a party. You strike up a conversation. He seems\nvery friendly. You like him. And then he tells you about some friends he\nhas. This man is called the roper.\n\nThe friends tell you about a deal. They know about a gamble, but it\u2019s\nrigged so you can\u2019t lose. Just give them some money and they\u2019ll show\nyou. This is called the con.\n\nThe first time you give them money it works; it comes back ten-fold. But\nnow you\u2019re getting greedy. You want to do it again, bigger this time.\nOnly this time their money doesn\u2019t come back. This is called the loss.\n\nYou feel like a chump. Your greediness got the best of you. You want to\nget back at those con-men. You are called the mark.\n\nBut the roper talks you down. You can\u2019t go to the police without\nadmitting that you were trying to commit a crime. And everybody has to\nlose sometime, right? It could be worse. This is called cooling out the\nmark.\n\nErving Goffman, the great sociologist, [noticed this decades\nago](http://www.tau.ac.il/~algazi/mat/Goffman--Cooling.htm). Only he\ndidn\u2019t just notice it in con men. Students had to be persuaded to accept\na world far less idealistic than they learned in school. Kids who failed\nthe bar exam had to persuade themselves they didn\u2019t really want to be\nlawyers. People at restaurants had to be persuaded to accept the screwup\nby the kitchen. Everyone occasionally needs \u201cschooling in the philosophy\nof taking a loss.\u201d\n\nIt was this last example that particularly struck me. The other day, I\nwas watching [a video clip of a motivational\nspeaker](http://www.customersarealways.com/2007/03/lessons_from_james_arthur_ray.html).\nAnd what did he talk about? A screwup by a restaurant he went to. And\nhow the host worked hard, overhard even, to pacify him about it.\n\nIt was a decent story. It was very well told. But why was a motivational\nspeaker telling it? But now I realize: it was about cooling out the\nmark.\n\nCooling out marks is how institutions persuade people to accept things\nthey think are wrong. The con-man convinces you getting stolen from is\nOK. Your job convinces you it\u2019s OK that they\u2019re corrupt. The restaurant\npersuades you it\u2019s OK that they\u2019re incompetent.\n\nMotivational speakers do the same thing. Did the economy cheat you, fire\nyou, stick you in some crappy job with a crabby boss? Listen, the\nmotivational speaker explains, it\u2019s not the economy\u2019s fault. And just as\nthe roper is always separate from the con men, the motivational speaker\ndoesn\u2019t directly work for the economy. He sits on the sidelines, waiting\nto cool the mark out.\n\n-   Further reading: Barbara Ehrenreich, *[Bait and\n    Switch](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805081240)*\n\n", "external_links": ["http://www.tau.ac.il/~algazi/mat/Goffman--Cooling.htm", "http://www.customersarealways.com/2007/03/lessons_from_james_arthur_ray.html", "http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805081240"], "time": 1195027200.0, "postid": "markcooling", "internal_links": []}, "visitingmit": {"post_title": "I Love the University", "tags": [], "post_content": "I Love the University\n=====================\n\nJuly 26, 2006\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visitingmit)\n\n* * * * *\n\nI went to visit a friend today at MIT. The past few days I\u2019d been\nreading more stuff from academia and just that morning I was reading\nresponses to my old posts at Stanford, so academia\u2019s siren song had been\non my mind. But getting off the subway at MIT, with me full of energy\nafter a morning jog, the sun shining brightly down, I couldn\u2019t help but\nfeel like I was missing something, seeing smiles on the faces of the\nyoung geniuses who were everywhere around me.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s natural, when doing something so greedy and practical as a\nstartup, to pine for the idealized world of academia. Its image as a\nplace in an idyllic location filled with smart people has always been\nattractive; even more so with the sense that by being there one can get\nsmarter simply through osmosis. People describe a place of continual\ngeekiness, of throwing chemicals into the river and building robots in\nfree time. A magical place for hackers to just enjoy themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy my work; it\u2019s just that I feel like I\u2019m\ngetting dumber doing it. Or, at least, that I\u2019m not getting as smart as\nI should.\n\nThis academaphilia isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s clearly what drove magazines like\nLingua Franca and makes saying obscure names and words so impressive.\nBut for some reason it feels stronger now. I\u2019ve started downloading\nclass syllabuses off the Web and doing the reading assignments at night;\nI\u2019ve started thinking about how to sneak into courses and hang out with\nacademics. In Cambridge, this paradise seems so close, so acessible.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s hardly paradise at all. When I was actually there I was\nturned off by the conformism, the lack of interest in real work, the\npolitics, the pointless assignments. My lunch date is a grad student and\nhe tells me of the internecine squabbles, the overspecialization, the\nabandonment, the insecurity.\n\nI go back to the W3C\u2019s offices and stand at the balcony. Down below, Tim\nBerners-Lee discusses details of a project with a group of kids who\npresumably took this on as summer job. I was once one of those kids,\nworking there, and I think about why I left and why I miss it. I marvel\nat the pointlessness, the impracticality, the waste.\n\nThe sky is overcast now, the crowds of students have thinned out, and\nthose that remain scurry from place to place with their heads down. I\u2019m\ntired now, I feel sadder, and I wonder how I lost so much so quickly.\n\nI want to feel nostalgic, I want to feel like there\u2019s this place, just a\ncouple subway stops away, where everything will be alright. A better\nplace, a place I should be in, a place I can go back to. But even just\nvisiting it, the facts are plain. It doesn\u2019t exist, it never has. I\u2019m\nnostalgic for a place that never existed.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1153897200.0, "postid": "visitingmit", "internal_links": []}, "dying": {"post_title": "A Moment Before Dying", "tags": [], "post_content": "A Moment Before Dying\n=====================\n\nJanuary 18, 2007\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dying)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere is a moment, immediately before life becomes no longer worth\nliving, when the world appears to slow down and all its myriad details\nsuddenly become brightly, achingly apparent.\n\nFor Alex, that moment came after exactly one week of pain, seven days of\nsearing, tormenting agony that poured forth from his belly. Alex never\nliked his belly. Growing up he was always fat, surrounded by a family of\nbellowing, rotund Americans, who had a room in their house with\nwall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling cabinets, all entirely filled with bags\nand boxes of various pre-processed semi-organic assemblages, which they\nused to stuff their faces at all hours of the day.\n\nAlex had body image issues. He\u2019d avoid mirrors because he couldn\u2019t bear\nto look at himself, his large bulbous cheeks obscuring his fine\nfeatures. He avoided photos, covering his face or ducking out of the way\nwhen the click of the camera came, for the same reason: he didn\u2019t want\nto be confronted with the physical evidence of his disgusting nature,\nthought he could not go on living if he had to face the truth.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he got away from his family that he discovered his\nweight was not an immutable characteristic, like the fingerprints he\noften mused about burning off, like the dental records which had caused\nhim so much adolescent anguish, like the DNA he\u2019d heard so much about in\nschool. He would take off his shirt and stare at his stomach in the\nfull-length mirror. It was there, of course, hideous as ever, but also\nappreciably smaller. Its size, he realized, could change.\n\nSo Alex starved himself. Cut down from three meals a day to simply two\nand then to only one. And even that became superfluous most days. Alex\nsimply wasn\u2019t hungry.\n\nHe watched his stomach dwindle, monitored his progress on the electronic\nreadout of his at-home scale, charted the numbers on his computer,\nadmired the plunging trendlines.\n\nHe was doing so well. He told all his friends. The secret to losing\nweight, he would explain, is simply not eating. You just get used to it\nafter a while. He looked at the beggars outside his window and refrained\nfrom giving them change so that they too could experience this miracle.\nHe changed the channel when the radio began speaking about starvation in\nAfrica. \u201cStarvation isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou get used to it after\na while.\u201d He wondered whether the USDA thrifty food budget could be\nfurther reduced.\n\nHe stopped going out. His friends always wanted to meet him for meals,\nor for drinks, events in which Alex simply wasn\u2019t interested anymore.\nBefore long, Alex\u2019s friends were no longer interested in him.\n\nAlex started eating in caf\u00e9s, ordering a small pastry, sitting in a\ncomfortable chair, listening to the music play over the loudspeakers.\nSoon he stopped doing even that.\n\nAlex read on the Internet about death. There was a theory, increasingly\nwell supported, that eating is what killed you. They found that rats on\nextremely restricted diets, rats who ate very few calories, lived\nimpressively long. They saw the same results with other animals, up to\nand including chimpanzees. They suspected, but could not prove, the same\nwas true of humans. Every little bite of food was another step towards\ndeath.\n\nAlex started eating again. His appetite grew as slowly as it had\ndeclined but within months he was back to eating three meals a day. Food\nsuddenly gave him pleasure again. He savored the tastes on his tongue.\n\nOne night he and his friends decided to try a new restaurant. But when\nthe food came, Alex couldn\u2019t eat it. He thought it smelled funny. He let\nit sit there, his plate lying on the table, his food seething,\nuntouched.\n\nThe next night Alex couldn\u2019t sleep. He\u2019d wake up, feeling searing pains\nin his stomach, as if the food winding its way through his gut had\nspikes and was tearing apart the walls of his intestine.\n\nHe suffered like this for days, rolling on the floor in agony, unable to\nresist eating but every bite he ate causing him unimaginable pain. And\nstill, he could not stop.\n\nFive days in, it seemed like the worst had passed. The pains came less\nfrequently, the pains were less intense. He actually slept that night.\n\nThe day Alex killed himself, he was awoken by pains, worse than ever. He\nrolled back-and-forth in bed as the sun came up, the light streaming\nthrough the windows eliminating the chance for any further sleep. At 9,\nhe was startled by a phone call. The pains subsided, as if quieting down\nto better hear what the phone might say.\n\nIt was his boss. He had not been to work all week. He had been fired.\nAlex tried to explain himself, but couldn\u2019t find the words. He hung up\nthe phone instead.\n\nThe day Alex killed himself, he wandered his apartment in a daze. The\nlight streaming through the windows gave everything a golden glow, which\nhad the odd effect of making the filth he\u2019d become surrounded with seem\ncinematic.\n\nAlex wanted to go outside for one last meal, but he had trouble making\nthe appropriate connections. Jacket, shoes, pants, wallet. Each lay in a\ndifferent spot upon the floor. Alex knew they went together, he drew\nlines connecting them in his mind\u2019s eye, but it didn\u2019t see to fix\nanything, his eyes just kept bouncing from one item to another.\n\nFinally, he summoned the intelligence to put them on. The world seemed\nfunny afterwards. He noticed the way the key turned in the lock, like a\nhand rotating in front of his face, an interplay of light and shadow,\nobjects in space. He noticed the packages sitting at his doorstep,\nbegging him to open them, but their labels insisting that they were\naddressed to someone else. He noticed the frail old ladies who refused\nto obey the walk\u2014don\u2019t walk signs and instead walked slowly, backs\nhunched, across a major intersection.\n\nHe went to a new caf\u00e9 across the street, the one place he hadn\u2019t been to\nyet. Light streamed in through the huge picture windows, making the\nwhole place seem bright and airy. So much light, in fact, that the\noutside seemed a glow, as if the caf\u00e9 was suspended in the middle of a\npowerful white light. People held lowered, indistinct conversations.\nPeople on his left, people on his right, people behind him. But one\nconversation seemed to be coming from the ceiling. It might have been a\ntrick of the acoustics. He looked up and saw two speakers staring back\nat him and listened closely.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 was not playing music. It was playing a recording of two\npeople\u2019s lowered, indistinct conversation.\n\nThe day Alex killed himself, he had a sudden, powerful craving for a Key\nLime Sugar Cookie. It was odd the power the Key Lime Sugar Cookie had\nover him. Alex did not particularly like limes of any sort. In fact, the\nidea of an actual actual, as with all fruits, thoroughly disgusted him.\nHe hated how when he ordered sparkling water at fancy restaurants they\nwould place a lime wedge on the top of his glass, how he had to confront\nthe disgusting object every time he tried to take a sip, how touching\nthe lime, even to remove it, was so digusting as to be simply out of the\nquestion.\n\nAnd yet, here it was, this cookie, with the lime flavor baked into the\ncenter and large transparent grains of sugar embedded in the top,\nbegging for him, begging for one last taste. The cookie was sold\nexclusively by a publicly-traded chain of caf\u00e9s that tried hard to seem\ninternational, giving itself a foreign-sounding title and printing the\nnames of major world cities on every door, even though it had not\nexpanded much beyond the eastern half of the United States. Alex\npurchased the cookie.\n\nHe noticed the way he couldn\u2019t quite form the words to request it,\nsimply presented the cookie in front of the cashier and twitched his\nhead, assuming (correctly) that in context the request would be\nunderstood. He noticed the way his hands moved haphazardly to remove the\nappropriate amount of money from his wallet. He noticed the way his\nchange spilled out onto the counter as he tried to find the quarter with\nwhich to complete the transaction. He noticed the way he wobbled as he\nwalked as he took the now-purchased cookie outside.\n\nThe day Alex killed himself, he savored his one remaining cookie, the\nsweetness of the embedded sugar grains, the bizarre flavor of what must\nhave been lime. He used his tongue to wipe the remaining crumbs from his\nteeth, tossed the now-empty bag it had come in into the trash, and\nstepped out into the middle of the street.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1169107200.0, "postid": "dying", "internal_links": []}, "newswipe": {"post_title": "The Newswipe Manifesto", "tags": [], "post_content": "The Newswipe Manifesto\n======================\n\nAugust 24, 2009\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/newswipe)\n\n* * * * *\n\n*Charlie Brooker begins his recent BBC4 show*\n[Newswipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newswipe_with_Charlie_Brooker)\n*with this speech.

For a while there\u2019s nothing but\nmountains. Then a few curving strips of conformist suburbia. And then,\nall of a sudden, there it is. Rows and rows of building with no apparent\nstructure or direction, just going everywhere at once. Unlike every\nother city I\u2019ve seen from the air, LA has no gradient surrounding a\ndowntown. It just suddenly appears and then is simply there.\n\nDowntown looks about the way you\u2019d expect. Lots of tall buildings,\nstudded with odd landmarks like the new Gehry-designed concert hall and\na giant ocean liner-looking building which we determined to be the DMV.\n(\u201cOnly in California does the DMV get its own ocean liner,\u201d someone\nsays.) But this wasn\u2019t really LA, my guide explained. \u201cDowntown is just\nhollowed out factories and sweatshops.

The famed Venice Beach looks just like you\u2019d imagine \u2014 LA always\nmakes you think you are imagining \u2014 with shirtless skateboarders and\ngritty little shops and the beautiful blue ocean up against the clear\nblue sky \u2014 both so vast, so endless.\n\nI lie down on the sand and close my eyes. When you\u2019re trying to relax,\neveryone always says to imagine you\u2019re on the beach by the ocean with\nthe sun streaming down upon your face. But here I actually am and I\nstill can\u2019t relax. Instead, I wonder about the fractal nature of\ncoastlines \u2014 does their length grow with out bound or simply converge as\nyou measure them more finely? ([It grows without\nbound.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_Is_the_Coast_of_Britain%3F_Statistical_Self-Similarity_and_Fractional_Dimension))\n\n* * * * *\n\nMy host is danah boyd, the beautiful young academic superstar who has\nwon fame and fortune formalizing the teens on MySpace, then reporting\nher findings at conferences in wildly colorful outfits with youthful\nenthusiasm. She\u2019s living an academic dream \u2014 a one bedroom house by the\nbeach filled with books, with a handsome but quiet young boyfriend to\ndrop by on occasion.\n\nBut such a life is not all relaxation. She\u2019s editing special editions of\njournals, keynoting conferences, submitting papers hither and yon,\nconsulting on teen issues for major corporations, and interviewing kids\nfor her research. Even *The O\u2019Reilly Factor* is in on the racket, asking\nher, in that rhetorical way O\u2019Reilly has of interviewing guests, whether\nMySpace is a dangerous den of online sexual predators. (It is never\nmentioned that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s parent company has purchased MySpace.)\n\ndanah delights in pushing academic boundaries: skipping classes,\nskipping town, spelling her name in lower case, wearing crazy clothes,\nstudying the subcultural and new. And the rest of the field is\nscrambling to catch up with her, finally holding conferences and\nsubmitting papers on the sites she\u2019s been studying for years. I should\nbecome an academic, she says. Shake up the system just like her. But why\njoin the system in the first place?, I say.\n\nShe\u2019s got a fellowship down here this year along with Cory Doctorow, who\nshows up, arms wide, in a beaten leather jacket and a skullish t-shirt.\nWe grab barbecue down the street, taking Cory\u2019s car (the first one he\u2019s\nbought in his 35 years), outfitted with fuzzy seats and new plates that\nread \u201cCOPYFYT.\u201d\n\nCory hates San Francisco, but loves it here, where he gets to teach\nclasses with names like \u201cPwned: Is everyone on this campus a copyright\ncriminal?\u201d The freeway is fast, he says, the light rail usable, the\ncities surprisingly walkable. Disneyland is close by and there is plenty\nof \u201950s kitsch. And it\u2019s far cheaper living here than in London.\n\nCory is his usual flurry of activity \u2014 working on six books, teaching\ntwo classes, running one of the most popular blogs, fighting for our\ndigital civil liberties, while still managing to keep up with all the\ngossip. He hands me an advance proof of a book to read and recommends\nanother he\u2019s in the middle of. And on his way out he stands, framed in\nthe doorway, and offers me a piece of advice.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201c*Wired* really isn\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s an exciting time\nin tech industry \u2014 the cost of starting a company has fallen drastically\n\u2014 and you\u2019re at the center of it. I would have loved to have a job at\n*Wired* when I was 18.\u201d \u201cWired was very different when you were 18,\u201d I\nsay. \u201cYeah, I suppose so,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t want a job there\nnow \u2014 but then again I wouldn\u2019t want a job *anywhere*.\u201d\n\nAnd then he\u2019s off.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs Cory leaves Jeremy Iversen arrives. Iversen is an incredibly odd\nfellow. With a background in everything from investment banking to\nneurotheology, he came to my attention with his 2006 book *[High School\nConfidential](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743283635)*. With a\nnovelist\u2019s snark and an ethnographer\u2019s attention to character and\ninstitutional detail, he went undercover to a Southern Californian high\nschool for a half a year and wrote the whole thing down with a rare\nauthorial brilliance. ([My\nreview.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/undercoverlearning))\n\nNow the book\u2019s out and he\u2019s moved on again. This time he\u2019s trying to\njoin Hollywood, perhaps play himself in the movie version of the book.\nHe is sleek and abnormally attractive, but I learn this is the result of\na spectacularly careful regimen. Every four hours he takes a carefully\nmeasured amount of food out of a cryopack in his car, pretty much the\nonly food he is permitted. Then he follows a daily three-page\njargon-laden series of instructions from his trainer about which\nexercises to perform and how at the gym. This, combined with cold\nreading and audition classes, is now his job.\n\nIt seems like a waste, but just like danah likes messing with\ninstitutions, Jeremy likes trying new things. \u201cI\u2019ve done a fiction book,\nI\u2019ve done a nonfiction book, I\u2019m done with writing,\u201d he says. Fair\nenough; Jeremy amazes me with his many talents. Aside from his good\nlooks, his thoughtful eye, and his talent for writing, he\u2019s one of the\nsmarter people I\u2019ve spoken to lately, cracking jokes about Yugoslav\nloyalty and information-theoretic channel errors.\n\nHe also has amazing interpersonal skills. While danah and Cory bowled me\nover with their energy, leading me to sit quietly while they braindump\nnews and gossip, Jeremy\u2019s energy somehow invites my own, leading me to\ncrack jokes and make snarky comments right along with him. Perhaps this\nguy truly can do anything. Although that only leads to another question:\nwhy?\n\n* * * * *\n\nI hop in Jeremy\u2019s car (the very same the kids in his book were in!) and\nhe takes me on a tour of the city. First stop is Santa Monica and the\nSanta Monica Pier, home to a sewage treatment plant (which lots of\nsignage brags about) and the fortune telling machine that kicked off the\nplot in *Big* (I didn\u2019t have a quarter to get my fortune, sadly). The\ncrosswalk machines here talk and the stupid shopping mall jobs inspire\ntelevision pilots. There are large topiary dinosaurs along a promenade\nwith gingerbread houses underneath them to suggest Christmas. (Since the\nweather doesn\u2019t change, the city has to indicate the season in more\nblatant ways.) There is an entire store dedicated to selling things to\ngeeks, with golden chess pieces mixed in among the lightsabers and *Lord\nof the Rings* figurines. The wealthy pretty things stroll back and\nforth.\n\nMeanwhile in Westwood, home of UCLA, we see more shops and [Fox\nTheater](http://cinematreasures.org/theater/246/), home to many\nimportant movie openings. The students sit in cafes, pretending to work\nbut actually checking Flickr, while Jeremy insists I get a tazo milk tea\nwith boba. I do, against my instincts, and, to my surprise, it\u2019s\nactually quite good. Then we go back to strolling around LA\u2019s imitation\nof a college town. In most places college towns are kind of a step up\nfrom the surrounding environs, but in LA it seems the town is trying to\nslum down a bit to fit the mold.\n\nWe head to Beverly Hills, singing the appropriate songs (*living in\nBeverly Hills*), and get out to stroll along the famed Rodeo Drive. [A\ngiant nude\ntorso](http://www.publicartinla.com/sculptures/graham_torso.html)\ninexplicably welcomes us to a strip with shops so upscale that the\nstreetlights have been replaced by chandeliers in glass boxes.\nWell-dressed women carry their fashionably tiny dogs in Prada bags while\ntrendy young people sit in trendy restaurants, looking vaguely unhappy.\n\nSide streets curve off into a world of cobblestone steps even more\nimmaculately clean than the main drag \u2014 not a speck of dirt can be found\nanywhere. And then we find ourselves in the most bizarre three-story\nmall contraption, with an elevator that goes two floors above any\nsurrounding buildings, three restaurants bathing unhappy people in pink,\norange, and green light respectively, closed shops selling pink, orange,\nand green boxes, and a large glassed-in bedroom suspended literally in\nthe center of it all, with no apparent way to get in. Jeremy was\nconvinced we were in some kind of adventure game \u2014 if only we deliver\nthe pink boxes to the people in pink and so on, we\u2019d unlock the elevator\nwhich would bring us to the key to get into the magic bedroom. But then\nthe polygons stopped rendering so smoothly and we decided to move on, as\nI begun to wonder if I\u2019d stepped into some Virtual Reality simulation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEverything in LA looks so, well, cinematic. I always thought that filmed\nstuff looked better than my stuff because they used fancy lights,\ncameras, and lenses to give it that more lushful aesthetic. But\napparently all you really need to do is turn your camera on in LA \u2014\neverything here gives off that hyperreal, oversaturated vibe.\n\nAnd the people are all characters too. When I went down to Venice Beach,\nI saw attractive women sunbathing on towels while reading scripts. While\nwalking back, I heard a couple guys excited that the casting director\nhad actually called them back this time. The only other people I saw on\nthe street with identifiable occupations (and there are a shocking\nnumber of people wandering around the street in the middle of the day\nwith no identifiable occupation) were the immigrant landscapers busily\ntrimming hedges on the houses of their betters.\n\nI walked a block too far on the way back and ran into a more dingy\nneighborhood by a runned-down church. I looked around, trying to get my\nbearings, and a poor-looking black man on a bicycle with a cup rode up.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, assuming he wanted me to place some money in his cup.\n\u201cCan I help you find anything?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019re you\ndoing?\u201d he asked. \u201cJust looking around,\u201d I said. \u201cLooking for anything\nin particular?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cLooking for\u2026 crack?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said again, and he biked off.\n\n\u201cCrack is our number one industry,\u201d Jeremy says, \u201cwith entertainment and\nshipping as our secondary sectors.\u201d Apparently the whole city does coke,\nperhaps the one thing that unites these disparate neighborhoods, this\ncollection of varied enclaves each with their own name and culture that\nwe call Los Angeles. Not all of them, Jeremy explains, are even part of\nLos Angeles City. Some of them have received special dispensation to\ncarve out their little plot of land and get their own mayor. Santa\nMonica even elected a Green.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWe head towards Sunset, stopping to see a large bubbling pit of tar in\nthe middle of the city, right next to the Los Angeles County Museum of\nArt (LACMA), where even more high society people are standing around\nlooking unhappy, glassed in from the rest of the world \u2014 and the tar.\n\nWe also stop to see the world\u2019s tallest Christmas tree at The Grove\nshopping mall. Aside from one of the early flagship Apple stores, the\nGrove also has a trolley to take people around the outdoor mall. There\u2019s\nlittle objective need for the trolley \u2014 the mall isn\u2019t that big \u2014 but,\nas Jeremy says, it just adds to the surreality. To complete the picture,\nI couldn\u2019t resist purchasing a cinnamon sugar pretzel.\n\nAnd then we head to Sunset. There is the Laugh Factory, where Michael\nRichards recently dealt a large blow to his career. There are trendy\nclubs and music spots. And there are, of course, billboards; plenty of\nbillboards, advertising this and that as the street curves every which\nway.\n\nSoon things start to calm down and it\u2019s time for Jeremy to drop me off\nand hit the gym. We turn around, waving goodbye to all that. \u201cAnd that\u2019s\nLA!\u201d he says, as I clutch my chest and feel like my head is about to\nexplode.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe afternoon before I have to leave, I\u2019m lying on the couch, my\nheadache failing to fade.

I breathe in deeply.\n\nThe reflected sunlight before me refracts to form a perfect rainbow,\nstrips of dark red fading into orange fading into yellow then light blue\nthen blue. And for one beautiful moment, before the whole thing fades\naway into an inky blackness, the colors are laid out perfectly, just the\nway I\u2019ve seen them in prisms and diagrams so many times before, a\nbeautiful sympathy of color.

This\nis not exactly a popular combination \u2014 surely Chomsky and Ehrenreich\nhave more fans than Rorty and Lasch \u2014 but it is a provocative one.

The humanities seems to\nsuffer from something of the reverse problem: a tendency to be absorbed\nby the names of big people and not seeing beyond to the ideas they\nespouse.\n\nThe most extreme example is Leo Strauss, who encouraged his students to\nput aside their prejudices and fully imerse themselves in the worlds and\nminds of the greats. The greats were so great, Strauss suggested, that\nif you disagree with them, you probably just don\u2019t understand them well\nenough.\n\nBut even other teachers of philosophy have the same problem, presenting\nthe views of X and Y even when X is pretty clearly wrong. Despite its\nabsurdities, students must learn to understand X\u2019s view. This seems\nfairly universal; even books like *What is the Meaning of it All?*,\nwhich explains philosophy without the names or complex terminology,\nstill presents clearly bogus ideas on the same footing as more\nreasonable ones.\n\nIn other fields, this pattern is less frequent, but still there for\nwhole courses of research. In sociology, papers must cite long-dead\npatron theorists to lend their empirical research an air of legitimacy\nby presenting it as a member of a recognized family. Even more recent\nworks, like Annette Lareau\u2019s brilliant *Unequal Childhoods*, are at\npains to show how they adhere to a theoretical model (the recently-alive\nBourdieu in that case). In most other fields, the theorists take pains\nto make sure their work is consistent with the evidence, not the other\nway around.\n\nEven in most humanities classes, the course content consists of a series\nof papers making arguments. The goal of the class is to understand the\nview of the authors and determine (in the best ones) to what extent you\nagree or disagree.\n\nThis isn\u2019t particularly unreasonable, but is a far cry from life in the\nhard sciences, where usually there is an actual consensus on some\nsubject and otherwise there are a couple of named theories, each being\ndeveloped by a group of people.\n\nWhy the diference? First, is it perhaps hard science that\u2019s in the\nwrong? I don\u2019t think so. The goal of science is to discover the truth\nabout the world. Truths remain true no matter who says them and it\u2019s\nunlikely that one person will discover the whole truth. Thus the pattern\nof letting multiple people develop a theory and try to find evidence for\nit to convince the others.\n\nSo why don\u2019t the softer sciences follow the same model? The problem gets\nworse the softer you get, which suggests the problem lies in the\nsoftness itself. The problem is that without identities, one has to\njudge the ideas themselves which, in a soft science is somewhat\ndifficult to do.\n\nIt\u2019s easy in science to run an experiment and see if it proves a theory\ntrue or false, it\u2019s much harder to get consensus about a reasonable\ntheory of morality in philosophy. But it is easy to pick out the famous\nin academy culture and assign their stuff.\n\nIdentity fetishism thrives in a world afraid to make its own judgments.\nIt exalts the thinkers of the past and, in doing so, diminishes its own\ncapacities. But science must march forward instead of backward and that\nrequires the daring to distinguish true from false.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1164096000.0, "postid": "idfetish", "internal_links": []}, "mitfirealarm": {"post_title": "SFP: Fire Alarm", "tags": [], "post_content": "SFP: Fire Alarm\n===============\n\nJune 16, 2005\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mitfirealarm)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne of the hazards of dorm life is that fire alarms are always going\noff.

Running a startup is\n*hard*! That and finally having people to talk to sort of takes some of\nthe time and desire out of writing. I\u2019m thinking maybe instead of a full\nblow-by-blow account of what happened, I\u2019ll write posts about different\ntopics, that will recap the story so far. My first attempt follows. -ASw\n\nLife seems so incredibly overworked and overcomplicated that you pare it\ndown to the bare essentials: eat and code. Surely you should be able to\nhandle this without distraction. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not so easy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLet\u2019s take eating.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve always had a problematic relationship with food. I\nalways liked plain things \u2014 the year before college I lived mostly off\nof eating plain, microwaved bagels. At oriental restaurants I would\nalways just order steamed white rice. Wes Felter, noting I would\napparently only eat white food joked, referencing a Science Fiction\nnovel, that I would eat light bulbs, but \u201conly the white ones\u201d. This\nreached its extremes at a World Wide Web conference where all the food\nwas white, even the plate it was on. Tim Berners-Lee later pulled my\nmother aside to share his concerns about this diet.\n\nFinally, one day at an oriental restaurant by Stanford (years before I\nwent to school there), we had the typical discussion except this time\nCory Doctorow spoke up: \u2018are you sure you\u2019re not a supertaster?\u2019 he\nasked. I had heard the They Might Be Giants song but never considered\nthe possibility. I thought about it as the conversation continued and it\nseemed to make sense to me. [At this point I imagine a crane shot\nlifting up and up over the conversation at the restaurant. Fade to:] I\ndid some research on the Internet and did the test (which formally\nconsists of putting blue food coloring on your tongue, taking a piece of\npaper with a three-hole punch, placing it over the tongue and counting\nthe number of taste buds in it) and indeed, I am a supertaster. This\nhasn\u2019t eliminated the discussions about my eating habits, but it does\nshift the blame.\n\nIn any event, I\u2019m not one for the fine arts of cooking. So it\u2019s always\nseemed attractive to me to have a simple food that tastes decent that I\ncan just pull out and eat whenever I want. And, lo, it appeared that I\nhad found it: Cheerios. Cheerios claimed on the box to be healthy, they\nhad little in the way of taste, I could eat them whenever I want, they\nhad big boxes of them at the corner grocery store \u2014 everything seemed\ngreat. Cheerio boxes piled up in the corner. (Photo to follow.)\n\nThere were some problems, though. I didn\u2019t eat them with water or milk,\nwhich meant that a fine Cheerio dust went everywhere. This dust was so\nfine that it got into invisible cracks in my laptop\u2019s surface and\napparently bonded with the metal and had to be scraped out each time I\nate. And then I begun to discover that the Cheerio dust was also into my\nsystem, possibly even my lungs and giving me some Cheerio form of\nsilicosis; they made it difficult to breathe deeply. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be\nironic if I died of pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?\u2019 I\nasked Simon. (I chose pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis as a\nspelling word in 6th grade.)\n\nAt the same time, I was suffering from bouts of acid reflux which\ncontinued to grow in frequency and severity. First just some acid. Then,\none night walking back from a Noam Chomsky lecture, I began to cough of\nwhat felt like my stomach lining. I gave up the Cheerios but it didn\u2019t\nhelp. Last night I threw up my entire dinner.\n\nAnd then what do I eat instead? We go for regular meals at 12 and 6 but\nI\u2019m only sporadically hungry and the food is getting boring. In Science\nFiction stories, we imagine small packets of food that are healthy but\ntaste like whatever we enjoy. Forget that, I\u2019d be happy with just\npackets of food that are healthy. I\u2019m sick of having to worry about\nfood.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAnd then there\u2019s programming. When I\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019ll have bouts of\njust amazing productivity, doing everything that needs to be done in\nhours. The only problem is that these good days are followed by a week\nof bad ones, where I feel tired or depressed or scared and can\u2019t quite\nforce myself to sit and face the code.\n\nI used to think this was just cowardice, that I just needed to sit down\nand program and I\u2019d get the same level of productivity again. But what\nif this is some serious limit in my brain? What if programming takes so\nmuch out of me that it takes days to recharge? I\u2019ve never seriously\nconsidered this possibility before, but it\u2019s not just fatalism \u2014 it has\nreal implications for how I should structure my days.\n\nThe last time I was fighting procrastination I was watching a bunch of\ngood television shows. And as part of this, I would read Tim Goodman,\nthe Roger Ebert of television critics. I was struck to learn one day\nthat even Tim Goodman, whose job was to literally sit down and watch TV,\ncould not bring himself to accomplish this task. I mean, I knew all\nabout [Structured\nProcrastination](http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html)\nbut surely it had its limits. How could someone procrastinate sitting\ndown and watching TV? And yet, here it was before my eyes \u2014 my favorite\ntelevision critic, a hardworking and thoughtful man who had even spent a\ncolumn answering a question I sent him, even though I lived in Chicago\nat the time.\n\nThe lesson I drew from this is that the human mind is such that whatever\nyou do, it will try to avoid it. So you might as well aim high. Now the\nquestion is: what do you do with the rest of time?\n", "external_links": ["http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html"], "time": 1122966000.0, "postid": "eatandcode", "internal_links": []}, "kindledetails": {"post_title": "Apple and the Kindle", "tags": [], "post_content": "Apple and the Kindle\n====================\n\nNovember 3, 2011\n\n[Original link](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kindledetails)\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Amazon Kindle is full of all sorts of amazing, delightful touches \u2014\nthe sort of thing you\u2019d expect from an Apple product. For example, when\nyou first take your Kindle out of its (gorgeous!) box, it boots right up\nknowing your name and logged into your account. This is actually\nout-Apple-ing Apple: it\u2019s possible because Amazon not only controls the\nhardware and the software, but the entire distribution channel; they\nknow exactly who is going to get each Kindle.\n\nAnd think about how the original Kindle came with a *lifetime*\n*unlimited* *worldwide* data plan. Imagine how much that must have cost!\nAll so that you never had to think about syncing again: your Kindle was\nautomatically synced, no matter where it was in the world.\n\nBezos must have spent tons of energy getting this stuff right. And he\nmust be sitting there, pissed, that Steve Jobs gets all these laurels\nwhile no one ever recognizes the stuff he\u2019s done. But I don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s because Jobs is a better marketer and showman than Bezos (that\u2019s\nthe easy way out); it\u2019s because the small details that delight get\nburied under small details that annoy.\n\nFor example, if you download a sample of a book and get to the end and\ndecide to purchase the whole thing, the sample doesn\u2019t expand to\ndownload the remainder of the book \u2014 instead the full book downloads\ncompletely separately and you have to manually copy over all your\nhighlights and annotations to the full one. (You can\u2019t just keep them in\nthe sample because sample\u2019s don\u2019t even sync; you have to download a\nsample manually to each of your devices and hand-synchronize the page\nnumbers.)\n\nOr (and this is incredibly aggravating) when you select a word in the\nKindle, depending on how common a word it is, the option that comes up\nhighlighted by default is either \u201cfull definition\u201d or \u201cstart highlight\u201d.\nSince e-ink\u2019s refresh rate is so slow, you typically don\u2019t see what\u2019s\nactually come up until you\u2019ve pressed the button for the second time. So\nI often \u201cdouble click\u201d on words to highlight them, but some percentage\nof the time this kicks me over into the dictionary and I have to hit\nback twice to get out.\n\nAnd this is all before I\u2019ve even got to the disastrous incompatibilities\nbetween the Kindle device, the Kindle for Mac app, the Kindle for iOS\napp, the Kindle Online Reader (read.amazon.com), and the\nkindle.amazon.com social network \u2014 all of which are full of gruesome\ninterface annoyances of their own.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about delightful details: they\u2019re not just another\nthing you can add on top. Unless you sweat the details all the way\nthrough the user experience, the ones that delight quickly get drowned\nout by the ones that constantly annoy. I hope someone at Amazon will\ntake that to heart.\n", "external_links": [], "time": 1320303600.0, "postid": "kindledetails", "internal_links": []}}
